How do these measures compare with evidence from other countries, and what determinants (e.g., parental education and income levels) affect mobility outcomes?"
601,8,"The paper asks: 'Does intergenerational labor mobility influence personal attitudes toward tax payment (tax morale) among European citizens, and how do factors such as income class, government commitment to equal opportunities, and family ties moderate this relationship?'"
602,4,"The paper asks: Can digital factor participation break intergenerational hierarchical solidification and create opportunities for rags to riches by facilitating upward income mobility? It examines the potential of digital participation to enable poor second generations to leapfrog traditional barriers, thereby mitigating the transmission of wealth across generations."
603,2,"The paper empirically investigates the determinants of intergenerational income mobility by decomposing the channels through which parents influence their children’s income. Specifically, it asks: How do different sources—employment for low-income families, education for middle-income families, and capital income (including bequests and business contacts) for high-income families—contribute to income persistence? It also examines the role of progressive public transfers in moderating these intergenerational effects."
604,2,"The paper asks: How does intergenerational income mobility vary over time and across regions in New Zealand, and to what extent is this variation statistically associated with income inequality, particularly following the policy reforms of the 1980s?"
605,4,"The paper asks: How do parental income levels and occupational characteristics contribute to intergenerational income mobility? In particular, it investigates whether occupational segregation by parental income leads children to follow parental career paths and examines the extent to which intergenerational occupational persistence explains the income rank‐rank relationship."
606,1,"The paper primarily focuses on measurement and methodological advances. It asks how to improve the measurement of intergenerational income mobility by using conditional rank-rank regression, which allows for distinguishing between within-group and between-group persistence of income. In essence, it seeks to reformulate the usual rank-rank regression to better capture intergenerational income persistence and address the interpretability issues that arise when additional covariates are included."
607,3,"The research question asks: 'In more centralized fiscal systems, is there less spatial inequality in the economic mobility outcomes of low-income children?' This question examines how institutional and geographic fiscal structures relate to economic mobility outcomes."
608,2,"The paper primarily seeks to determine how individuals’ origins and circumstances—including parental wealth, sex, and territorial characteristics—influence economic outcomes through the lenses of social mobility and inequality of opportunity. In doing so, it provides empirical estimates of these determinants across Chile, Colombia, and Mexico."
609,2,"The paper empirically investigates how physical urban spatial characteristics (such as size, population density, and connectedness) impact equality of opportunity measured by intergenerational mobility and are associated with income, wealth, and social capital. In essence, it asks: How do urban features determine intergenerational mobility and economic outcomes, and how have these relationships evolved over time?"
610,3,"How do desegregating residential moves via the Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program impact long-run economic and social outcomes—including lifetime earnings, wealth accumulation, marriage patterns (including interracial marriage), and subsequent neighborhood choices—for children who experienced these moves?"
611,4,"How does the transmission of inherited wealth—especially considering racial differences—serve as a dominant predictor of class mobility in American society, and what does this imply for the reproduction of our economic structure?"
612,2,"The research empirically investigates whether and how education and gender shape Australia’s intergenerational earnings mobility. In particular, it asks: “Do education and sex matter for Australia’s intergenerational earnings mobility?” It further examines if children who attain higher education than their parents, as well as gender differences between sons and daughters, affect the intergenerational earnings elasticities and the role of educational attainment as a mediator."
613,7,"The paper asks how the process of intergenerational transmission—including statistical issues inherent in iterated regressions, the roles of market luck, indirect transmission, multiple skills, and the influence of grandparents and parental income—affects the relationship between intergenerational and multigenerational mobility. In other words, it examines how elementary properties of the transmission process can lead to biased (overly high) predictions of long-run mobility."
614,2,"Research question: Does economic mobility, as measured by income and educational attainment, differ across socio‐economic groups, and can differences in the intergenerational transmission (persistence coefficients) of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities explain this heterogeneity?"
615,7,"The paper extends an existing theoretical model to address two main research questions: (1) How does a more decentralized (mixed) school financing regime influence household incentives for private investment in children's education, and how do these incentives affect social mobility and income inequality? (2) For a given school regime, how does an increase in intergenerational mobility affect income inequality through the strengthening of households' demand for public education spending?"
616,4,"The paper asks: (a) When capital market imperfections are endogenized, do poor but talented families experience greater intergenerational mobility—a question that examines if forcing high‐ability borrowers to invest extra in human capital reduces inequality in the long run? And (b) can imperfections in contract enforcement explain cross-country differences in productivity through inefficient resource allocation? These questions focus on intergenerational income mobility and inheritance effects within a theoretical model framework."
