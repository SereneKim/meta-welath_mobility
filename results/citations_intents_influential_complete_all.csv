(2014a) drew on federal income tax records for more than 10 million children born in the early 1980s, which they linked to their parents.', 'Furthermore, Chetty et al. (2014a) reported that the unweighted correlation between mobility for predominantly whites and the full sample is 0.', 'As a first step to disentangle the underlying channels of persistence, I examine whether any of the five broad factors highlighted by Chetty et al. (2014a) as the most important correlates of upward mobility—family structure, income inequality, school quality, segregation, and social capital—can account for the link between earlier slavery and current mobility.', 'By pairing county-level data from the 1860 census containing information on the prevalence of slavery with recent mobility estimates for commuting zones (CZs) from Chetty et al. (2014a), I show that CZs where slavery was more prevalent by the outbreak of the Civil War exhibit considerably less upward mobility today.(2) Figure 1 illustrates the CZ–level link between the share of the population enumerated as slaves in the 1860 census and several complementarymobility measures (described in more detail in the next section). Consistently, these binned scatterplots suggest that intergenerational transmission of economic status is higher in areas with more prevalent slavery and that children growing up in these CZs have substantially lower expected earnings in adulthood relative to children born to parents at similar income levels elsewhere in the country. For example, the average probability that a child born to parents in the bottom income quintile will reach the top quintile in adulthood is roughly 4 % in the CZs with the highest prevalence of slavery, whereas it exceeds 10 % for children in CZs with no recorded slaves in 1860 (see Fig. 1, panel b). Although the correlations in Fig. 1 are highly suggestive, the negative link between slavery and upward mobility may simply reflect a confounding factor, such as lower historical levels of industrial development or a more unequal distribution of income and wealth in the American South rather than slavery per se. However, conditioning on a wide range of historical and modern development outcomes leaves the negative link between slavery and upward mobility largely unaffected, suggesting that it does not mainly reflect the fact that places exposed to slavery were (or are), on average, less economically developed. A related concern is that the observed relationships may arise from a sorting of families with worse potential mobility outcomes into areas with more prevalent slavery, rather than reflect a causal effect of place. Using data from Chetty and Hendren (2016a, 2016b) to estimate the causal effect of each CZ on upward mobility net of sorting, however, I show that places with more prevalent slavery indeed exhibit negative place-level effects on the opportunity for economic advancement among children from low-income families, as depicted in Fig. 1, panel d. Last, to further support a causal interpretation of this relationship, I document that this link is also evident when using within-state variation in slavery and mobility, limiting the sample to the 15 historical slave states at the eve of the Civil War, and exploiting geographical differences in the suitability for growing cotton as the basis for an instrumental variables (IV) strategy. As a starting point to understand why places with more prevalent slavery produce worse mobility outcomes, I conclude by examining the extent to which the five factors highlighted by Chetty et al. (2014a) as the most important correlates of upward mobility within the United States—family structure, income inequality, school quality, segregation, and social capital—weaken this link.', 'A good starting point to disentangle the persistent effects of slavery on mobility patterns is to ask whether any of the factors that Chetty et al. (2014a) identified as the most important correlates of mobility across CZs (family structure, income inequality, school quality, segregation, and social capital) can account for the fact that areas with higher slave shares by the outbreak of the Civil War exhibit substantially lower upward mobility today.', 'Additional CZ characteristics are drawn from Chetty et al. (2014a) and are described in more detail in the notes for Table 4.', 'By pairing county-level data from the 1860 census containing information on the prevalence of slavery with recent mobility estimates for commuting zones (CZs) from Chetty et al. (2014a), I show that CZs where slavery was more prevalent by the outbreak of the Civil War exhibit considerably less upward mobility today.', 'Similarly, alternative measures of (income) segregation derived by Chetty et al. (2014a)—such as the extent to which the bottom and top income quartiles are isolated from families at higher and lower income levels, respectively—do not affect the estimated link between slavery and mobility (not reported).', 'To obtain such measures, Chetty et al. (2014a) drew on federal income tax records for more than 10 million children born in the early 1980s, which they linked to their parents. Merging information on parental household income with children’s family income in adulthood (when they are approximately age 30) allows for a characterization of mobility patterns in nearly all CZs in the United States.(3) In the main analysis, I use three complementary measures of mobility derived in Chetty et al. (2014a) that have been made publicly available at the CZ level through the Equality of Opportunity Project.', '1 See Aaronson and Mazumder (2008), Long and Ferrie (2013), Clark (2014), and Chetty et al.

The factors driving the decrease in absolute mobility differ among countries. In Australia and the United States the decrease is mainly due to increasing income inequality.

Esping-Andersen/Wagner (2010) take father-son EU-SILC data for five countries (Denmark, Norway, Italy, Spain and France) and find substantially higher mobility in Nordic countries than in Italy and Spain in particular. The difference is mostly explained by a “bottom-up” process of equalization. The scholars show that the advantages associated with descending from well-off origins are persistent, however, such advantages also exist in the two Nordic countries. Causa et al. (2009) provide comparable estimates of intergenerational wage and education persistence across 14 European OECD countries with EU-SILC data. Income persistence for sons is particularly strong in Southern European countries as well as in the United Kingdom, whereas Nordic countries show lower persistence, which is also true for Austria. However, income persistence is measured as the percentage increase in wages of an offspring having a father with tertiary education relative to an offspring having a father with below-upper secondary education. Further, the results suggest nonlinear effects and a higher persistence in the tails and in particular at the top. Finally, Franzini/ Raitano (2009) exploit EU-SILC data and measure the effects of parental financial distress on the educational attainments and wages of the offspring. The scholars embed their results into a framework of welfare regimes and reveal substantial differences with regard to regime clusters. Again, Nordic countries perform best concerning intergenerational mobility. Aside from the analysis of linear effects in the intergenerational transmission of income, another strand of literature deals with differences in elasticities across the income distribution of offspring. Since transmission mechanisms and policy conclusions may be entirely different for either tail of the distribution, it is necessary to analyze nonlinear trends in intergenerational mobility. The issue of nonlinearities in intergenerational earnings mobility was raised by Atkinson et al. (1983: 114) thirty years ago: “The proportion of upwardly mobile sons from the bottom 20 percent appears to be considerably higher and the proportion of downwardly mobile sons from the top 20 percent appears to be lower.” Most of the earlier studies, which consider the issue of nonlinearity, have done so in order to test the conjecture of Becker/Tomes (1986) who imply a concave relationship between the earnings of parents and their descendants.', 'Examples of earlier research are Atkinson (1981) and Dearden et al.

Pioneering work by Peters (1992), Solon (1992) and Zimmerman (1992) demonstrated that estimates of the IGE could be improved by averaging over three to five years of parental earnings. Averaging over multiple earnings observations reduces attenuation bias by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of observed earnings. Overall, studies into classical errorsin-variables bias point to averaging over multiple years of parental earnings observations as one method to reduce attenuation bias, however it is likely that many years of earnings data are required to eliminate this source of bias (Mazumder, 2005a). Another line of research finds evidence of association between the size of classical attenuation bias and the age at which short-run proxies of parents’ earnings are observed. Baker and Solon (2003) and Mazumder (2005a) use large earnings datasets for men from Canada and the United States to show that the variance of the transitory component of observed earnings, Var (u1i ), follows a U-shaped pattern over the lifecycle, reaching its lowest point around age 40 (see Figure 2 in Mazumder 2005a, p.']",3.0,34.0,179,18,22,78

Our analysis is most closely related to contemporaneous work by Graham and Sharkey (2013), who use survey data to estimate relative mobility using log-log specifications in a subset of cities in the U.S. Their estimates are correlated with ours, but do not permit an assessment of absolute mobility and are naturally less precise due to limitations in sample size. Our approach of within-country comparisons offers two advantages over the cross-country comparisons that have been the focus of prior comparative work. First, differences in measurement and econometric methods make it difficult to reach definitive conclusions from cross-country comparisons (Solon 2002, Black and Devereux 2011). The income measures and covariates we analyze here are all measured using the same data sources across all CZs. Second, and more importantly, we can characterize both relative and absolute mobility across CZs by using national ranks to measure children’s outcomes. The cross-country literature has focused on differences in relative mobility, partly because it is difficult to compare the absolute standard of living across very different economies. Although the literature on cross-country differences in economic growth has characterized differences in mean absolute living standards across nations, much less is known about how the prospects of children from low-income families vary across countries when measured on a common absolute scale (Ray 2010). Our analysis also relates to the literature on neighborhood effects, reviewed by Jencks and Mayer (1990) and Sampson et al. (2002). Many of the correlations we explore are motivated by hypotheses proposed in this literature, such as the impacts of concentrated poverty (Wilson 1987), residential', ', Bjorklund and Jäntti 1997, Jäntti et al. 2006, Corak 2013).

(2013), we ask how much of the income correlations across generations could be accounted for by social mobility, and we estimate the degree of overlap between income and social class mobility to be 30–50 percent.', 'Blanden et al. (2013) pointed out, however, that these two paths are not exhaustive of the ways in which parental and child incomes may be linked. There may be covariances between, on the one hand, the residual term in the parent’s equation and child’s class position, which establishes a path between parent’s and child’s income equal to cov(epXc)bc, and between the residual from the child’s equation and parental class, giving rise to the path cov(ecXb)bp. Figure 1 presents the resulting model of the relationship between income and class mobility, with parental characteristics in the upper part and filial in the lower. The thick vertical arrow represents the intergenerational covariance of incomes: our goal is to explain how intergenerational class mobility contributes to generating this covariance. On the right side of the figure we see the arrow linking parent’s and child’s class and on the left side the covariance between the error terms of equations (4) and (5). The elements added by Blanden et al (2013) are shown by the diagonal lines linking parent and child, and they allow for the possibility that factors independent of parent’s class but related to parent’s income are correlated with child’s class position, and that parent’s class is correlated with other child factors, independent of child’s class, that influence child’s income.', 'Blanden et al.

Becker and Tomes establish the idea that the current generation of a family can increase their consumption only at the expense of the future generation (Becker, 1979). In that sense, families attempt to maximize a utility function that spans multiple generations. As a result of this cross-generational utility function, families with less income will have less opportunity to invest in their children’s human capital, because they will need to use those resources for more immediate needs that are vital for survival such as food and clothes. At the same time, families with more disposable income would be able to use their money to invest in their children by means of hiring private tutors, prep classes or standardized test preparation books. Based on this framework, higher levels of family income should correspond to higher human capital for youths, and therefore higher income when these youths become adults. This system perpetuates the groups of families with high human capital (and by extension high income), and causes the groups of families with low human capital (and by extension low income) to remain in their respective socioeconomic classes. This idea, coupled with human capital theory, provides the basis for the expectation that lower family income in youths’ families should correspond with lower income when they are adults living on their own. The main economic theory that my paper will draw from is human capital theory. An investment in human capital is any activity that is able to raise a worker’s productivity. Human capital theory says that the higher an individual’s human capital (and therefore productivity), the higher their wages should be. Families, and in particular parents, have the ability to invest in their children’s human capital, in such a way indicated by Becker and Tomes (1979). In theory, the more one’s parents invest in their human capital, the more productive they will be.', 'An explanation for these results in the context of the model provided by Becker and Tomes (1979) is that when maximizing the cross generational utility functions, families in this study with more income were able to invest more heavily in their children’s human capital, while still tending to their immediate needs. Along with being in agreement with the theory, these results are similar to the results of studies done previously. Peter’s paper asked the question, “Does there exist a culture of poverty that is passed on from parents to children?” (Peters, 1992, p. 456). The result of Peter’s study is that changes in parent’s income can explain about 10% of changes in income as adults for their children. This suggests that the answer to the question posed is yes. My study also suggests that there is a culture of poverty that is passed on from parents to children. The results of the study conducted by Corcoran et al. (1992) were that being from a lowincome family had negative effects on future income.', 'One of the highly cited and foundational theories in income inequality and income mobility comes from Becker and Tomes (1979). Becker and Tomes establish the idea that the current generation of a family can increase their consumption only at the expense of the future generation (Becker, 1979).

In theory, the more one’s parents invest in their human capital, the more productive they will be. This leads to the expectation that belonging to a family whose cross-generational utility function allows them to make investments into their children’s human capital will cause higher productivity in their children, and therefore higher wages as an adult. This theory is the basis for the first research hypothesis of this paper, which is: the higher ones standard of living as a youth, the higher their income as an adult will be. There are a number of academic research articles that also draw on human capital theory in order to study income mobility across generations. Elizabeth Peters (1992) conducted an empirical analysis that relates one’s parent’s income to their own income later in life. This is similar to the research question of this paper, which relates the standard of living as a youth to income later in life. Peters poses the question at the beginning of her article that she attempts to answer: “Does there exist a culture of poverty that is passed on from parents to children?” (Peters, 1992, p. 456). This is essentially the question that I hope to address as well, and the work of Becker and Tomes (1979) would suggest this to be true, as impoverished families would have less to invest in their children in terms of human capital.', 'One of the highly cited and foundational theories in income inequality and income mobility comes from Becker and Tomes (1979).

Numerous studies suggest that this positive correlation between a father’s education level and his children’s incomes does exist (e.g., see Björklund et al. 2006; Haveman and Wolfe 1995; Oreopoulos et al. 2006). However, the IV approach is not targeted to provide an unbiased IIE estimate, but to provide an upper limit. Given the assumption that the father’s education is positively correlated with the son’s income, Solon (1992) shows that the IV approach provides an upper bound of the IIE. Besides measurement errors from transitory income shocks, Grawe (2006) and Haider and Solon (2006) show that the IIE estimates could also be biased by life-cycle bias. They find that an individual’s permanent income will be underestimated if his earlier-life income is used to proxy his permanent income and will be overestimated if his later-life income is used. Therefore, IIE estimates fall as the father’s age increases, keeping the son’s age constant. The estimates increase as the son’s age increases, keeping the father’s age constant. A couple of potential techniques can be used to reduce the life-cycle bias. First, both of the studies show the life-cycle bias is smallest if midlife income is used to proxy permanent income. A second and less preferred method in Grawe (2006) is to draw income of both generations from a similar point in the life cycle. This could also arguably reduce the life-cycle bias. A third method is to use a second long panel data set to project earnings and bring predictions back to the original short panel data set of interest, given the assumption that both data sets have the same age-earning profiles. We use the two approaches introduced by Solon (1992) to estimate the IIE of China using the CHNS data from 1989 to 2006. In addition, we try to reduce the life-cycle bias.5 In the first set of regressions, we choose to pair a son’s latest income information with the father’s earliest because, as shown in Grawe (2006) and Haider and Solon (2006), the life-cycle bias is the smallest if midlife income is used to proxy permanent income.', 'For example, Becker and Tomes’s (1979) theoretical model shows that a father’s education level contributes to his and his offspring’s determination of human capital investment decisions and hence to his offspring’s incomes.

Besides measurement errors from transitory income shocks, Grawe (2006) and Haider and Solon (2006) show that the IIE estimates could also be biased by life-cycle bias. They find that an individual’s permanent income will be underestimated if his earlier-life income is used to proxy his permanent income and will be overestimated if his later-life income is used. Therefore, IIE estimates fall as the father’s age increases, keeping the son’s age constant. The estimates increase as the son’s age increases, keeping the father’s age constant. A couple of potential techniques can be used to reduce the life-cycle bias. First, both of the studies show the life-cycle bias is smallest if midlife income is used to proxy permanent income. A second and less preferred method in Grawe (2006) is to draw income of both generations from a similar point in the life cycle. This could also arguably reduce the life-cycle bias. A third method is to use a second long panel data set to project earnings and bring predictions back to the original short panel data set of interest, given the assumption that both data sets have the same age-earning profiles. We use the two approaches introduced by Solon (1992) to estimate the IIE of China using the CHNS data from 1989 to 2006.', 'For example, Becker and Tomes’s (1979) theoretical model shows that a father’s education level contributes to his and his offspring’s determination of human capital investment decisions and hence to his offspring’s incomes. Numerous studies suggest that this positive correlation between a father’s education level and his children’s incomes does exist (e.g., see Björklund et al. 2006; Haveman and Wolfe 1995; Oreopoulos et al. 2006). However, the IV approach is not targeted to provide an unbiased IIE estimate, but to provide an upper limit.

Statisticians have to assume that respondents declare at least an approximation to their real incomes, which potentially could lead to distortions if the assumption is violated. Especially at both tails of the income distribution, there could be a tendency to over– or understate the incomes in survey data. However, we assume that these distortions are equally distributed in cross–country comparisons, since we do not suspect that the biases are systematically different by country. Descriptive statistics of the variables of interest in this paper are given in the appendix in Table A.2. Concerning the measurement of parental earnings, one obvious problem is the lack of data. Facing the scarcity of information, numerous scholars chose roundabout routes for the analysis of intergenerational mobility. Björklund/Jäntti (1997), for instance, estimate intergenerational income correlations for independent samples of fathers and sons, since income data for two related generations were not available in Sweden.', 'Österberg (2000) analyzed Swedish tax-data files to examine intergenerational transmissions of earnings status.', 'Österberg 2000) lack data for working time, the EU–SILC is equipped with such data, and we are therefore able to correct for potential working time biases.

Using a correlation curve follows the recommendation in Blanden (2011) to complement the elasticity with a correlation coefficient, and, in addition, the measure is local, which allows a varying degree of association as recommended in Bratsberg et al.']",0.0,12.0,98,5,1,55

More recent work using Danish data by Bingley and Cappelari (2018) suggests that once one more carefully accounts for heterogeneity in the intergenerational transmission process and models the entire lifetime income process, then it appears that parent income can explain a substantial amount of the sibling correlation.']",1.0,109.0,660,47,60,117

The Great Gatsby Curve (Corak, 2012) has certain policy recommendations.

Clark (2014) and Clark and Cummins (2015) find high persistence of wealth across five generations using data on rare surnames in England and Wales between 1858 and 2012, and Barone and Mocetti (2016) find significant positive wealth elasticities as well as occupational persistence for families in Florence between 1427 and 2011.(5) While these data are less amenable to statistical inference, Clark (2014) and Clark and Cummins (2015) argue that wealth, education, or occupational status are transmitted via an underlying and unobserved latent factor which is a representation of abilities, preferences, dynastic network connections, or other relevant characteristics.

Our research complements these studies by studying an alternative institutional context. Different from both studies, we find that access to an elite college education matters greatly for one’s income rank but does not differentially benefit students from modest and wealthier family backgrounds in China. These differences across countries suggest that the role of elite education in shaping mobility may vary greatly across societies. China’s test-based college admissions system has been criticized for many reasons, including that it kills creativity (Zhang et al., 2012). Many argue that China should change its “exam-centered education” (yingshi jiaoyu) to “quality-oriented education” (suzhi jiaoyu). To do this, some suggest that China might consider the multiple-factor college admission system in the United States (You and Hu, 2013), which places less of an emphasis on exams. There is little empirical evidence, however, that enables us to understand the benefits and costs of different systems. Our study sheds light on the admissions system, and our results suggest that inequality in access to elite colleges would likely increase if China adopted the system in the United States. Our study has at least two caveats. First, child income is measured as first-job wages, a proxy for early-career labor income. As a result, our estimate of the relationship between parental income and child income does not measure lifecycle intergenerational mobility.(7) Nevertheless, the wage rank of the first job is highly predictive of the wage rank of one’s later occupation), which is treated categorically. (6)They acknowledge that the observed difference in the intergenerational gradient by college tier could be driven by differential selection on ability or heterogeneity in completion rates.

The adjusted R2 in the first stage, 0.393, is relatively larger than the other studies in Table 5: Piraino (2007) with 0.322, Mocetti (2007) with 0.301, Nicoletti and Ermisch (2008) with 0.', 'However, Haider and Solon (2006) showed that λt varies over a life cycle, which needs not equal to one, and the estimator is biased by a factor of λt . Also, see Solon (1992) for the attenuation bias when there is a classical measurement error in both the son’s and the father’s earnings.', 'Murphy and Topel (1985) and Pagan (1984) showed that standard two-step procedures not accounting for generated regressor problems underestimate standard errors of the consistent second-step estimators and that corrected standard errors are larger than their uncorrected counterparts.', 'Korea went through a great expansion in education in the last few decades, and the parent-child schooling correlation among 20–69 sons in 2008 is only 0.333, one of the lowest values according to Hertz et al.
