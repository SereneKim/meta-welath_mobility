The cross-sectional implications of the theory and U.S. data are used to restrict the parameters of human capital technology. We then assess the model's ability to explain the cross-country data. Our quantitative model generates a total-factor-productivity (TFP) elasticity of output per worker of 2.8. This implies that a factor of 3 difference in TFP is amplified through physical and human capital accumulation to generate a factor of 20 difference in output per worker --- as observed in the data between rich and poor countries. The implied difference in TFP is in the range of estimates from micro studies. The theory suggests that using Mincer returns to measure human capital understates human capital differences across countries by a factor of 2. The cross-country differences in human capital implied by the theory are consistent with evidence from earnings of immigrants in the United States. We also find that TFP has substantial effects on cross-sectional inequality and intergenerational mobility and that public education policies can have important aggregate and distributional implications.,We develop a quantitative theory of human capital with heterogeneous agents in order to assess the sources of cross-country income differences.

The first essay looks at human capital from a growth perspective. Essays two and three focuses on the individual’s occupational decision and its relation to family background.The first essay attempts to capture the effects on long run economic growth and transitional dynamics of the interaction between human capital and R&D. We do this by allowing for endogenous human capital accumulation in an economy where the number of products and technologies expands because profit maximizing entrepreneurs do R&D. We find that, in the absence of scale effects, long run growth is determined by the economy’s capacity to accumulate human capital. A relative lack of R&D capital causes the economy to grow slowly during its transition to the steady state, while a relative abundance of R&D capital gives high growth rates during transition.In the second essay, the classical Roy-model of selection on the labor market is extended in order to analyze intergenerational mobility. This is done through the introduction of ability uncertainty that is linked to family background. In contrast to to additional human capital models of intergenerational mobility, this mechanism rather than differences in access to capital markets links occupational oucomes of offspring to parents. We study the effects of income redistribution on mobility and talent allocation. It is found that redistribution has implications for intergenerational mobility and talent allocation through its influence on individual occupational choices. However, we conclude that the presence of a trade-off between redistribution and intergenerational mobility depends on the extent of similarity of occupations with regard to ability sensitivity and wage rates, and on the degree of individual risk aversion. Whether redistribution occurs only within an occupation or simultaneously within and across occupations is also inportant for the implicatons for mobility and talent allocation.In essay three, a model of occupational choice and human capital investment is developmed and tested. The model allows family background to influence occupational choice through access to economic resources, differences in costs of schooling, and ability uncertainty linked to background similar to that discussed in essay two. It is predicted that life time utility of children from less well-off background is more sensitive to economic incentives when risk aversion is strong. The model also predicts that people are more sensitive to economic incentives when considering occupations distant from their parent occuations. The implications of the theoretical model are tested and largely confirmed on Swedish data using a mixed multinominal logit framework which explicitly accounts for unobserved ability heterogeneity.","This dissertation consists of three essays, taking different perspectives on human capital.

The first essay looks at human capital from a growth perspective. Essays two and three focuses on the individual’s occupational decision and its relation to family background.The first essay attempts to capture the effects on long run economic growth and transitional dynamics of the interaction between human capital and R&D. We do this by allowing for endogenous human capital accumulation in an economy where the number of products and technologies expands because profit maximizing entrepreneurs do R&D. We find that, in the absence of scale effects, long run growth is determined by the economy’s capacity to accumulate human capital. A relative lack of R&D capital causes the economy to grow slowly during its transition to the steady state, while a relative abundance of R&D capital gives high growth rates during transition.In the second essay, the classical Roy-model of selection on the labor market is extended in order to analyze intergenerational mobility. This is done through the introduction of ability uncertainty that is linked to family background. In contrast to to additional human capital models of intergenerational mobility, this mechanism rather than differences in access to capital markets links occupational oucomes of offspring to parents. We study the effects of income redistribution on mobility and talent allocation. It is found that redistribution has implications for intergenerational mobility and talent allocation through its influence on individual occupational choices. However, we conclude that the presence of a trade-off between redistribution and intergenerational mobility depends on the extent of similarity of occupations with regard to ability sensitivity and wage rates, and on the degree of individual risk aversion. Whether redistribution occurs only within an occupation or simultaneously within and across occupations is also inportant for the implicatons for mobility and talent allocation.In essay three, a model of occupational choice and human capital investment is developmed and tested. The model allows family background to influence occupational choice through access to economic resources, differences in costs of schooling, and ability uncertainty linked to background similar to that discussed in essay two. It is predicted that life time utility of children from less well-off background is more sensitive to economic incentives when risk aversion is strong. The model also predicts that people are more sensitive to economic incentives when considering occupations distant from their parent occuations. The implications of the theoretical model are tested and largely confirmed on Swedish data using a mixed multinominal logit framework which explicitly accounts for unobserved ability heterogeneity.","This dissertation consists of three essays, taking different perspectives on human capital.

However, there is evidence that younger generations are making later transitions into home ownership and increased numbers not entering at all—this is not just among low-income earners but also middle-upper income Australians aged 25–44. Even so, parental transfers—those occurring while parents or relatives are alive ('inter-vivos' transfers) or after they die ('bequests')—might have an important role in overcoming intergenerational inequities by assisting people to enter first home ownership. This study used longitudinal data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia Survey (HILDA) to model the impact of transfers on the likelihood recipients enter home ownership and its impact on overall distributions of wealth. The study found that receipt of a bequest increases home ownership rates among beneficiaries by 4 to 8 percentage points, and outright ownership by 10 percentage points compared to non-recipients. The probability of entry into first home ownership increases at or just after a bequest is received. Large inter-vivos gifts (over $5000) are also associated with transition into home ownership. Bequests and inter-vivos gifts are also associated with recipients purchasing higher value housing compared to those not receiving such gifts. While inter-generational transfers of this type appear to be beneficial for the younger generation that receive them, it is clear the net effect is regressive for overall wealth distribution. This is because renters are less likely to receive transfers compared to those already in home ownership. This suggests that there is a clear potential for housing transfers to play a role in wealth becoming more concentrated over time. The findings help initiate a discussion around how large wealth holdings held by older generations that have benefited from increasing house prices might be unlocked for the benefit of younger generations while relieving pressure on government budgets. However, it also highlights the importance of tax and transfer policies in redressing inequities within generations, including how to target those groups that might miss out on intergenerational transfers.","Home ownership is valued not just for the housing it provides but also as a means to accumulate wealth over the life-cycle.

The first essay looks at human capital from a growth perspective. Essays two and three focuses on the individual’s occupational decision and its relation to family background.The first essay attempts to capture the effects on long run economic growth and transitional dynamics of the interaction between human capital and R&D. We do this by allowing for endogenous human capital accumulation in an economy where the number of products and technologies expands because profit maximizing entrepreneurs do R&D. We find that, in the absence of scale effects, long run growth is determined by the economy’s capacity to accumulate human capital. A relative lack of R&D capital causes the economy to grow slowly during its transition to the steady state, while a relative abundance of R&D capital gives high growth rates during transition.In the second essay, the classical Roy-model of selection on the labor market is extended in order to analyze intergenerational mobility. This is done through the introduction of ability uncertainty that is linked to family background. In contrast to to additional human capital models of intergenerational mobility, this mechanism rather than differences in access to capital markets links occupational oucomes of offspring to parents. We study the effects of income redistribution on mobility and talent allocation. It is found that redistribution has implications for intergenerational mobility and talent allocation through its influence on individual occupational choices. However, we conclude that the presence of a trade-off between redistribution and intergenerational mobility depends on the extent of similarity of occupations with regard to ability sensitivity and wage rates, and on the degree of individual risk aversion. Whether redistribution occurs only within an occupation or simultaneously within and across occupations is also inportant for the implicatons for mobility and talent allocation.In essay three, a model of occupational choice and human capital investment is developmed and tested. The model allows family background to influence occupational choice through access to economic resources, differences in costs of schooling, and ability uncertainty linked to background similar to that discussed in essay two. It is predicted that life time utility of children from less well-off background is more sensitive to economic incentives when risk aversion is strong. The model also predicts that people are more sensitive to economic incentives when considering occupations distant from their parent occuations. The implications of the theoretical model are tested and largely confirmed on Swedish data using a mixed multinominal logit framework which explicitly accounts for unobserved ability heterogeneity.","This dissertation consists of three essays, taking different perspectives on human capital.

Tertiary education is also heavily subsidized. By making the risk of human capital investment more acceptable, especially to low wealth households, subsidies may increase investment in human capital, lower long-run inequality, and reduce aggregate precautionary savings. However, subsidies also encourage more poorly prepared students to attend and are usually financed via distortionary taxes. In this paper, we find that observed collegiate subsidies improve welfare substantially relative to the fully decentralized (zero subsidy) outcome. We show that subsidies help smooth consumption, lower skill premia, increase interest rates as precautionary savings fall, lower the inequality of both consumption and wealth, increase intergenerational income mobility and raise welfare, even when financed by distortionary taxes.","Tertiary education in the U.S. requires large investments that are risky, lumpy, and well-timed.

types of inequality would a§ect growth through opposite channels, so
the relationship between inequality and growth would depend on which
