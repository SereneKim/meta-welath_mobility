Using the method of TS2SLS, this paper estimates the overall and the structure of intergenerational income mobility in recent China. After careful consideration of potential life‐cycle, attenuation and co‐residence biases, our preferred intergenerational income elasticity is 0.41 for father–children and 0.56 for mother–children, which suggests a low level of intergenerational mobility. We then focus on the structure of the mobility regarding age cohort, gender, ethnicity, region, registration type and income percentile. By investigating possible channels, our results show that (a) the role of non‐cognitive characteristics, cognitive abilities, education, occupation and party membership jointly account for nearly 63% of intergenerational transmission, (b) education and occupation are two dominant channels, and (c) non‐cognitive characteristics and cognitive abilities have direct and indirect effects on intergenerational transmission.",,Weibo Yan; Xiao-lan Deng,empirical,,empirical,,

These changes have the effect of sharply limiting or eliminating the expected intergenerational income flows from or through children leading to limitations on family size. This modification and extension of Caldwells wealth flows model facilitates an analysis of historical regional and social class-specific differences in the onset and pace of the demographic transition and points to new macro-level socioeconomic indicators. Claims of a modified wealth flow theory are supported by data from the Caribbean where there have been significant changes in the moral economy of childbearing and family relationships. The authors modifications to wealth flow theory incorporate several new macro-level indicators: change in opportunity structure between time t-n and time t (defined as the percent of the labor force engaged in agriculture around 1980) the ability to use formal schooling to create and/or maintain acceptable material standards of living (defined as the product of the percentage change of proportion of the labor force in agriculture in 1960-80 and secondary school enrollment as a percent of age group) and a culturally relevant starting point (defined as the product of the crude birth rate in 1960 and the natural logarithm of the 1960 infant mortality rate). Future research needs to specify more rigorously the model using measures of real wage rates and agricultural mechanization as well as nonagricultural employment. Also needed specification is a model for fertility at the micro-level that includes an explicit linkage with macro-level variables. Such analyses may resolve puzzling discrepancies between fertility trends and trends in education infant mortality and family planning encountered by studies focused on aggregated data.,W.

singular importance to a change in the direction of intrafamily intergenerational transfers and an associated shift in parental motivations to bear and rear children from economic to psychic advantages which accompanies socioeconomic development and modernization. In 2 recent papers this author initiated a longterm project with the goal of constructing an economic theory of the demographic transition. Early work on this project has several parallels with Caldwells theory and with an independent statement of a similar view by Ryder. The work also emphasized the connection between fertility and the intergenerational distribution of income and consumption within the family and attempts to trace the mechanisms by which socioeconomic development may lead to fertility transition. This paper represents both a summary and extension of the recent work and related theoretical literature with emphasis on its application to demographic transition theory. The main substantive conclusions follow from the assumption that modern economic development is driven by sustained technological change that is translated into growth in real income via investments in human and physical capital. At a given rate of population growth a rise in the productivity of human and physical capital due to improved technology increases the mean age at which it is optimal for an individual to produce his/her lifetime wealth relative to the age at which lifetime wealth is consumed in steady state. This in turn tends to shift the steady state direction of net intergenerational transfers from a situation in which the young transfer to the old under primitive technological conditions to a situation in which the old transfer to the young with more advanced technology. In the former case a rise in population growth increases per capita wealth and welfare and in the latter case it reduces them. The author concludes his reexamination of the Caldwell hypothesis by advancing an alternative version that reverses the line of causation that he emphasizes and instead emphasizes the crucial role that the family and particularly parental altruism plays in the process of economic development. A purely self interested older generation refuses to reduce its consumption either directly of indirecly via intermediary institutions that operate in impersonal private markets because the benefits of the investment are reaped by the younger generation after the older generation is dead. On the other hand an older generation of altruistic parents considers the success of their sons and daughters as a substitute for their own success.,In explaining the demographic transition Caldwell in a series of papers has given singular importance to a change in the direction of intrafamily intergenerational transfers and an associated shift in parental motivations to bear and rear children from economic to psychic advantages which accompanies socioeconomic development and modernization.

persistent gap in economic status between blacks and whites in the United States has been a topic of considerable interest among social scientists and policymakers for many decades. The historical legacy of slavery and segregation raises the question of how long black Americans are likely to remain a disadvantaged minority. Despite the enormous literature on black-white inequality and its historical trends, few studies have directly measured black-white differences in rates of intergenerational mobility, that is, the ability of families to improve their position in the income distribution from one generation to the next. Estimates of rates of intergenerational mobility by race can provide insight on whether racial differences in the United States are likely to be eliminated and, if so, how long it might take. Furthermore, they might also help inform policymakers as to whether there are lingering racial differences in equality of opportunity and, if so, what the underlying sources for these differences are. More generally, the relatively low rate of intergenerational mobility in the United States compared with other industrialized countries has been a growing concern to policymakers across the political spectrum. (1) Understanding the sources of racial differences in intergenerational mobility might also shed light on the mechanisms behind the relatively high degree of intergenerational persistence of inequality in the United States. In this study, I attempt to advance our understanding along several dimensions. First, I use two data sets containing larger intergenerational samples than have been used in the previous literature. One of the data sets matches individuals in the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to administrative earnings records from the Social Security Administration (SSA). This matched data set provides many more years of data on parents' earnings than most surveys and is likely to be less prone to measurement error, since it is derived from tax records. In addition, the SIPP contains data on key characteristics of the parents, such as wealth levels and marital history. The other data source I use is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). In addition to containing a rich array of information as children transition from adolescence to adulthood, such as test scores and personality traits, the NLSY also measures total family income in both generations, giving it an advantage over the SIPP. Using a measure of economic status that includes the income of the spouse avoids selecting only women who participate in the labor market. Second, I use two types of measures of intergenerational mobility. The first is a set of transition probabilities of relative income status across generations. An example is the probability of moving out of the bottom quintile of the income distribution from one generation to the next. Hertz (2005) was the first to use transition probabilities to examine black-white differences in intergenerational mobility. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), Hertz found that blacks were less upwardly mobile and more downwardly mobile over generations than whites. Since then, a few other studies mostly using the PSID have found similar results. (2) The second set of measures, called directional rank mobility, compares whether the rank of a child in the income distribution is higher or lower than their parents' rank in the previous generation. (3) Both types of measures are able to distinguish upward movements from downward ones and can be measured at different points in the income distribution. The directional rank mobility measure is a useful complement to the transition probability because instead of using an arbitrarily chosen cutoff, it uses a natural yardstick, one's own parents' rank. As I discuss later, the directional rank mobility measures also appear to be very robust to many measurement issues. …",,,empirical,,empirical,,

This paper uses transition probabilities and measures of “directional rank mobility” that can identify interracial differences in intergenerational mobility. The study uses two data sources including one that contains social security earnings for a large intergenerational sample. I find that recent cohorts of blacks are not only significantly less upwardly mobile but also significantly more downwardly mobile than whites. This implies a steady-state distribution in which there is no racial convergence in income. A descriptive analysis using covariates reveals that test scores in adolescence can explain much of the racial difference in both upward and downward mobility. Family structure can account for some of the racial gap in upward mobility but not downward mobility. Completed schooling and parental wealth also appear to account for some of the racial gaps in intergenerational mobility.,"In recent decades, blacks have experienced substantially less upward mobility and substantially more downward mobility from one generation to the next than whites. These results are shown to be highly robust to a variety of measurement issues. The author examines rates of intergenerational mobility by race and asks whether such racial differences in the U.S. are likely to be eliminated and, if so, how long it might take.",B.

The U.S. saving rate is less than half that of Japan, Germany, and other developed countries, and the imbalance in saving rates across countries is responsible, in large part for the imbalance in international trade. This book examines a number of important determinants of wealth accumulation, including retirement bequests, and precautionary saving motives, demographics, the tax structure, social security, and insurance institutions. Using a blend of theory, empirical research and simulation methods, it reaches some surprising conclusions about what determines savings. Kotlikoff notes that most of U.S. wealth is due not to life cycle saving for retirement but rather to bequests and other intergenerational transfers. The process of passing wealth from one generation to the next may be explained, in large part, because of imperfect annuity arrangements. In addition to life span uncertainty, the author points out other types of uncertainty such as uncertainty about future medical expenditures can greatly stimulate saving. Fiscal policies, such as unfunded social security, can dramatically alter a country's wealth, although the process can take many years. Unfortunately, Kotlikoff observes, official fiscal deficits are intrinsically unreliable for measuring the government's stance of fiscal policy. He also concludes that the baby busts currently underway in the United States, Europe, and Japan are likely to improve overall economic welfare despite their detrimental impacts on social security systems",L.

of the meaning of 'chronic poverty,' and identifies frameworks for analysing it, as understood by the Chronic Poverty Research Centre (CPRC) during the initial stages of research. After an introduction to the CPRC, the second section briefly reviews the major frameworks for conceptualising, defining, explaining, and measuring poverty in its broader sense, and relates these to the study of chronic poverty. It is suggested that research undertaken by CPRC should focus on poverty in its broadest, multi-dimensional sense, and that those who are chronically poor are likely to be poor in several ways, not only in terms of income. At the same time, the analysis of money-metric and other quantitative indicators are the primary means by which study of chronic poverty is presently undertaken, and will continue to have an important role to play in research. Our understanding of chronic poverty is also likely to draw upon notions of both absolute and relative poverty, vulnerability, social exclusion, and capabilities and freedoms, as well as upon subjective assessments by the poor themselves. In the third section, the characteristics of chronic poverty are presented. Long duration is identified as both necessary and sufficient for poverty to be considered chronic. It is hypothesised that chronic poverty will also often be multi-dimensional and severe. It is proposed that a five-tiered categorisation of the poor be adopted - always poor, usually poor, churning poor, occasionally poor and never poor - and that transitions between different levels over time be closely monitored. It is suggested that the tightest possible definition of chronic poverty would be intergenerationally transmitted (IGT) poverty, which is likely to be relatively intractable and therefore likely to escape current poverty reduction efforts. In this way, IGT poverty is both a characteristic and cause of chronic poverty. The subsection on IGT poverty draws upon the literature surrounding the intergenerational transfer of different capitals. This is followed by an analysis of the ways in which severity and multi-dimensionality are often characteristics of chronic poverty, and a brief review of the relevance of the World Bank's Voices of the Poor studies to an understanding of chronic poverty. The final two subsections argue that the chronically poor are a heterogeneous group. There are several sets of people who are particularly susceptible to chronic poverty, and that are likely to experience multiple and overlapping vulnerabilities. These groups include those experiencing deprivation because of their stage in the life cycle, those discriminated against because of their social position in the community or household, those with health problems and impairments, and people living in remote rural areas, urban ghettos and regions where prolonged violent conflict and insecurity have occurred. In the fourth section, the causes of chronic poverty at different levels of analysis are explored, and analytical frameworks for their understanding are laid down - quantitative panel data analysis; livelihoods analysis; freedoms; social and political exclusion; and policy analysis frameworks, which include consideration of avoiding the negative impacts of development which help to extend and deepen poverty for the poor. The final two sections bring together the preceding work and discuss the implications of our initial understanding of chronic poverty for future research.","This paper provides an overview of the meaning of 'chronic poverty,' and identifies frameworks for analysing it, as understood by the Chronic Poverty Research Centre (CPRC) during the initial stages of research.

It can also be looked on as a problem in convex programming in a space of infinite sequences of real numbers. The literature on optimal economic growth contains several papers in which a utility function of the form (1) U(x1,x2,...) = Summation, t=1 to t=infinity, of alpha (superscript(t-1)) u(x sub t), Oalpha1, is maximized under given conditions of technology and population growth. Here xt is per capita consumption in period t, and u(x) is a strictly concave, increasing, single-period utility function. Alpha is called a discount factor. A generalization of (1) has been proposed under the name stationary utility, and is definable by a recursive relation (2) U(x1, x2, x3,...) = V(x1, U(x2, x3,...)). One obtains (1) by V(x, U) = u(x) + alpha U. The natural generalization of alpha in (1) to stationary utility is the function (2a) alpha(x) = (the partial derivative of V(x,U) with respect to U) subscript U = U(x,x,x,...). In this paper we study the maximization of (2) under production assumptions.",R. Beals; T. Koopmans,false,false,false,false,

I analyze mean and quantile regression coefficients as well as transition matrices to investigate family earnings mobility between parents and daughters and parents and sons from Swedish register data. My findings indicate that Sweden has a higher degree of mobility compared to the United States, and that assortative mating also plays an important role as a channel through which income status is transmitted across generations in Sweden. However, the difference in intergenerational mobility patterns between the two countries does not, inherently, depend on factors that affect the marriage match. Swedish daughters and sons exhibit a rather similar scheme of intergenerational earnings transmission. Daughters tend to be slightly more mobile than sons, and the difference between their elasticity estimates is small but statistically significant.

EGGEBEEN Pennsylvania State University ADAM DAVEY University of Georgia* A sample of parents (aged 50+) drawn from the 1988 and 1992 waves of the National Survey of Families and Households was used to examine two questions: How responsive is support from adult children in times of need? Is support from children greater for those who expected their children to provide help? Parents who experience one or more transitions in the time between survey waves are likely to receive help from their adult children over and above previous exchange patterns. Responsiveness on the part of children does not appear to be linked with parental expectations, however. Neither general value orientations about what children should do to support parents, nor expectations of help from one's own children in hypothetical situations are related to children's responsiveness to parental needs. Results are consistent with a contingent exchange perspective on intergenerational relationships. Key Words: aging, filial responsibility, intergenerational relations, parent-child relationships. Popular imagery, as well as theory, holds that most older Americans can readily call on a network of kin assistance in times of need (Antonucci, 1990). Consistent with this idea, a number of studies show that most adults have regular contact with their adult children and report that their children would be important sources of assistance in a crisis (Eggebeen, 1992; Wellman & Wortley, 1990). Other research, however, suggests that anticipated support is only moderately correlated with actual support (Hogan & Eggebeen, 1995). We directly test the linkage among expected support, needs, and support rendered in response to needs. We make use of the 1988 and 1992 waves of the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). These panel data allow, for the first time, direct examination of the responsiveness of exchanges of support from adult children to the onset of four transitions or potential crises experienced by their parents: the loss of a spouse, a substantial drop in income, a decline in health, and a change in functional status. We also examine whether the support parents received from their children in times of need is greater for those who expected their children to provide help. In other words, is the confidence that parents have that their children will step to the fore when they need help warranted? THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL BACKGROUND Scholars have brought to bear a number of theoretical perspectives to explain why individuals give help to family members. One common explanation focuses on altruistic or benevolent behavior, which arises out of the attachments between family members (Becker 1974, 1991; Becker & Tomes, 1976). The basic idea is that because they care about their children, parents monitor their children's well-being and make transfers when needed to modify that well-being. Although Becker's original model is centered around the benevolence of parents, there is no reason why it cannot be generalized to account for the motives of other family members. Likewise, Bengtson's hypothesis of the generational stake suggests that flows of support should be directed primarily toward younger generations, although norms for all forms of solidarity are bidirectional (Bengtson & Schrader, 1982). This explanation seems plausible, but tests of the existence of altruistically motivated patterns of intergenerational exchange have been mixed. Hogan, Eggebeen, and Clogg (1993) found some support for altruistically based exchanges. Other things being equal, adult children with widowed or infirm parents gave more than children whose parents were not widowed or in poor health. However, a number of other studies find little support for altruistically based models of intergenerational resource flows (Cox, 1987; Cox & Rank, 1992; MacDonald, 1989). In contrast to altruistic models of intergenerational support is the idea that the flow of resources is largely determined by exchange relationships between parent and child. …","DAVID J.

We find that: (i) men are more responsive to the wage differential between wage/salaried employment and self‐employment; (ii) liquidity constraints are more important for men; and (iii) the link between father's self‐employment status and the probability of self‐employment is stronger for men. Taken together, these results suggest that, for women, self‐employment is a closer substitute for part‐time work and labour‐market inactivity than it is for men. We attribute such differences to the different labour market opportunities and occupational strategies of women.

The views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent official positions of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis or the Federal Reserve System. Notes Holtz‐Eakin et al. (Citation2000) find evidence of this for the USA. Nevertheless, the issue of whether entrepreneurs create jobs has been debated in the literature that typically focuses on the extent at which new jobs are created in small or large firms, with some mixed results. See Brown et al. (Citation1990) for an overview. Although the percentage of women apprentices has increased markedly since the 1950s, they are still underrepresented in the dual apprenticeship system. In 1996, women made up 43% of all apprenticeship graduates, which is a great improvement over the 25% share in the 1950s. However, women apprentices concentrated in a small number of specialised occupations that, generally, offer fewer prospects for promotion and/or entrepreneurial opportunities. Striking differences in women's participation are evident in certain sectors of the vocational training system such as the crafts and medical/legal assistant sectors. For example, while women made up almost 93.9% of medical or notary assistants, they made up only 21.5% of crafts graduates (see Tremblay and Le Bot, Citation2003). Kunze (Citation2002) provides evidence that occupational segregation in Germany is a main factor for the observed gender wage gap, following apprenticeship training. Schiller & Crewson (Citation1997) run separate estimations for men and women, but are interested in the determinants or entrepreneurial success rather than the decision to become self‐employed. Also, Hundley (Citation2000) addresses the difference in self‐employment earnings of men and women, but not self‐employment itself. Start‐up financial capital is also an important factor in determining the success and longevity of the entrepreneurial venture. See for example, Bates (Citation1990) who finds that firms with larger financial capital at start‐up are considerably more likely to succeed. As which much of the literature, Dunn and Holtz‐Eakin do not consider female self‐employment, and, therefore, does not examine intergenerational transfers to daughters. Because our study includes men and women, it offers a partial remedy. Unfortunately, though, our dataset does not indicate the employment status of a person's mother. New entrants into self‐employment face a high risk of ‘failure’ in the early years of their self‐employment venture (Bates, Citation1990; Taylor, Citation1999). Taylor, for example, finds that of those who became self‐employed in Britain during the 1990s, 41% exited self‐employment in the first year, while only one‐third survived the first four years. See OECD (Citation2000) for a discussion of self‐employment around the world. There is no information on mothers' self‐employment status in the GSOEP data. See Meager (Citation1994) for more details and a comparison with similar programmes in Europe. See Ondrich et al. (Citation1996) for a more detailed discussion of the German Mutterschutzgesetz provisions. Because of a paucity in our data set of males not in the labour force, we combine the ‘unemployed’ and ‘out of the labor force’ categories into ‘not working’. The definitions of all variables used are in the Appendix Table A1. Self‐employment earnings in the GSOEP are self‐reported and do not include negative values (capital losses). Some studies have used accounting information on profits/losses, but, even then, reported profits may not accurately reflect true profits due to underreporting. In general, measuring and interpreting self‐employment earnings is a difficult task that may explain why the self‐employed are excluded from many labour market studies. Aware of such difficulties, Hamilton (Citation2000) uses a number of different earnings measures to ensure the robustness of his results when comparing earnings differentials between paid employment and self‐employment. Unfortunately, there is no information in the GSOEP that will allow us to use similar earnings measures as in Hamilton (Citation2000). This is identical to the method used by Bruce et al. (Citation2000), in which independence of irrelevant alternative restriction is imposed on the error term. As CitationAlvarez and Nagler (forthcoming) show, this restriction poses few problems in practice. For a description of the GSOEP see Wagner et al. (Citation1993). The self‐employed in our sample are a very diverse group in terms of occupations and the nature of self‐employment. However, very few of the self‐employed are highly educated professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, which is in contrast with the USA (Georgellis & Wall, Citation2000b). For a good discussion regarding issues of measurement and definition of self‐employment see Section 3 in Blanchflower (Citation2000). The conditions to report positive earnings and self‐employment as the main activity before some is classified as self‐employed is consistent with the quite often accepted convention not to classify unpaid family workers as self‐employed on the grounds that they are not entrepreneurs, but the assistants of entrepreneurs (Marshall, Citation1999). The relatively small number of observations on women is due to the fact that many self‐employed women work in a family business and/or do not report self‐employment earnings. For a discussion and a test of the screening hypothesis see Riley (Citation1979). Lazear & Moore (Citation1984) argue that earnings–experience profiles should be steeper for salaried‐employees than for the self‐employed. The explanation they offer is that employers ‘underpay’ workers during their initial years in the job and ‘overpay’ them at later years in order to reduce principal–agent problems, is not relevant for the self‐employed. However, the results do not lend support for the Lazear–Moore hypothesis. Negative selection into self‐employment could imply that individuals maybe forced into this sector by disadvantages in wage/salary employment and/or that they are motivated by factors other than earnings. We proxy wealth by the sum of income from rent, interest and dividends. Gill (Citation1988) also uses the same measure for wealth as we do, although Taylor (Citation1996) uses housing equity instead. Although initial vocational training, just prior to workers' labour market entry or during the early stages of their career, can be critical in this regard, there is evidence that further training schemes also enhances gender inequality in the German labour market (Georgellis & Lange, Citation1997). As a referee pointed out, the issue of women's greater access to husbands' wealth is not as straightforward as our assertion implies. Indeed, strong social norms and/or even the reluctance on the part of women to exercise the divorce option to access men's accumulated earnings may counterbalance the egalitarianism of existing laws on marital property. For both males and females, a Wald test for the joint significance of the coefficients indicates statistical significance at the 5% level. Descriptive evidence from the GSOEP shows that about 60% of men and women who become self‐employed are between 25 and 45 years of age. As a referee pointed out, the reduced time and devotion to the business when pre‐school children are present could impose a substantial opportunity cost for women considering self‐employment as an alternative to salaried work. As Hundley (Citation2001) argues, women in self‐employment appear to be burdened by housework and childrearing in ways that limit the scope of their business and the intensity of work effort in them. This view is also supported by evidence provided by Lin et al. (Citation1998) who find that indeed the presence of pre‐school children has a negative impact on self‐employment survival in Canada. But generally, the evidence on the effect of children on self‐employment success and survival is rather mixed. In contrast, there is a clearer picture emerging regarding the positive effect of children on women's probability of becoming entrepreneurs. See, for example, Macpherson (Citation1988), Lombard (Citation2001) and Connelly (Citation1992). Bruce (Citation1999) finds evidence that intrahousehold transfers of entrepreneurial human capital might make it more likely that women who are married to self‐employed men are themselves more likely to be self‐employed.","This paper examines the factors that influence transitions into self‐employment, paying particular attention to gender differences. We find that: (i) men are more responsive to the wage differential between wage/salaried employment and self‐employment; (ii) liquidity constraints are more important for men; and (iii) the link between father's self‐employment status and the probability of self‐employment is stronger for men. Taken together, these results suggest that, for women, self‐employment is a closer substitute for part‐time work and labour‐market inactivity than it is for men. We attribute such differences to the different labour market opportunities and occupational strategies of women.",Y.

This question is important, owing to the size of the current demographic cohort of youth, globally but especially in the majority world, as well as the large stake, and strong influence, that today's youth will have in the development trajectories and future sustainability of food systems. Although youth is often framed as an age category for policy and bureaucratic purposes, this simplification obscures important dimensions of what being a youth means and entails. It makes comparisons and generalizations simple but misleading, because age-based classifications are nationally and culturally specific. In this paper, we argue that youth is better understood relationally, as a transitional phase within the life course. While every human being depends on consuming food, their individual transition from childhood to adulthood involves – as a very stylized generalization – a significant enlargement of autonomy and independence, as well as an increased likelihood of being substantially and directly involved in the production, distribution, procurement and/or preparation of food, as well as its consumption. However, each person's youth transition and their relationship with food systems is uniquely shaped by specific intersections with multiple factors including gender, class, wealth, health, location, intergenerational relationships, and many others. We conclude that there are only a few, important but not necessarily dominant, ways in which youth as a group have special stakes in food systems. We elaborate on this complex picture and identify some principles to guide development research and policy that seeks to engage with youth in relation to the sustainable transformation of food systems.","What, if anything, is special about youth with respect to engagement in food systems?

However, few studies have analyzed black-white differences in intergenerational income mobility and the factors that determine these differences. This is largely due to the absence of appropriate methodological tools. We develop nonparametric methods to estimate the effects of covariates on two measures of mobility. We first consider the traditional transition probability of movement across income quantiles. We then introduce a new measure of upward mobility which is the probability that an adult child's relative position exceeds that of the parents. Conducting statistical inference on these mobility measures and the effects of covariates on them requires nontrivial modifications of standard nonparametric regression theory since the dependent variables are nonsmooth functions of marginal quantiles or relative ranks. Using NLSY data, we document that blacks experience much less upward mobility across generations than whites. Applying our new methodological tools, we find that most of this gap can be accounted for by differences in cognitive skills during adolescence.",Error fetching abstract,,both,,empirical,,https://www.chicagofed.org/%7E/media/publications/working-papers/2007/wp2007-12-pdf.pdf

Our main findings are the following. The secondary effects of social origins-their effects via the educational choices that young people make given their prior academic performance-are clearly operative across five key educational transitions within the English educational system. More specifically, we estimate that 35% of the total effect of social origins is secondary in the earliest transition that we consider, and from 15% to 20% in the subsequent four. Furthermore, mediation analyses reveal that secondary effects are most strongly associated with parental education and then, to a lesser degree with parental status, while little association exists with parental class and none at all with parental income. Primary effects are also at all transitions most strongly associated with parental education and status but in this case both parental class and parental income do retain some importance. We suggest an explanation for our empirical findings as resulting largely from the concern of highly educated, professional parents, and their children to avoid the occurrence of downward intergenerational mobility, especially in terms of education and status.",Error fetching abstract,,false,,false,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12845

Besides estimating the average treatment effect of parental unemployment on transition outcomes, we identify the economic, psychological or other intra-familial mechanisms that might explain any adverse impact of parental unemployment. Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and propensity score matching estimators we find that paternal unemployment has an adverse impact on the likelihood of entering tertiary education, whereas maternal unemployment does not. We also find that the magnitude of the effect depends on the duration of unemployment. Even though we are unable to fully account for the underlying mechanisms, our mediation analysis suggests that the effect of paternal unemployment is not due to the loss of income, but relates to the negative consequences of unemployment for intra-familial well-being and students' declining optimism about their academic prospects.",,Kristina Lindemann; M.

This paper investigates the disparities in housing careers between skilled migrants and their local counterparts in Nanjing, focusing on temporal and spatial aspects.

This approach has two potential limitations: each generation is typically divided into several equally sized income groups based on percentile ranking to create ad-hoc social classes or into predetermined broad occupational groups, and inter- and intragenerational changes in social class are not jointly analyzed. To address these limitations, we construct intergenerational income mobility tables using an alternative, group-based trajectory approach to determine the number of socioeconomic groups and characterize the development of social status over the course of individuals’ working lives. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968–2017), we show intergenerational differences in income dynamics as each generation’s life-cycle profile unfolds. Specifically, parents and offspring who, based on their average household incomes, belong to different income strata may have similar working life-course income trajectory patterns. As a result, by focusing exclusively on the average income levels, studies using income quintiles for mobility tables may underestimate intergenerational income associations.",,Xi Song; E. Zang; K.

paper considers whether the disadvantages that accrue to black Americans with a dark skin hue also induce a transition into criminal activity—an outcome consistent with standard economic models of crime. We also examine whether or not prison terms are conditioned on skin hue. With data on black offenders in the state of Mississippi, we estimate Cox proportional hazard specifications of the transition into criminal activity, and find that it is conditioned on the darkness of skin hue. Our parameter estimates are consistent with a theoretical framework in which being black and having a dark skin hue induces a transition into criminal activity by limiting the set of legitimate opportunities for an individual. Given a conviction, we also find that the severity of punishment for black offenders as measured by the length of sentence is an increasing function of the darkness of skin hue.

This paper was prepared for presentation at the Annual Meeting of the Allied Social Science Association, joint AEA/NEA paper session on “Skin Tone Discrimination and Economic Outcomes”, January 7, 2006 in Boston, Massachusetts. Conditional on being black there is evidence that skin hue matters for a wide array of socioeconomic outcomes. For example, relative to blacks with a light skin hue, there is evidence that blacks with a dark skin hue fare worse in terms of wages (Goldsmith, Hamilton and Darity, 2005), occupational prestige (Hill, 2000), unemployment ( Hunter, Allen and Telles, 2001), access to health resources (Bodenhorn, 2002), and intergenerational wealth accumulation (Bodenhorn, 2003). Such findings suggest that the distribution of advantage and disadvantage in American life is conditioned not just on being black, but given that one is black, skin hue as well. That skin hue conditions economic outcomes for blacks suggests that profit maximizing firms and utility maximizing individuals optimize across a preference for blacks with light skin hues (Goldsmith, Hamilton and Darity, 2005). If so, the distribution of disadvantage among blacks will fall along a continuum of gradations in skin hue, with disadvantage increasing with respect to the darkness of skin hue. One possible manifestation of disadvantage is crime. In the canonical economic model of crime of Becker (1968) and as extended by Ehrlich (1973), disadvantaged individuals can be viewed as those with constrained opportunities for engaging in legitimate activities, relative to illegitimate activities. To the extent that conditional on being black, opportunities for engaging in legitimate activities are inversely proportional to the darkness of skin hue, the probability of participating in illegitimate activities—crime—may also be conditioned on skin hue. Despite the apparent importance of skin hue in the distribution of advantage and disadvantage, the economics of crime literature tends to view blacks as one homogeneous group. To the extent that skin hue matters, aggregating across black Americans in this manner could lead to biased estimates of the effects of being black on participation in criminal activity, and to inferences that being black is associated with higher stocks of “criminal capital” relative to non-blacks. However, given that race and skin hue determine the distribution of disadvantage among black Americans, the effects of being black on criminal activity may instead reflect the disadvantages that accrue to being black conditional on skin hue. In this paper we consider the effects of skin hue both on the likelihood of participation in criminal activities, and on sentencing for black Americans conditional on being convicted for crime. To the extent that individuals, firms and social institutions optimize across preferences for blacks with a light skin hue, it is plausible that blacks with a dark skin hue face, relative to those with a light skin hue, constraints on opportunities for legitimate activities that motivate illegitimate activities and once arrested, are punished more severely than black offenders with a light skin hue. See for example Ehrlich (1973) and Gyimah-Brempong (1997). The only evidence that we are aware of that links skin hue among blacks with criminal justice issues is that provided by Johnson, Farrell and Stoloff (2000). They found that among black men with prior criminal records in Los Angeles, the jobless rate for those with a dark skin hue was 54 percent—in contrast to 41.7 for those with a light skin hue.","This paper considers whether the disadvantages that accrue to black Americans with a dark skin hue also induce a transition into criminal activity—an outcome consistent with standard economic models of crime.

See for example Ehrlich (1973) and Gyimah-Brempong (1997). The only evidence that we are aware of that links skin hue among blacks with criminal justice issues is that provided by Johnson, Farrell and Stoloff (2000). They found that among black men with prior criminal records in Los Angeles, the jobless rate for those with a dark skin hue was 54 percent—in contrast to 41.7 for those with a light skin hue.",K.

mixed success.Although prevalence of adult-onset diabetes is declining in some countries, the prevalence of childhood obesity and young-onset diabetes, with risk of associated complications, continues to increase in many high-and lower-income countries [1].More than 1. 9 billion children and adults are overweight and obese, and prevalence is rapidly rising, with the greatest increase found among children [2][3,4].Ongoing efforts to promote lifestyle intervention have had limited impact on the obesity and diabetes epidemic because of several critical factors.One factor comprises early life effects, a new field that has emerged surrounding developmental origins of many noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).This is the impact of nutritional and other insults during pregnancy and the first 2 years of life on the long-term risk of diabetes.Beginning with pathbreaking work by Barker on the relationship between low birth weight infants and subsequent risk of many adverse cardiometabolic outcomes [5,6], this field expanded to include multigenerational studies in animals and humans to highlight some of the potential mechanisms that may mediate the effect of fetal and infant undernutrition and related insults, including, for example, epigenetic changes affecting pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, and vasculature [7].A large number of human cohort studies have followed those exposed to nutritional and infection insults in the fetus and infancy through early adulthood and are even exploring intergenerational factors, all showing that early exposures, when interacting with obesogenic dietary and related factors, lead to much greater risks of NCDs [8][9][10].Most importantly, the increased risk of obesity and diabetes in individuals exposed in utero to undernutrition appears to be most exacerbated in those whose metabolic capacities are ""mismatched"" when exposed to metabolic challenges posed by overnutrition later in life [11,12].This pathway may be particularly relevant to lowand middle-income countries, including India and China, which have undergone rapid socioeconomic and nutritional transition, with both countries witnessing a dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes over recent decades [13].A second critical factor involves risks affecting populations of non-European origin, including Hispanic, African, Middle Eastern, or Asian groups [14][15][16][17][18].These populations appear to have greater adiposity in the visceral area; yet, at the same body mass index (BMI) as European origin adults, they have a greater likelihood of being susceptible to diabetes, which even led to many Asian countries proposing lower cutoffs for overweight and obesity [19].There is no clear explanation of the causes for these differences, although they are the subject of much",Ronald Ma and Barry Popkin discuss the urgent need and challenges to reduce intergenerational transmission of obesity and diabetes.,R.

In that period, Poland regained independence, experienced a massive loss of life in World War Two, changed borders, transited to state socialism after 1945, and finally in 1989 transited to democracy and free market economy. Therefore our study provides a good insight into the impact of structural change on intergenerational mobility.Most literature on intergenerational educational mobility investigates mobility among levels of education. However, the distribution of education levels varies over time. Therefore we use a novel empirical method developed by Asher et al. (2019). We analyse the intergenerational educational mobility at a constant rank in the distribution, not among different levels of education. Our measures of educational mobility are comparable over the measurement period and across countries. We find that intergenerational educational mobility increased after WW II. The boom of women's education was a major force behind the rise in intergenerational educational mobility in the first decades of the Polish People’s Republic. The rise in intergenerational mobility was, however, only temporary In the 1954-63 cohort the gap in educational outcomes of children of worse-off and better-off fathers has increased again. After the transition to a free market economy, intergenerational educational mobility decreased, but in the last cohort intergenerational educational mobility recovered.We compare the mobility in Recovered Territories (new regions obtained after 1945) and the rest of Poland. The society of Recovered Territories has been built of migrants from central Poland and forced migration from Kresy, which were transferred to the Soviet Union after the World War Two. The case of Recovered Territories provides a unique opportunity to study intergenerational mobility in a society, which has not existed before. We find that despite similar levels of upward mobility, the downward mobility was lower in Recovered Territories. Children of better-off fathers in Recovered Territories, to a larger extent, maintained their privileged position in the education distribution. Therefore the gap in outcomes of worse-off and better-off fathers was higher in Recovered Territories. According to our findings despite some transitionary changes the impact of parent’s education on children’s education is rather robust. This result is not surprising. Contrary to income or wealth, education cannot be taxed or redistributed. Even if the change of the system partially overturns social hierarchies, new elites usually find a way to transfer their educational advantage to children.","In this paper, we analyse intergenerational educational mobility in Poland since 1920.

Climate change poses new and dynamic challenges for infrastructural adequacy, compounding challenges of existing long-term underinvestment. In the United States, historical infrastructural choices such as redlining have substantially contributed to the structural marginalization and intergenerational wealth disparities experienced today by Black, Latinx, and other groups. This marginalization manifests in part as social vulnerability to disproportionate infrastructural and other hazards, which, without active intervention, is likely to continue to increase as climate change progresses. Adaptation to climate change will require a massive mobilization of resources for new and enhanced infrastructures. Future infrastructural investments must not repeat or mirror the unjust patterns of the past, nor facilitate their continuation through patterns such as reactive investments made based on financial value. In this commentary, we argue that the effects of climate change on future equity and resilience are particularly salient in the context of existing disparities in residential energy burden, specifically related to the way that future energy and housing system choices could worsen these disparities without explicit effort. We describe the intersection of two major anticipated climate-driven changes: (1) climate migration, which is expected to disrupt communities and change patterns of housing and energy needs; and (2) energy burden, which is expected to be exacerbated both by climate change itself (e.g., through higher temperatures) and by interactions among mitigation strategies (e.g., electrification in colder climates receiving low wealth climate migrants). Anticipating climate migration and shifting residential energy needs could facilitate a more just energy transition, focused on avoiding locking in extreme energy burdens and protecting people from extreme temperature events. Preemptive planning and targeted infrastructural investments can enable just transitions and community resilience.",,Alexandra Maxim; E. Grubert,false,,false,,https://doi.org/10.1089/env.2021.0056

It is assumed that greater productivity will result in better job performance and higher incomes. Signalling theory suggests that employers use academic credentials as a screening tool to predict the capabilities and productivity of job candidates. Although the evidence on the relative importance of signalling and human capital is inconclusive (Patrinos & Psacharopoulos, 2020), the common feature of both theories is that educational investment positively correlates with the level of labour market success (Cai, 2012). Many international education programmes have been initiated exactly based on this premise of human capital theory. Like the King Abdullah scholarship in Saudi Arabia and China's National Mobility and Elite Bachelor scholarship, Kazakhstan's Bolashak scholarship programme was designed to boost the competence of the labour force (Perna et al., 2015). However, the direct relationship between international education and better employment outcomes remains contested. Research shows that international education produces solid content knowledge (Cai, 2012; Hao et al., 2016; Pham et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020), advanced soft skills (Cai, 2012; Pham, 2020), English proficiency (Abimbola et al., 2016; Wiers- Jenssen, 2007; Wu et al., 2020) and awareness of international standards (Hao et al., 2016; Perna et al., 2015) and makes graduates more attractive to employers, increasing the odds of securing employment (Hao et al., 2016; Pham, 2020; Pham et al., 2019; Wiers- Jenssen, 2007; Wu et al., 2020). However, research also demonstrates that there is no direct link between international education and better employment outcomes. Although international education may have a ‘signalling effect’ and provide graduates with a relative advantage over others, there are other factors that impact and impede international graduates' employment.",D.

In contrast to structural change, exchange mobility highlights the linkage between one's social origins and destinations. This speaks more directly to questions of equality of educational opportunity and social fairness. Greater fairness or social progress occurs when, over time, destinations become less contingent on origins. We examine intergenerational exchange mobility in Canada by investigating how, if at all, the linkage between parents’ and their children's education has changed over the past century. We construct a longitudinal dataset covering the 20th century by merging fifteen cross‐sectional surveys from Statistics Canada's General Social Survey (GSS) between 1986 and 2014. Comparing across synthetic birth cohorts we focus on transition probabilities, odds ratios, and logistic regression estimates to measure change. We contribute to a growing gap in the Canadian literature since social mobility has been largely neglected by sociologists as of late. We compare our results to recent findings of economists who examine intergenerational income mobility, another indicator of class mobility. Consistent with earlier sociological and economic research, our results show that despite the tremendous expansion of Canada's education systems, intergenerational exchange mobility for both women and men has been stagnant in Canada over the past century.","Young adults born at the end of the 20th century attend colleges and universities at much higher rates than did previous generations, which might give the impression of greater upward educational mobility and in turn, greater class mobility.

The retiree faces an investment menu including an equity index, a risk-free bond, a life insurance and a variable annuity. I find that the added benefit of annuitization timing can be valuable for variable annuity. The utility loss due to the irreversibility of pre-annuitized wealth can be big, and a transition from the current pay-as-you-go Social Security system to a personal investmentbased system benefits retirees with high fraction of pre-annuitized wealth the most. Purchasing life insurance is effective in reducing the adverse effect of over-annuitization only for impatient retirees with low Elasticity of Intergenerational Substitution. Interestingly, the utility loss due to the irreversibility of a future life annuity purchase is small for the retiree.",Lulu Zeng,false,false,theoretical,theoretical,

residential mobility in his or her family of origin are associated with the experiences of residential mobility in adulthood. Twofamily-of-origin models are tested. The socialization model argues that children learn from their parents' mobility behaviors and replicate these behaviors in adulthood. The status-inheritance model argues that parent-adult child similarity in mobility behaviors is a result of parents and adult children sharing characteristics that are associated with mobility. Briefly, Ifind that those who moved more often as children and adolescents moved more often as adults and were more likely to move in response to several life course transitions. A good deal of parent-adult child similarity, though, is explained by the status-inheritance model. Key Words. parent-child similarity, residential mobility, socialization, status inheritance. America is a society of migration where a certain measure of mobility is required for members to obtain an education, raise families, find jobs, and realize personal goals (Gober, 1993). This viewpoint is not novel. Alexis de Tocqueville (1833-1966) noted the propensity of Americans toward high rates of internal migration. He linked high rates of mobility not to technological advances, but to values, attitudes, and the belief that economic advancement is made possible from hard work and the willingness to move in search of better opportunities. Residential mobility (hereafter mobility) is often prompted by some combination of education, employment, marital status, housing, and family characteristics and changes (Fielding, 1994; Gober, 1993; Long, 1988). When individuals make these life course decisions and subsequent mobility decisions, it is assumed that a cost-benefit analysis is undertaken that is sensitive to a mix of push-andpull factors and one's current characteristics, such as age, race, sex, tenure, presence of children, and income (DaVanzo, 1981; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1995). These models do not presume that if we equalize individual characteristics (e.g., education, marital status) we would find certain adults who are more likely to move than other adults. How does this disparity arise? I argue that mobility tendencies and behaviors are formed earlier in life while residing and moving with one's family of origin. Residential mobility as a lifestyle is transmitted from parent to child, similar to how gender, political, and religious behaviors are transmitted. This research tests two family-of-origin-mobility models that explain why some individuals are more mobile in adulthood than other individuals. The first model draws from general socialization theory and argues that offspring who experience greater instances of family mobility will move more often in adulthood. As an extension of the socialization model, offspring with extensive backgrounds of family mobility will be more likely to move after any given life course transition, compared with offspring with less extensive backgrounds of family mobility. That is, the earlier mobility experiences of certain adult offspring predispose them to view mobility as a kind of general purpose strategy. The second model draws from status-inheritance theory and argues that the mobility of adult offspring is not a function of their earlier experiences of family mobility, but is a function of other family-oforigin variables that are transmitted from parent to child. These variables are associated with both family mobility and adult mobility. A national, longitudinal, and intergenerational data set is used where measures of children's family mobility come from four parental interviews between 1980-1992. Information about adult mobility behaviors of these children come from personal interviews in 1992 and 1997. This data set is well suited to the current research goals. The average age of the adult children was 23 years in 1992. So examining mobility behaviors between 1992-1997 is timely because most of these individuals will be making life course transitions that are often accompanied by a move. …","I examine how an individual's earlier experiences of residential mobility in his or her family of origin are associated with the experiences of residential mobility in adulthood.

and a regional overlapping generations model calibrated on Canadian data to evaluate the potential economic-welfare and intergenerational equity implications of increasing the number of immigrants on national and regional labour markets, real per-capita income and wages. The simulations are performed according to alternative scenarios of regional residential location decision of immigrants in Canada. Among the key findings, the simulations indicate that increasing the number of immigrants to achievable targets may ease to a certain extent the anticipated decline in national savings and real per-capita income in the long run and partly accommodate future young generations. However, these benefits will take several decades to materialize. They also suggest that immigrant's regional location decisions may have important consequences on regional labour markets and regional income disparity in the future. Introduction The population in Canada and other industrialised countries is ageing and consequently the ratio of elderly to the working-age population (ratio of 65+ to the 15-64 population) is expected to increase dramatically over the next several decades. (1) The trend in retirement decision also indicates that older Canadian workers retire earlier than in previous decades. (2) A direct consequence of ageing population is that the transition of the baby-boom generation from work to retirement is expected to lead to job opportunities in all major occupational groups. In particular, some occupations/sectors where workers are generally older or tend to retire earlier may be more affected (e.g. Social Science, Health and Primary Industries). (3) This in turn could result in a relative scarcity of workers and the trend towards early retirement could intensify the situation. According to the conventional view, the transition of baby-boomers from work-to-retirement could also potentially have important perverse socio-economic effects in the future, such as a decline in national savings and in real per-capita income. (4) It could also put increased pressures on the cost of public pensions and health care, and have negative intergenerational equity implications. However, the relative scarcity of workers is likely to result in increases in real wages, which would provide some compensating effects to workers. A wide range of policies can be considered to help accommodate some of the consequences of ageing. In this respect, the Canadian government has already taken steps forward by reforming the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans (CPP/ QPP) and by adopting a strategy of gradual reduction in the ratio of public debt-to-GDP. Another key policy instrument is Canada's immigration, which reflects a range of socio-economic objectives including economic growth, family reunification and humanitarian objectives. In this respect, in comparison to other industrialised countries, Canada has one of the highest inflows of immigrants relative to its population. In fact, without the contribution of immigration, both the population and the labour force would eventually decline in the future. Since the annual flow and the skill composition of new immigrants to Canada is an important factor of labour force growth, there is no doubt that current immigration trends contribute to enhancing the balance between the working-age population and retired people. It is, however, more difficult to quantify the economic-welfare gains associated with immigration and to evaluate the additional gain that would be associated with an increase in the number of new immigrants. Another important factor to consider when we look at migration flows is the residential location decision of new immigrants, given the potential implications on regional disparity. In fact, according to the stylised facts, recent trends in new immigrant's residential location indicate that a large proportion of them choose to live in central Canada (province of Ontario) in much greater proportions than the province's share of the Canadian population. …",,,false,,false,,

The calibrated model successfully accounts for untargeted distributional aspects of income mobility, which are captured in the income quintile transition matrix. Counterfactual exercises show that removing heterogeneity in parental time investment reduces intergenerational persistence by around 7-8% for early childhood but only marginally in later childhood. Since parental time and monetary investments are poor substitutes for human capital development in early childhood, parental time investment during this period serves as a mechanism that amplifies the transmission of the parents' economic status to their children. Policy experiments find that an asset-tested subsidy for parental monetary investments in early childhood can raise intergenerational mobility in a cost-effective way, though it reduces mobility substantially if given to parents with older school-aged children.","This paper investigates parental time investment in children prior to formal schooling as a source of intergenerational income persistence in the U.S. I develop a dynamic general equilibrium model where lifetime income endogenously persists across generations through multiple channels. My model replicates a series of important untargeted aspects of the data including the 
U.S. income quintile transition matrix. I find that the parental time investment channel accounts for nearly 40 percent of the observed intergenerational income persistence. Policy experiments suggest that e¤ective ways of improving mobility should focus on narrowing discrepancies in the quantity and quality of parental time investments.",Minchul Yum,theoretical,theoretical,theoretical,theoretical,https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/62620/1/Int%20Economic%20Review%20-%202022%20-%20Yum%20-%20PARENTAL%20TIME%20INVESTMENT%20AND%20INTERGENERATIONAL%20MOBILITY.pdf

Theories of the health implications of social mobility draw on the human perception of one's changing conditions, but empirical studies mostly examine the health implications of moving from objectively defined indicators of parental socio-economic position such as education, occupation, or income, to own socio-economic position in adult life. Little is known about the consequences of individuals' own assessment of changes in socio-economic position for health outcomes. In this study, we examine the association of social mobility and health in a unique sample of the Russian population after the transition to a market society. We take a broad perspective on social mobility, putting emphasis on subjectively perceived social mobility. Results show that individuals' objective characteristics only partially explain the variation in their subjective perceptions of intergenerational mobility. Net of social origin and destination variables, subjective social mobility is associated with individuals' health outcomes, as measured by the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Those who perceive being upwardly mobile report better health, and downward mobility is associated with poorer health. The association holds for mental and physical health, for perceived downward and upward social mobility, and for a general subjective measure of mobility and a subjective measure prompting respondents to only think of mobility in terms of occupation. These findings are robust to controlling for a rich set of socio-demographic predictors on childhood adversity, contemporaneous material wellbeing, and family-related circumstances. We conclude that a conventional focus on single socio-economic status dimensions such as occupation might be too narrow to capture the health consequences of social mobility.",,A. Gugushvili; P.

In the current climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, high and low income households but also developed and underdeveloped countries as well as various overlapping generations are affected differently. This paper proposes to map international climate change mitigation and adaptation regimes in order to derive fair climate stability implementation strategies. Based on insights on the current endeavor to finance climate change mitigation and adaptation around the globe, a 3-dimensional climate justice approach will be introduced to share the burden of climate change within society in a fair way. First, climate justice within a country should pay tribute to the fact that low- and high income households share the same burden proportional to their dispensable income, for instance enabled through a progressive carbon taxation. Those who caused climate change could be regulated to bear a higher cost through carbon tax in combination with retroactive billing through inheritance tax. Secondly, fair climate change burden sharing between countries comprises of argumentations that those countries benefiting more from a stable climate, hence those with a larger landscape or higher population, who have more access to climate than others, should also bear a higher burden of climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Countries that reap benefit from a warming earth should be obliged to finance international aid for those who are impacted negatively by climate change, e.g., climate refugees. In addition, building on case and international law, those countries that have better means of protection or conservation of the common climate should also face a greater responsibility to protect the earth. Thirdly, climate justice over time is proposed in an innovative climate change burden sharing strategy. Innovative compensation schemes to share the burden of climate change with bonds help weight the burden of climate change more equally between today’s and tomorrow’s society. A climate tax and bonds mix could subsidize the current world industry for transitioning to green solutions and future generations, who will enjoy a less carbon intensive industry and more stable climate but should repay those bonds. Thereby the current generation is advised to mitigate climate change financed through bonds to remain financially as well off as without mitigation while improving environmental well-being of future generations. This respective intergenerational tax-and-transfer policy-mix could turn climate change mitigation into a Pareto-improving strategy. All these efforts should alleviate the contemporary global governance predicament that seems to pit today’s generation against future world inhabitants in a trade-off of economic growth versus sustainability. Deriving respective policy recommendations for the wider climate change community is aimed at ensuring to share the burden but also the benefits of climate change within society, between countries and over time in an economically efficient and legally equitable way.","A three-dimensional climate justice approach introduces to share the benefits and burden of climate change in an economically efficient, legally equitable, and practically feasible way around the globe.

We extend these existing studies by estimating the effect of financial transfers on the probability of becoming an owner as well as the role of in‐kind transfers. We also analyse how the impacts of different intergenerational transmission channels vary across neighbourhoods of advantage and disadvantage and discuss the implications for inequality in access to ownership. Drawing on a large panel data set from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, we offer three new findings. First, we show that financial transfers made concurrently with home purchases play a more important role than lagged transfers and that in‐kind transfers are also an important part of the process of gaining ownership. Second, we note that in‐kind transfers are more effective for raising home ownership prospects in areas with high socioeconomic status, while financial transfers appear to be more effective in middle‐class neighbourhoods. Third, children from disadvantaged backgrounds are least likely to be assisted into home ownership by intergenerational transfers.",,Rachel Ong ViforJ; W.

The major hypotheses set forth are: 1) the effect of income on fertility depends on the source and timing of income; 2) in a lifetime context, parents, or would-be parents, who have higher incomes at young ages compared with the income they anticipate at old age, are expected to have a higher demand for children; and 3) the reverse of the latter is predicted for parents who anticipate relatively higher incomes at old age. These hypotheses follow the idea that, in the absence of other appropriate means for intertemporal transfers of wealth, parents even out the lifetime welfare through fertility behavior. Under these circumstances, fertility rates are expected to increase in communities where children abandon their traditional commitments to their aging parents, as may happen during periods of economic and cultural transition. A decline in mortality rates will induce lower fertility. This model suggests that a tax-financed social security scheme along with family planning will be conducive to a reduction in fertility. A test on data from an Indian village in 1968-69 suggests that in a traditional setting there is a correlation between household welfare, measured by income or assets, and the presence of grown children. Income has a positive effect on fertility when the parents' incomes comes from labor rather than human and nonhuman capital which provides income at later stages of life. Longitudinal data depicting income, savings, and fertility patterns over time should prove more promising in exploring the issues discussed.",,,false,,false,,

increasingly important for retirement and pensions as recent reforms have strengthened the link between lifetime employment and benefits, introduced measures to lengthen working lives and increased the role of private supplementary pensions. At the same time, life courses are increasingly fragmented due to diversified and discontinuous employment, family dynamics and migration. These developments raise concerns about the adequacy of pensions as well as socioeconomic and gender inequalities in old-age income, not only for current but also for future retirees. This Special Issue focuses on inequalities in pensions and retirement from a life course and intergenerational perspective. The interrelation of individuals' life courses and pension systems is essential for understanding the living conditions and financial well-being of older individuals. Pension benefits are the main income source of retirees in mature welfare states. While there is some variation in the degree of privatization of pension systems as well as in the relevance of occupational pension plans, statutory systems remain the main provider of income for the current generation of retirees in OECD countries (OECD, 2019). Therefore, governmental decisions on the design of pension systems directly impact the living standard of current and future elderly. In the pension systems of developed welfare states, the level of pension benefits is mostly in some way linked to the previous employment history and/or other aspects of the individual life course. However, variation exists in how this link between old-age benefits and previous life courses is designed. Two basic options can be differentiated. According to the Bismarckian social insurance principle, pension benefits are based on contributions during working life and are thereby strongly linked to previous earnings. In contrast, Beveridge-style basic pensions are more-or-less independent from achievements during working life and provide a certain minimum standard of living for every pensioner. In most countries, pension systems are de facto a mix of both ideal types (Hinrichs & Lynch, 2010; Kuitto & Kuivalainen, 2020). Pension systems also differ with respect to the relevance of private provision which also relies on deposits during working life or, in the case of occupational pensions, is restricted to specific employees and requires steady careers. Therefore, the link between life course and later life income is the stronger the more pronounced the Bismarckian elements are and the more privatized a pension system is. Social policies, as especially the pension system, operate on basis of an institutionalized ""normal life course"" which defines what is ""standard"" and what as ""atypical"" in terms of calculating and granting benefits (Kohli, 1985; Leisering, 2003). This ""normal life course"" is in many societies highly gendered as it is oriented upon a male-dominated biography of continuous full-time employment. Accordingly, eligibility criteria and level of public pension receipt are usually linked to paid employment, while informal care work or periods of unemployment are much less or not at all considered in some countries (Leitner, 2001). In the shift from industrial to service society, however, this normative orientation on continuous standard employment faces turmoil. As challenges arise from rising global competition, digitalization and automatization and volatile work histories, precarious and non-standard employment have become increasingly frequent for larger parts of the working population and are no longer a phenomenon solely restricted to women with care responsibilities (Buchholz et al., 2009). The relationship of life courses and pension systems has been in the spotlight of empirical sociological and social policy research for a long time. This is because the relationship is of relevance for researchers from different areas: sociologists focus more on micro-level relationships within individuals' life courses while social policy and political science researchers examine how pension systems impact social inequality from a macro perspective. With respect to the first line of research, country-specific and comparative studies examine life course determinants of income and living standard of the current generation of elderly. Previous studies in this tradition reveal among others that atypical work histories and family trajectories seem detrimental with regard to household income of older men and women. However, for older women's personal incomes, long-term marriages are rather unfavourable (e.g., Fasang, Aisenbrey, & Schomann, 2013; Sefton, Evandrou, Falkingham, & Vlachantoni, 2011). The welfare state is an important mechanism of stratification for old-age incomes (Dewilde, 2012). When accounting for life course factors, pension system characteristics prove to be especially relevant for women's old-age income and reproduce inequality (Möhring, 2015). Most studies in this line of research include older birth cohorts that have entered retirement already in the 2000s and, therefore, can only give clues about the situation of future retirees. One of the few studies delivering a more prospective picture by Meyer, Bridgen, and Riedmüller (2007) uses hypothetical ""risk biographies"" to examine likely distributional outcomes of pension system privatization on the financial resources of the elderly. The other line of research that this Special Issue addresses are macro level studies on the relationship of pension systems, pension reforms and well-being in old age. Previous research in this field focuses on the effects of pension reforms on old-age poverty and inequality (e.g., Grech, 2015; Zaidi et al., 2006). In particular, the privatization of pensions is seen as accelerating old-age poverty and income inequalities of retirees (e.g., Anderson 2019; Been, Caminada, Goudsward, & van Vliet, 2017; Ebbinghaus, 2011). Further studies analyse how pension system characteristics reproduce or cushion gender differences in pensions (e.g., Betti et al. 2015; Leitner, 2001) or facilitate later retirement (e.g., Ebbinghaus, 2006; Ebbinghaus & Hofäcker, 2013). Despite the broad range of previous research in the field, some important blind spots remain. This applies especially to the consequences of atypical life courses for well-being in later life. For example, how do unemployment and low pay impact old-age income and wealth? Does divorce or single parenthood always translate in a higher old-age poverty risk? What are the consequences of informal caregiving for example for children or fragile family members for the caregiver's pension income? These gaps partly emerge from data restrictions in empirical studies: as we are unable to observe complete life histories for younger cohorts, we are also unable to address these questions empirically. Nevertheless, as social and economic change modifies individuals' work histories in the direction of greater volatility and a higher prevalence of atypical employment, it remains important for social scientists to address these questions – both from a micro level as well as a policy perspective. Standard employment and marital biographies that were the default assumptions underlying most of the pension systems at their outset are increasingly vanishing. Employment histories become more de-standardized in the transition from industrial to service society and are moving away from the lifelong standard employment relationship in favour of fixed-term contracts and volatile careers. Because life expectancy increases, older people need more care which, in turn, is often divided unequally between men and women. With increasing international mobility and migration, a rising number of people also accrue their pension rights in more than one pension system, and migrants often have weaker labour market positions compared to the non-migrant population (Bridgen, Meyer & Davison, 2021; Heisig, Lancee & Radl, 2018). Lastly, we are just at the brink of seeing the consequences of a long-term dismantling of public pension systems within the OECD as, in most countries, this will not affect current retirees. Despite the societal and political relevance of the topic, comparative research on the linkage between life course dynamics and pension systems affecting retirement and old-age income is surprisingly scarce. A comparative perspective provides several important advantages that enable a better understanding of both the effects of recent pension reforms and trends in life courses for inequalities in old age. First, there is considerable institutional variation across countries with respect to pension systems providing old-age income, but also in terms of other institutions supporting labour market participation and providing social security and services throughout the life course. In part, recent reforms have also taken different paths. A comparative approach accounting for this variation helps in assessing the effects of institutions with differing design and their change on pension adequacy and retirement transitions. Second, countries also vary considerably regarding gender division in labour markets, care and incomes. This is reflected in a substantial gender gap in pensions in nearly all countries. A comparative perspective may reveal both institutional and societal factors that promote gender equality in old age. Third, a comparative perspective is also needed to assess how successfully the goals set by the European Union and promoted by other international organizations such as the OECD regarding pension adequacy, lengthening working lives and reducing the gender pension gap have been reached (European Commission, 2018; OECD, 2019). While monitoring trends using microdata is widely utilized by the EU and the OECD, comparative research offers more profound knowledge on the impacts of reforms. Lastly, comparative analysis provides methodologically more reliable ways of detecting causal relationships and covariance between pension system features, life course factors and inequalities in pension income and retirement. The contributions of this Special Issue provide topical and important insights based on empirical cross-national comparative analyses and this way, contribute to the closing of the gaps described above. The first set of articles focuses on recent trends in pension system reforms and their main goals in affluent welfare states and points to inequalities in old age that follow from these. Two developments in particular seem crucial. First, the increasing role of private pension provision, together with cuts in public pensions, endangers the positive trend of decreasing old-age poverty of past decades. Many people with low or even average incomes are not able to make private pension savings that would accumulate adequate income in old age. Simultaneous cuts in the level public pensions tend then to harm low-to-middle income pensioners the most, increasing inequalities in old age income and well-being. Second, because of recent reforms, full and adequate pensions are increasingly dependent on longer working lives and pensions accruing from earnings throughout the life course instead of from the end part of the career. However, not everyone is capable for working longer for example because of sickness, disability or persistent unemployment, and fragile working careers with disruptions are becoming more common. This, again, further weakens the adequacy of old age income especially for those with non-standard and/or low-income careers and generates further inequalities not only in old age financial well-being, but also in the timing and voluntariness of retirement. Old-age income and retirement, therefore, in general, reflect inequalities that occur throughout the life course stronger than before. The second set of articles focuses on inequalities in late careers, retirement and old-age income that are shaped by non-standardization of life courses. The articles provide new empirical insights into how working lives and family patterns have become more de-standardized and fragmented, or how an increasing need for elderly care might reinforce gender and social inequalities in retirement and pensions. Lastly, this Special Issue also focuses on the challenge of intergenerational inequality that gains in importance with demographic ageing. By applying a comparative perspective on public support for pro-old policies, the final article of the collection points to the importance of perceived inequalities between generations for the legitimacy of future pension reforms. The first article by Karl Hinrichs studies pension reforms carried out in EU countries over the last 30 years. Most of the reforms have aimed at strengthening long-term financial sustainability. Cost-containing measures have often meant lower adequacy and tighter conditions, which have brought along an increased risk of old-age poverty. The tightened contribution-benefit ratio will affect future generations of pensioners, particularly those with an atypical employment career. Hinrichs argues that, in view of changing life courses and growing inequality, preserving an effective instrument for poverty alleviation in old age becomes more important than before. The second article by Bernhard Ebbinghaus takes a closer look at the increasingly important topic of retirement income adequacy. A comparative analysis of poverty rates and income inequality in old age reveals that substantial poverty and income inequality in old age still exist across Europe, albeit with wide cross-national variation. Minimum income provision of public pension systems contributes the most to poverty risks, while the overall pension architecture impacts on how inequality acquired during working life is reproduced in old age. In line with Hinrichs, Ebbinghaus argues that the role of non-contributory pensions will increase, given that employment careers are becoming less standardized. Recent reforms have aimed at extending working lives and increasing the effective retirement age. The article by Kati Kuitto and Jan Helmdag investigates how policies have shaped retirement and labour market participation of older workers in OECD countries over two decades. Pension system amendments have postponed retirement in many countries, but social policies supporting labour market participation throughout the life course that are often referred to as social investment policies have been correspondingly important for extending working lives. However, the authors note that policies to extend working lives bear the danger of rising inequality. Adequate pension provision is widely achieved only if the extension of working lives becomes a reality for most people. Non-standard work and fragmented family histories are more common today than ever. National pension systems recognize these risks to varying degrees. This is the topic of the article by Katja Möhring, using life history data for 12 European countries. Some characteristics (e.g., single parenthood and low-status employment) represent a general old-age income risk, while others (e.g., female part-time employment) are more dependent on the national context. A redistributive design of the pension system is the best way to balance differences in employment participation and working forms over the life course. If working careers and family lives remain fragmented, the need for redistributive measures will increase in the future. In their article, Ariane Bertogg, Tiziana Nazio and Susanne Strauss investigate the effects of informal caregiving on men's and women's decision to retire or to reduce their working hours. Upward caregiving to parents is less relevant in this respect than lateral care (e.g., to siblings) and downward care (to grandchildren). The welfare model moderates the impact of caregiving on labour market participation. Similar to the conclusions by Kuitto and Helmdag, the results presented in this article highlight the importance of adapting holistic policy measures in prolonging working lives. Generational fairness has gained a great deal of attention in recent years. The sixth and last article by Aart-Jan Riekhoff relates to the generational welfare contract and provides new comparative insight into how pension reforms relate to policy preferences of different cohorts when it comes to welfare support for old people and support for the working population and families with children. Support for pro-old welfare policies has declined particularly in countries that have introduced a greater number of pension reforms. Nonetheless, the generational welfare contract remains strong. Riekhoff's article conveys an essential message for policy makers: the sustainability of the pension system does not only depend on financial possibilities but also on the willingness of subsequent generations to retain it. All six articles in this Special Issue point to the importance of institutional factors that arise from pension system design and reforms over time. Altogether, they contribute to a better understanding of the challenges of pension adequacy and related inequalities in contemporary welfare states and how pension policies shape them. In addition, the articles point to the importance of future research. One of the topics in need of further study is pension privatization, particularly its (re-)distributional effects and its effects on public support. Furthermore, the interdependence of social policy and labour market institutions calls for more empirical research, especially in times of changing and diverging labour markets as well as labour mobility. Adequate pension provision of migrants is one example of yet less studied areas that need more specific attention. Lastly, all articles point to the persistence or even increase of the gender gap in old-age incomes and retirement, underlining the need for further research on the ways in which policies can help reduce gender inequality in old age.","Life course trajectories have become increasingly important for retirement and pensions as recent reforms have strengthened the link between lifetime employment and benefits, introduced measures to lengthen working lives and increased the role of private supplementary pensions.

Organizational ethics revolves around written and/or unwritten guidelines, ethical values, principles, rules and standards, that are drawn from the harmonious coexistence with the biosphere and it is how these elements are applied that dictates the style of leadership and the ethical thinking of the leaders. Africa has a wide range of complexities which are compounded by, inter alia, tribal divisiveness, selfish leadership, wealth inequality, and massive unemployment. Africans tend to draw their leadership and ethical practices and reflections from the events in the environment with which they have interacted for many years. However, in order to fully address and understand the African perspective in leadership and organizational ethics, a broad comprehension of the African diverse and complex landscape is needed through unravelling of the three dimensional existence of the people. African ethics, developed over time, unifies organizations and leadership since it is part of life and is practised, sub-consciously or unconsciously, by the people as they transform from one practice to the other, and during intergenerational transitions. Globalization, liberalization, technological changes and advancement, and market changes are rapidly transforming the environment in which organizations operate. In such a situation, an effective and true leader cannot be rigid but should be flexible, with the ability to use different leadership styles whenever the situation calls for it. Only those leaders with a three-dimensional perspective live inspiring lives, live with a cause and adopt organizational ethics and leadership styles that will stand the test of time. Despite Africa being the cradle of humankind, leadership and organizational ethics is still in its infancy and wanting, even with the new generation of young leaders.

Purpose
A few studies in India have related daughters’ education to their fathers, but there is little to no evidence when it comes to the intergenerational relation between daughters and mothers’ education. Using India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2011–2012, the purpose of this paper is to investigate intergenerational educational mobility among women (15–49 years) (vis-à-vis their mothers) for all India.


Design/methodology/approach
The study uses transition/mobility matrices and multiple mobility measures for the examination of intergenerational educational mobility among women (15–49 years) in India. The data have been taken from the “India Human Development Survey 2011-12.”


Findings
Findings indicate that intergenerational educational mobility at the all-India level is about 0.69, that is, 69 percent of the women acquire a level of education different from their mothers. Of the overall mobility, about 80 percent is contributed by upward mobility whereas the rest is downward. Mobility is greater in urban areas and is highest among the socially advantaged “Others” (or upper) caste group. Also, the upward component is substantially lower for socially disadvantaged groups compared to others. Further, there are large inter-regional variations, with the situation being worst in the central and eastern states such as Uttaranchal, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, etc. Moreover, mobility (overall and upward) increases consistently as one moves up the income distribution.


Originality/value
This study is perhaps the first study which comprehensively studies intergenerational educational mobility for women (15–49 years) at an all-India level. Findings not only capture the mobility at the aggregate level but also for different caste groups as well as regional variations and income effect.

This dyadic relationship may be subject to the constraining effects of responsibilities associated with mid-life, and the increasingly complex process associated with youth transition to adulthood, suggesting the potential for weakened intergenerational bonds of co-residence and communication. Empirical analysis, using multivariate logistic regression techniques draws on data from a 1997 New Zealand sample survey examining intergenerational relations between individuals aged 40-54 and their children and ageing parents. Results indicate that marital status, gender, religion and ethnicity exert a particular influence on both dimensions of solidarity, and that the potentially constraining factors of household income, employment, family size and the presence of ageing parents do not appear to weaken them unduly. Results do suggest that both dimensions of solidarity are weakened by parental divorce and separation, but remain the strongest when children share a biological link with parents.","Family theorists in the early to mid- twentieth century argued that as a result of industrialisation, occupational specialisation and urbanisation, the family was being depleted of its functions, devolving them in part to other institutions (Parsons and Bales, 1956). Support provided through informal, extended family networks had been eroded, reinforcing the dependency of the family upon other social institutions (Goode, 1963). Moreover, intergenerational kin relationships were to have weakened, leading to the erosion of the foundations of family solidarity (Ogburn, 1938). More recently, others have argued that the family has in fact preserved its functions and interactions with broader kinship networks, as well as between and across generations (Rossi and Rossi, 1990; Pitrou, 1992). Under the influence of reforms which have challenged public commitment to collective welfare provisions, coupled with micro-level processes of family change such as divorce, it is argued that new forms of generational solidarity have emerged (Bengtson, 2001; BawinLegros, 1996).But a relatively recent challenge to the thesis of the endurance of intergenerational bonds has come from those concerned that demographic changes, notably decreases in family size, shifts in the timing of births, improved life expectancies and increasing marital dissolution may alter the structure of these relationships, bringing about a redistribution of age-related roles across the life course (Lauterbach and Klein, 2004). The mid-life phase has become the focus of these concerns because it is a period of the life course during which adults are expected to be increasingly faced by multiple roles as they respond to the needs of ascending and descending kin members, as well as dealing with broader workplace or community commitments. The mid-life period therefore becomes cast as one of potentially stressful and conflict-ridden intergenerational relations (Agree, et al, 2003; Brody, 1990).Today, these concerns find resonance in New Zealand. Historically, emphasis has always been placed on the family as the front line source of support for its members, but more recently, there has been an increasing assumption that the costs involved in young people's transitions to adulthood will be absorbed at the micro-level of family relations (McPherson, 2000). This assumption is reflected for example, in policy reforms making student allowances means-tested based on parental income until children reach their mid twenties. The mid-life period is also becoming more of a focus because it is seen as a time of complex relationships and responsibilities (Koopman-Boyden, et al., 2000). Women are increasingly involved in paid work, a change that has been particularly marked since the 1980s for those aged in their forties and early fifties, and they are still more likely than men to care for the ill or disabled in their home, and to be involved in unpaid voluntary work beyond their household (Davey, 2003:118). Those aged in the mid-life period are also now spending more time in tertiary or higher education, and women aged in their early forties have shown increased fertility over the past ten years (Davey, 2003:111,105). There are then, indications of an increasing diversity in the roles and responsibilities that the mid-life period will carry with it in New Zealand.From the young adult's perspective, there is an awareness in New Zealand that their transitions to adulthood are becoming more complex, due to economic and policy-driven changes which carry implications about expected ages of financial and residential independence (Statistics New Zealand, 1998; Bird and Drewery, 2000). Tightened eligibility for income support based on age, the introduction of a student loan scheme in 1992 and the increasing financial debts that this has incurred particularly for those in the 18-24 age groups, draw attention to the need to evaluate how the timing of early adult life-course decisions concerning home leaving, completing education, searching for employment, beginning a family or house purchasing may be changing (Higgins, 2002; Ministry of Education, 2003). …",S.

widely throughout the world, though everywhere its social relevance has grown substantially in recent decades. This living arrangement, more widespread among women than men aged over 65, is one of the most visible characteristics of societal aging currently underway. Explaining residential options among older persons and the different strategies implemented in societies of diverse cultural and historical traditions with different levels of development has important implications for our understanding and management of aging. Most of the research on this subject has concentrated on the developed world because it is there that levels of single living during later life tend to be highest as a result of the decline of intergenerational coresidence and the increase of solitary living among elderly people (Alter, Cliggett, and Urbiel 1996; Andorka 1995; Fauve-Chamoix 1996; Guinnane 1996; Pampel 1992; Ruggles 2001, 2007; Tomassini et al. 2004; Wall 1995). Less attention has been paid to the developing world owing to a lack of adequate data and lower levels of living alone. The result has been the absence of a global comparative perspective. While our goal here is not to explain all the variety in the world, we believe that a global viewpoint is essential, even if only as a starting point for the much-needed and more specific questions that will be the focus of future research on the subject. Given the potential importance for the health and wellbeing of the elderly of this particular living arrangement, its relevance for policy and for society is evident everywhere. We examine living alone among the elderly based on a large set of countries covering much of the world. The point of departure is the pioneering UN report on the subject (United Nations 2005) that was based on data taken mostly from the 1990s and made use of a number of earlier studies (Bongaarts and Zimmer 2002; Palloni 2001; Wolf 1995). Unlike this original study, our approach is based on more recent data (2010–11) and makes much more intensive use of micro census data. The heterogeneous nature of societies throughout the world makes a comparative viewpoint essential for understanding living arrangements among the elderly. Undertaking comparative empirical analysis, however, is not a straightforward task. The living arrangements of the elderly, and more specifically living alone, are the result of the preferences and resources people have, together with the constraints they face as they age. They reflect material conditions, health realities, the support they can expect to receive from their families, communities, and societies, and the extent to which they are willing or determined to live alone during the final stages of their lives. These preferences are generated within the context of prevailing cultural norms. In the developed world, this is always viewed as preference or choice, but it is still a part of prevailing norms. That is why behavior can be so different between those developed countries characterized by individualistic societies with sufficient material resources to realize preferences, and those developed countries characterized by familistic societies with few resources to implement alternative solutions. All of this takes place during a period of people's lives in which health conditions can change radically, making any general consideration of people above age 60 as elderly a misleading simplification. At least in the developed world, people entering this age group are likely to be in good health, continue to earn top-level salaries within their chosen professions, frequently prolong their working lives and even work after retirement, and are able to make significant material contributions to the wellbeing of their families. While the extent to which the situation is similar in the developing world is unknown, it is unquestionable that the health of older persons in their 60s will normally be much better than later in life. At some point in both developed and developing countries, failing health, disability, chronic illness, and decreasing personal autonomy will become more prominent. Thus, at the outset of old age, residential decisions appear to be determined overwhelmingly by personal preferences and expectations, while toward the end of life decisions are often made by others. The role of society in these decisions, expectations, and options is often decisive. Prevailing family systems (Goode 1963; Goody 1976, 1996; Hajnal 1982) and the extent to which non-family options for aging, normally related to policy and to publicly organized support and care (Shenfield 1957), are the key factors. They represent the two main options for managing the process of aging satisfactorily and are often, though frequently incorrectly, seen as mutually exclusive (Blome, Keck, and Alber 2009; Folbre and Wolf 2012; Kohli 1999; Motel-Klingebiel, Tesch-Roemer, and Von Kondratowitz 2005; Saraceno 2008). Family systems are important both because they are a key source of values and preferences in society and because of the willingness and ability of the family to provide the care needed by members as they age. Values are important because they guide people's expectations and behavior. In societies where family systems are strong and pervasive, people will perceive their own old age as tied to their families, who are the source of aid and of happiness. Where family systems are weaker, the value given to individualism and individual initiative will be greater, and this will lead to different strategies and realities when confronting personal aging (Reher 1998). Other things being equal, living alone will always be more prevalent in societies where individual values pertain and lower where they do not (Padyab et al. 2018). Early in the process of aging, even people living alone may perceive the family and family contact as a key part of the quality of their lives. When the progressive loss of personal autonomy sets in, they will expect their families to broker key decisions and to provide them with aid, often by means of coresidence with kin. Policy-based responses to aging are the other great force influencing the residential choices of the elderly. These responses are numerous, ranging from public pension systems and health care to institutions and instruments designed to provide the care needed to help people reach the end of their lives as comfortably as possible (Daly 2010; Steckenrider and Parrott 1998).1 Taken together they comprise the backbone of the welfare state wherever it exists. In historical terms, the welfare state is a relatively recent phenomenon, dating from the late nineteenth and especially the twentieth century. In many ways, the growth of these systems was an attempt to remove the role of care from the sphere of the family and transfer it to the public domain (Esping-Andersen 1999). It was part of the effort of the modernizing state to become the preeminent force in people's lives. The stronger the state's role, the smaller that played by the family both for expectations regarding care and care actually provided for the elderly. Because of the close link between modernization and economic development, it is not surprising that indicators of wealth and development tend to be positively linked with living alone and negatively linked with all forms of familial intervention.2 While some analysts see an inevitable pattern at work whereby familial interventions will eventually be replaced everywhere by policy-based responses to aging, in fact there are all kinds of patterns and combinations in existence throughout the world (Padyab et al. 2018). Any wide selection of countries will include some where there is little or no public intervention in later life and others where state-based interventions are paramount. Ultimately the process of societal aging will increase pressure everywhere, but it is likely to have a more negative effect on family-based interventions than on public ones (De Santis 2012). The family is poorly designed to confront the type of challenge posed by rapidly changing age structures and societal aging, and the resources it is able to marshal will be hard put to meet the realities of what has been called the “beanpole family” (whose living members come from several generations, but with few members in each generation) characteristic of modern life. At an individual level, there are other factors at work, some affecting the likelihood of being in a position to live alone and others affecting transitions out of single living into other forms of coresidence, whether institutional or not. Some of these factors influence the choices people make, while others affect the ways in which these preferences are shaped by forces beyond their control. Pertinent literature on household formation, based for the most part on the developed world, considers living arrangements as a means for achieving several domestic goods—privacy, companionship, domestic services, personal care, and consumption economies of scale, among others—whose specific combination is subject to the tradeoffs confronted by individuals when deciding with whom to live (Burch and Matthews 1987). Preferences related to these goods, their relative economic and social-psychological costs, and resources available to obtain them will determine the particular living arrangement chosen by individuals. With respect to the elderly, it has been suggested that the demand for these domestic goods depends on preferences for individual autonomy and privacy (Wister and Burch 1989; Palloni 2001), income levels (Michael, Fuchs, and Scott 1980; Macunovich et al. 1995; Wolf 1995), and the availability of kin (Bachrach 1980; Chevan and Korson 1975; Kobrin 1976; Pampel 1983; Soldo 1981; Wolf 1994). Since kin availability mainly refers to spouses and children, trends and patterns in marriage, divorce, and fertility constrain the stock of proximate kin available for potential coresidence and become factors relevant to explaining the phenomenon of living alone among the elderly. Several factors influencing choice come into play. Differences by sex in life expectancy among the elderly help explain the fact that in most societies, living alone is far more frequent among women than among men, leading to elderly populations filled with widows (Wolf and Soldo 1988). This is most clear in societies with reduced levels of mortality, where differences by sex in life expectancy are largest.3 Divorce is another important factor in the dissolution of unions whose frequency tends to vary sharply by levels of development and by cultural, religious, and legal contexts. These factors do not always operate in the same direction.4 It is also known that the more highly educated are the most likely to live alone. This may be because more highly educated people tend to have more material resources and may also have higher divorce rates. Yet a greater willingness to live alone among the more highly educated cannot be discarded either. In families prone to higher mortality or in those with very low fertility, the options to reside with kin will be more limited than in large families with many children (Kobrin 1976; Pampel 1983; Wister and Burch 1983; Wolf 1995; Iacovou 2000; Gaymu et al. 2006; Koropeckyj-Cox and Call 2007; Reher and Requena 2017). The supply of available kin, important as it is, may have little to do with the willingness of the family group to assume this role or with people's expectations. Income (Macunovich et al. 1995; Pampel 1992) and, particularly, people's ability to save for retirement or the existence of public pensions (McGarry and Schoeni 2000) can also influence their ability to avoid depending on others for support, especially during the first phase of old age. Later, however, matters related to health become paramount for this type of choice. There is a vast literature linking health in later life—and in particular chronic disease—with numerous socioeconomic characteristics (education, healthy and active lives, etc.), though reliable estimates of the timing of changes in health are generally beyond the control or the strategies of individuals. Once decline sets in, however, a person's material wellbeing will have much to do with the type of options he (or his kin) have available when making the key decisions for this stage of life. A number of these points are useful for understanding how the incidence of living alone changes as people age. When people are in the early stages of later life, the likelihood of living alone should increase, but after a certain age these increases will cease and declines will become the norm. The most evident reasons for these contrary trends are related to the important weight of spousal deaths—especially of men—together with divorce and relatively good health among the young elderly. All of these factors will contribute to the growing number of persons, especially women, living alone. As people grow older, however, the weight of failing health becomes the key factor as people are decreasingly able to care for themselves. This pattern has been found in some developed societies, yet we know almost nothing about it in the developing world. Even so, it is unlikely to differ substantially from the basic portrayal charted above. At all ages, especially among the oldest old, both family- and policy-based care become essential to people's wellbeing. This simple, straightforward explanation of changes as people age should be valid everywhere, though details and the exact mix of factors will differ. Figure 1 plots the percent of men and women aged 65 and over living alone in 61 societies in 2010–11. Containing data from different population counts, it provides a snapshot of the world at that time. The figure includes a broken line tracking the underlying trend and a solid line showing equal values for men and women. The variety of experiences is evident, with levels of older women living alone ranging from as high as 45–50 percent to as low as 5–10 percent and with levels among men varying from about 25 percent to below 5 percent. Despite this sex differential, a certain congruence between female and male levels is apparent (R2 = .60). The highest levels of single living appear to be concentrated in the richest societies, though this is not always the case (see Japan, for example), and the lowest levels are found in certain Asian and African countries. In most societies, levels of living alone among women are significantly higher than among men, and in some cases the differences are striking. Percentage differences tend to be highest in the richest societies, though the greatest relative differences are found in countries like Iran and Nigeria where levels among women are as much as 5 to 6 times higher than they are among men. In a small number of countries, living alone is more frequent among men than among women, though the differences tend to be small and are concentrated in Caribbean and African societies. With these exceptions, this pattern by sex is almost universal and seems to be relatively stable over time, as demonstrated by the data collected in the 1990s (United Nations 2005). These sex differentials tend to be related to the higher prevalence of widowhood among women. Our strategy for disentangling the multiple factors that determine living alone in later life is based on the extensive use of both country and micro-level data for large samples of countries from different areas of the world. Bivariable and multivariable analysis will provide empirical depth to many of the dimensions contained in the explanatory framework presented above. Our approach is based on the following premises: (i) Living alone in later life is a part of the process of population aging. (ii) Its importance will increase in much of the world in the near future, though in a limited number of mainly developed societies it could remain unchanged or even decrease. (iii) It reflects the role played by family and policy in the management of later life, together with the way health changes as people age. It also reflects individual characteristics such as preferences for living arrangements and marital status. Finally, (iv) it has implications for the health and wellbeing of the elderly, their families, and society. The analysis uses country-level data and the microdata needed to explore the individual determinants of living alone in different societies. The first data set consists of 61 countries. It includes estimates of levels of single living for persons above 65+ circa 2011 together with sex, 2011 levels of the Human Development Index (HDI), per capita gross domestic product (based on purchasing-power-parity, current international dollars and estimated for 2011), and the fertility corresponding approximately to that of the elderly women considered (i.e., TFR during 1970–75). The selected indicator for family systems (population 40–64 living in extended households) is taken from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, international (IPUMSi, see Minnesota Population Center 2017) and is available for 32 countries. An indicator of the differences in life expectancy by sex (female – male) has been generated based on life expectancy at age 60 taken from the UN World Population Prospects Database. Aggregate levels of living alone come from several sources: Eurostat for European countries; census data available in the IPUMSi database for African and some Asian countries; and national statistical offices for China (National Bureau of Statistics of China), Japan (Statistics Bureau of Japan), South Korea (Statistics Korea), Australia (Australia Bureau for Statistics), Canada (Statistics Canada), and the United States (US Census Bureau). Social, economic, and demographic indicators come from United Nations Development Programme (2011) for HDI, International Monetary Fund for GDP, and United Nations (2013) Department of Economic and Social Affairs for 1970–75 TFR. Given the large range of selected countries, including such demographic giants as China and India, the aggregate dataset constitutes a fairly representative sample of the entire world population. The micro census data come for the most part from the IPUMSi database and contain information collected circa 2011 for 32 countries covering much of the world (except Oceania). Data for India come from a 2009 employment survey that is also available in IPUMSi. Census data for England and Wales (2011) and South Korea (2010) were obtained directly from the Office for National Statistics (UK) and Statistics Korea. In the analysis of microdata, our dependent variable is based on the household size of older people and coded as a straightforward dichotomous variable: living alone versus living with others. Our independent variables are: sex; age (coded into five five-year groups from 65–69 to 85+); current marital status (coded into four categories: never married, married, separated/divorced, and widowed); and educational attainment based on ISCED codes (coded into three levels: primary or less, secondary, and university). The entire sample of census microdata used here contains 10,119,645 observations representing 184,088,713 persons aged 65 years and over living in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Theoretical expectations about the process of household formation predict that levels of living alone among elderly people should be an important correlate of levels of development, which in turn are presumed to be associated with material resources, educational outcomes, strong family values, welfare institutions, and demographic characteristics. We sorted our 32 countries according to their scores on the Human Development Index in 2011. For our purposes the HDI is preferable to others indicators because it operationalizes different dimensions (economic, educational, demographic) of development in a synthetic and efficient way.5 Countries with micro census data are grouped into three general categories: high, medium, and low levels of development. The high category includes 12 countries with an average level of human development of .882. It contains 5,983,324 observations and represents a total population 65+ of 86,502,577 people. With a mean score of human development of .752, another 11 countries make up the medium category, amounting to 2,152,680 observations and representing 28,893,663 people 65+. The low category, with a mean HDI of .589, contain 1,983,641 observations representing 68,692,474 people 65+ living in nine countries. While the cut-off points between levels are somewhat arbitrary, the categories built in this way are mostly coherent with other classifications, including the fourfold one used by the United Nations Development Programme. Tables 1a and 1b show descriptive statistics for these categories of countries, including data on sample sizes, sex, age, marital status, educational attainment, and percent living alone. The tables only show countries with micro census data and do not include those countries with only national, aggregate data. Throughout, we make use of both bivariable and multivariable analysis. With country-level data, a series of bivariable scatter plots are presented including data on living alone and data on a number of the variables mentioned above. The strength of bivariable relationships at the aggregate level is measured by the square of Pearson's correlation coefficient (R2). Country-level information is mainly used and interpreted for descriptive purposes to avoid the well-known risks of ecological fallacies and inefficient estimators that arise from this sort of aggregate data. Since the dependent variable is intrinsically binary (living alone versus living with others), logistic regression is the most appropriate statistical technique for the analysis of 32 countries with micro census data. In this case, we estimate several logistic regression models (a pooled model including the 32 countries and three other models, one for each category of development) of living alone adjusted for different sociodemographic characteristics: sex, age, marital status, and educational attainment (our best proxy for socioeconomic status). The results of these models are shown as graphs of odds ratios, though the full models are available upon request. The results of a regression-based decomposition model are also included in order to quantify the contributions to differences between groups of countries with different levels of development corresponding to sociodemographic composition and to other factors associated with rates specific to these populations (called coefficients effect or unexplained component).6 Country-level data describe the variation both in the prevalence of living alone among elderly people throughout the world and in some socioeconomic and demographic characteristics that define the societal contexts where coresidential options are given and resulting decisions are taken. Along with cross-country differentials in proportions of people 65+ living alone, several indicators of wealth, kin availability, and family systems are explored at the aggregate level. With respect to cross-country differentials, Figure 1 shows highest levels of living alone in North American, European, and other developed countries. Nordic countries—Denmark, Finland, and Norway—have the highest levels of elderly women and men living alone, between 45 percent and 50 percent for women and close to 25 percent for men. Considerably lower levels are found in Africa and Asia, with Mali, Bangladesh, and India in the lowest extreme of the global gradient of living alone. Relatively high levels (about 30 percent) of female single living among elderly Iranian and Nigerian women—though not among men— make these two cases outliers in comparison with other countries with similar characteristics, in part due to their relatively high proportions of older widows. Latin American countries (except Argentina and Uruguay) and Caribbean countries (represented here by Trinidad and Tobago) fall in an intermediate position between richer and poorer societies. Overall, these results confirm the stability in recent decades in the distribution of living alone among older persons across countries and continents (United Nations 2005). These differentials point to the association between levels of economic development and living alone. Figure 2 displays the relationship between 2011 per capita gross domestic product and proportions of the population 65+ living alone. Although non-linear, the relation between the two variables is relatively strong (R2 = .70): the higher the per capita GDP, the higher the proportion of elderly people living alone. Here some Eastern European countries deviate from the pattern and lie above the trend line, exhibiting levels of living alone higher than those predicted by their level of economic development. To some extent these anomalous levels of living alone can be explained by higher proportions of elderly widows in these countries. At least for elderly women, an indicator of their kin availability is the number of children they have had. The chosen indicator for measuring kin availability was the total fertility rate for the period 1970–75, or 35–40 years before the census data were collected, when most of these elderly women still were in their reproductive years. TFR is also an indicator of the timing of the demographic transition and therefore an indirect indicator of modernization (Reher 2004). As seen in Figure 3, the lower the fertility during the first half of the 1970s, the higher the likelihood of living alone in later life. A quadratic decreasing relationship linking both characteristics, as well as a solid association (R2 = .73), is visible. India, Bangladesh, and Mali are extreme cases located under the trend line, with levels of elderly people living alone well below the level expected from their very high fertility three or four decades ago. Data for 32 countries on the aggregate relationship between proportions of the population 40–64 years old living in extended households and the population 65+ living alone are presented in Figure 4. The indicator used is a crude measure of the degree of familism at the societal level, indicating both the strength of family systems versus other social institutions and the preponderance of strong family values in a given country. The figure portrays a straightforward linear relationship between the indicators: the fraction of older people living alone tends to decrease as the proportion of extended households among adults rises. At the aggregate level, the incidence of extended households in mid-adulthood accounts for 58 percent of the variance in living alone at old ages. Figure 5 shows the probabilities of the population 65+ living alone estimated from a pooled logistic regression model adjusted by sex, age, marital status, and education within the 32 countries with census micro-data. Results tend to confirm the observed proportions (see Table 1b, last column on the right). In general, the probabilities of living alone among older persons are higher in more developed countries than in those with medium levels of development and, in turn, these probabilities are higher than in the less developed countries. The atypical position of some Eastern European countries, with levels of living alone higher than expected from their level of development, is also corroborated. Uruguay behaves in a similar way, with an estimated probability for elderly people of living alone higher than in Southern European countries or South Korea. When controlling for covariates, the gap between medium and low levels of development in the probabilities of living alone narrows noticeably, although India and Mali still exhibit the lowest probabilities the world over. Probabilities of living alone (percent) by country and level of development estimated from a logististic regression model adjusted by sex, age, marital status, and education. NOTE: Data weighted to give the same weight to all countries. SOURCES: IPUMSi; Office for National Statistics (England and Wales); Statistics Korea. Three multivariable logistic regression models—one for countries at each level of development—were specified in order to gauge the odds ratios of living alone for older people by sex and age (Figure 6) and by marital status and educational attainment (Figure 7) in different contexts of development. Results reported here were obtained within the specified models and thus reflect the effects of any given variable once all other factors have been controlled for. While there is no difference between men and women in their likelihood of living alone in developed countries, a considerably lower likelihood among women is observed in mid- and less-developed countries. Holding other factors constant, at lower levels of development the probability of living alone among older women is lower than among men. An inverted U-shaped relationship of living alone by age can be observed in the three groups of countries. While the increase in the likelihood of living alone as people age is much stronger at higher levels of development, everywhere the odds ratios first increase with age and then decrease. The point of inflection, however, is later in more developed countries (after ages 80–84) than in less developed ones (after 70–74). Among the oldest old (85+), the likelihood of single living is still higher than it is for the reference category (65–69) in the more developed countries, but far below the same reference category in the other two groups of countries. Clearly people in richer countries are more likely to live alone at an advanced age than people in less developed countries. Adjusted odds ratios for living alone by sex and age at three levels of development. NOTE: Estimate",,D. Reher; M.

In the 2015 general election, the Scottish National party and the UK Independence party mounted successful challenges from the periphery. In the 2016 referendum on EU membership, the Vote Leave campaign captured a surprising number of votes from both sides of the traditional political divide. And in the 2017 general election, an unlikely Labour leader turned metropolitan areas red, while the incumbent Conservative Prime Minister turned post-industrial towns blue—bringing the whole party system back into a familiar bipolarity. At this breakneck pace of political change, scholars have struggled to make sense of what is driving British politics, and how. In this paper, we argue that the answer to this question might lie right under our feet. Over the last three decades, the British housing market has undergone a rapid transformation. In the postwar era, British housing featured high levels of social housing and low levels of housing wealth inequality. Today—following a mass social housing sell-off and a historic boom in asset prices—it features the inverse. We argue that this transformation has had a profound impact on British politics by dividing regions, tenures, and generations in a new housing cleavage. To make this case, we examine the recent history of British housing and its relationship to political changes both past and future. We begin by arguing that the performance of the British housing market—both the cause and the effect of local economic fortunes—shaped attitudes toward Britain's relationship to the European Union by structuring voters’ sense of inclusion in the project of international integration. We argue that house prices, even at a highly disaggregated local level, strongly predicted the vote for Leave or Remain. We then turn to the post-Brexit period. Our analysis suggests that housing played a similarly crucial role in the 2017 general election, with parties divided over their representation of different tenures. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for housing policy reform in the context of new tenure coalitions. Real estate has come centre stage in the story of advanced capitalism. While advanced industrial economies relied on manufacturing to drive economic growth in the postwar period, today they rely in large part on the performance of assets like real estate.1 Citizens who once relied on wages for income and pensions for retirement now rely on credit and real estate.2 But Britain presents an extreme case. Since 1971, the stock value of British real estate has risen from roughly $60 billion to over $6 trillion—a 100-fold increase, adjusted for inflation. Housing now accounts for more than 44 per cent of all household wealth.3 The figures are equally striking in terms of real estate's flow contribution to the British economy. Real estate accounts for more than 12 per cent of Britain's gross domestic product—larger than the entire manufacturing sector4 —the majority of which comes from house prices through ‘imputed rent’: hypothetical rental income from owner-occupied homes. The performance of the British economy has long been closely linked with its housing market and, as we shall see, so too is its politics. Figure 1 uses data on (nominal) mean house prices at the ward level (around 5,000 people) between 1996 and 2016. For each year, we order the wards by their mean house price and show the overall distribution across wards, with the circle reflecting the median ward. Two things jump out. First, average nominal prices rose dramatically across the period—from £60,000 in 1996 to £250,000 in 2016, a quadrupling of nominal prices during a period where UK inflation rose just 76 per cent. Second, the distribution of average prices across wards also rose dramatically. The gap in prices between the wards at the 75th and 25th percentile rose from around £35,000 in 1996 to around £185,000 in 2016. Property in Britain has become not only more expensive relative to other goods, but also much more unequally distributed across the country. The broader economic effects of this transition have also been highly unequal. For those who own property in areas like the south of England, rising house prices have heralded greater prosperity. According to Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, property today is a ‘better bet’ for retirement than a pension.5 For those who rent property, however, rising house prices have heralded greater exclusion. In 2015, the average private renter in Britain paid more than 28 per cent of her income on rent. In London, that figure rose to 40 per cent.6 Housing markets also engender inequality in the daily lives of owners and renters. While homeowners enjoy security of tenure, renters in Britain have very few protections compared to their European neighbours. Section 21 of the 1988 Rent Act permits landlords to evict tenants with two months’ notice without citing a grievance. Section 21 evictions have spiked alongside rising property values, as many landlords pursue new tenants to pay higher levels of rent. The result is increasing inequalities of space. While homeowners have enjoyed an increasing ratio of rooms per person, renters have been pushed into smaller units because that is what they can afford.7 The transformation of the British housing market is both product and producer of a new geography of fortune. Regions like the south of England have been well served by the service sector transition of the British economy, while the traditional manufacturing powerhouses in the north of England have suffered. The former have enjoyed higher levels of investment and the inflow of workers that accompany it, driving up demand for housing. The latter have lost out, and the housing market reflects this dearth of demand. The geography of house prices tells the story of the British wealth and well-being. The enormous disparities seen above reflect, in part, the longstanding differences between Britain's regional economies since industrialisation. It is no surprise that homeownership has historically correlated well with Conservative party support:8 richer, more Conservative-supporting areas, tended to have higher house prices on average. The housing boom and bust of the past two decades has to some extent accentuated these divisions. Yet they have also unearthed new political divisions that cross the traditional geographic patterns of voting. In particular, the recent ‘triumph of the city’—wherein inner cities moved from apparently crime-ridden and destitute areas to become highly desirable, well-positioned neighborhoods9 —has created an unfamiliar political geography in Britain. The Brexit referendum of 2016 exposed these new cleavages. The Leave/Remain patterning of vote across local authorities in England and Wales did not match standard Labour/Conservative patterns. In particular, a large number of wealthy cities, towns and nearby rural areas in the south-east and south-west voted Remain, despite a long history of voting Conservative. Similarly, many poorer towns in the Midlands and north-east, traditional Labour strongholds, voted to leave the European Union. Split in this way, both parties remain fundamentally divided on how to approach Brexit. What does explain the geographical pattern of voting in the EU referendum? Ansell argues that house price levels and changes at the local authority level are strong predictors of support for remaining in the European Union.10 In particular, he shows that local authorities with houses twice as expensive had support levels for Remain around 15 percentage points higher, even controlling for their region in the country and local demographics such as age profile, migration rates, unemployment, and local wages. Although data were only officially collected at the local authority level, the BBC was able to acquire ward voting rates for some 1,100 wards. We analyse this data to see if the pattern of high house prices and Remain voting holds at a very local level. Table 1 shows results from statistical regressions at the ward level. Model 1 includes indicators for (logged) median house prices at the ward level and at the local authority (LAD) level. To interpret these results, if we move from a ward where median house prices were £85,000 in 2014 to one where they were £230,000, support for Remain jumps by 10.5 percentage points. A similar shift at the local authority level results in an 8.1 per cent point increase in support for Remain. Models 2 and 3 repeat the exercise adding between 1996 and 2014 in ward median house prices. Moving from a ward with a ‘mere’ tripling of nominal house prices to one with a quadrupling is associated with a 5 per cent increase in support for Remain. The implication is that both long-run levels of house prices and relative growth over the past two decades shaped the Brexit vote. Places that had always done, or were recently doing, ‘better’ were happier with the status quo of remaining in the European Union. Figure 2 provides a striking example of this relationship, splitting out the voting pattern for wards in pro-Leave Wakefield, marginal Stockport, and pro-Remain Cambridge. In each district, there is a very strong relationship between wards with higher house prices having greater support for Remain, even though the three districts had very different average house prices (and indeed support for the EU). House prices both proxy for local economic fortunes and directly drive (dis)satisfaction with the status quo (since those in cheaper houses may resent their exclusion from the housing boom and those with highly appreciated houses have benefitted substantially). In both cases, these mixed fortunes appear to have filtered over into broader (dis-)satisfaction with contemporary British life. The obvious question to ask, given the relationship between housing and the Brexit vote, is whether it transferred over to voter preferences in 2017. The answer appears to be—only partially. That is, many richer Remain voting areas did back the nominally harder Brexit Conservative party in 2017—for example, in David Cameron's old constituency of Witney. Similarly, while the Conservatives had hoped to win many Leave voting Labour constituencies in the Midlands and the north, in reality only a handful of these seats switched sides. Figure 3 gives a sense of the degree to which the Brexit vote scrambled existing voting patterns and their relationship to the housing market. It plots, using the British Election Study of 2017, the probability of an individual voting for the Conservative party by two factors related to where they live—house prices in their local authority and support for Remain in their local authority (controlling for age, gender, education, income, and region). The three unbroken lines represent predicted probabilities of voting Conservative for individuals in areas where house prices average £750,000, £270,000 and £100,000, with the ‘whiskers’ on the plot showing the confidence interval around those predictions. The standard pattern where richer areas vote Conservative and poorer areas vote Labour broadly held up in 2017: voters in local authorities with more expensive housing tended to vote Conservative. However, it is notable that the ‘Remainness’ of areas was negatively connected to Conservative support and that was particularly the case in areas with expensive houses. The support for Conservatives in areas with cheap houses and high support for Leave failed to make up this gap. Graphically, we see a ‘narrowing’ in the effect of house prices on Conservative support as we move from pro-Leave to pro-Remain districts. Since more expensive areas were also more likely to vote Remain (and cheaper places for Leave) on aggregate the sharp drop-off in Conservative support in expensive pro-Remain areas, accompanied by a failure to pick up enough support in pro-Leave poorer areas, arguably lost the Conservatives their majority. In other words, the connection between housing and support for Remain, which cut across traditional class geographies, likely shaped the final outcome of the 2017 general election. Geographically then, house prices cut across traditional lines of political support. What about at the individual level? How did homeowners feel about the Conservatives and was there really a ‘rentquake’? The answer is mixed—it might be better, though awkwardly, described as a ‘rent plus mortgage-quake’. Returning to the British Election Study of 2017, we abstract away from geographical setting and look at individual level characteristics alone in explaining support for the Conservatives. In Figure 4, we examine the effect of housing tenure—conditional on age—on voting Conservative in 2017 (controlling for education, income, gender, Brexit vote, immigration attitudes, and employment status). The figure plots the predicted probability of an individual voting Conservative, with the grey line denoting renters and the black line denoting homeowners (with the confidence intervals around these predictions denoted by the dashed lines). Perhaps the most striking result to consider is that whereas among renters (in private and social housing) age is essentially unrelated to vote choice, among homeowners, there is a striking difference of around 30 per cent as we move from people in their twenties to people in their eighties. Put differently, young people behave very similarly regardless of housing status, whereas among the old, homeowners are much more pro-Conservative than private renters and social housing tenants. The relationship between age and partisanship among homeowners is a function of the variable conditions of their property ownership. For an older cohort, homes were bought cheap and held dear: they reaped the largest gains from the asset boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, and have since transitioned into outright ownership. For a younger cohort, by contrast, homes were purchased at exorbitant price levels—and only by signing onto decades-long mortgages, which expose them to continuous risk of negative equity. Between 2005 and 2016, the percentage of mortgages issued that last thirty-five years or over rose from just 2 per cent to over 15 per cent. In other words, two mechanisms separate young and old homeowners: wealth and risk. Together, they constrained support for Conservatives among younger homeowners in the 2017 election—many of whom voted for a Labour manifesto with strong social protections—while driving it among older homeowners. As is well known, relatively few people own homes in their twenties at present. Still, the longstanding gap in preferences between owners and renters—around which Margaret Thatcher based her political strategy of Right to Buy—only emerges among the middle-aged. Homeowners under the age of around forty behave very similarly to renters politically. Since almost all of these younger homeowners will still have mortgage payments to make, we see here a new ‘coalition’ of renters and mortgagees, against those who fully own their property. Another way of viewing this is that those who benefitted most greatly from rising house prices, by virtue of having bought their house over a decade ago, were the core Conservative support base. One final regional dimension of the 2017 general election is worth noting. House price differences have dynamic effects on political behaviour in that they can ‘lock’ people out of expensive housing markets, forcing them to look for cheaper property elsewhere. There is some evidence that this pattern had political implications in 2017. London house prices rose much more dramatically in the post-2013 housing boom than did prices elsewhere. Accordingly, many younger workers and families moved into the wider south-east and east regions to seek cheaper property, often while continuing to work in London. As Ian Warren argued in a post-election analysis in The Guardian, many of these people carried their previous voting habits and social attitudes with them.11 Analysis of the British Election Study of 2017 shows that, controlling for age, education, gender, and income, individuals were most likely to switch towards Labour from 2015 to 2017 if they lived in the south-east and east regions, as opposed to London. Should this pattern continue, it will further scramble the longstanding political geography of Britain, again driven by the housing market. We have seen that housing is increasingly shaping the geography of British politics in novel ways. What about the possibility of reforms to the housing market itself? We see three key general areas for reform, each with striking political difficulties. The first is to lower prices by reducing the demand for housing relative to other goods. The second is to lower prices by increasing the supply of dwellings, both private construction and social housing. The third is a broader regional recalibration of the British economy that serves to reduce geographical inequalities in house prices. Reducing demand for housing essentially means reducing the growth of mortgage credit both for owners and landlords. This is probably the most advanced area of policy generation given the tighter restrictions on mortgage lending brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2014, which required much more stringent accounting of borrowers’ income and expenditure and capped loan to income ratios. On the tax side, fiscal reforms have made buy-to-let substantially less attractive by increasing stamp duty and reducing tax deductibility. However, such policies lack an obvious political support coalition—landlords and would-be borrowers are directly negatively affected, owners in general may see lower prices, and the only obvious beneficiaries are future buyers—typically young and politically inactive. In terms of increasing housing supply, there may be some more obvious winners, but our analysis suggests that overall policy preferences are deeply divided along the tenure cleavage. Homeowners, eager to protect the value of their nest egg, tend to oppose new housing construction—especially when they expect house prices to rise in the coming years. Renters, by contrast, become increasingly supportive of social housing construction as their expectations of house price inflation rise. The divergent interests of these two groups, in other words, produce direct conflict over policy preferences. Some indicative results appear in Figure 5, which uses the British Social Attitudes Survey of 2010, asking people what their expectations are of future growth in the housing market and their attitudes towards the construction of social housing. The line with hollow circles represents the average predicted probability of supporting construction of social housing among homeowners, whereas the line with filled circles represents average support among renters (the whiskers represent the 95 per cent confidence intervals for these predictions). While attitudes of renters and homeowners are similar in declining or stable housing markets, in rising markets, the two diverge, with homeowners substantially less supportive, and renters more supportive, of social housing. Hence, building a cross-group coalition has been difficult during the secular rise of house prices over the past two decades. The support for social housing construction among renters reflects a significant change in ideal tenure. When house prices were low and stable, renters could expect to rise up the property ladder and move comfortably into homeownership. As house prices rise, however, renters are driven away from the desire to purchase an exorbitantly expensive home and toward a ‘social’ alternative that can protect them from the inflation of the private market. We find a strong and significantly positive relationship between renters’ sense of house price inflation and their desire to live in social housing. Such a shift is reflected in the changing position of the Labour party, which now advocates large-scale investment in social housing over the commitment to first-time buyers that was so central to the New Labour platform. There is some evidence that homeowners are becoming more sympathetic to government attempts at housing reform. Recent data from YouGov suggest that over 40 per cent of homeowners support efforts to ‘bring down house prices’ and ‘build large numbers of new homes’. From the demand side, this shift is likely driven by the intergenerational sympathies: homeowning parents concerned for struggling children in the rental sector. From the supply side, this shift is likely driven by the Conservative party's recognition of renters as a rapidly growing proportion of the electorate, leading Theresa May to proclaim it her ‘personal mission’ to fix the housing market. Yet the prospects for reform, on the whole, appear partisan. The ‘rentquake’ of 2017 has given the Labour party a strong mandate to deliver housing policies that reflect renters’ interests: tenant protections, landlord regulation, and social housing construction. The Conservatives, while showing real movement toward issues like land reform, are likely to back away from policies that undermine the interests of their core constituency of homeowning voters. These sharp differences between renters and owners are further amplified when we consider the possibility of a regional shift in the economy that might ‘recalibrate’ the British housing market, through a systematic attempt to move production, jobs, and investment away from the south-east. The difficulty with doing so is fairly obvious for the Conservative party: by and large this means a relative decline of house prices in core Conservative home counties constituencies. The inability of the Northern Powerhouse agenda to outlive the political fortunes of its creator, George Osborne, testifies to the unlikeliness of a successful Conservative regional agenda. Yet, as we saw in earlier sections, a Labour party that is growing in Remain supporting, high house price areas, will also find itself potentially undermining part of its support base in the metropolitan south-east. Finally, the future of housing policy hinges crucially on the performance of the housing market itself—which, in the context of Brexit, remains highly uncertain. High and rising levels of house prices are likely to lock in partisan sympathies and drive an even deeper tenure divide, allowing for the Labour party to champion even more radical rental sector reform, while increasing the cross-pressure on the Conservatives to strike a balance between their renting and homeowning constituencies. Falling prices—or price gain ‘disappointment,’ which seems more likely—may create a new opportunity for political parties to take the lead in initiating fundamental reforms to the land and housing markets. Such a shift does not imply a radical change in the preferences of British homeowners. While rising house prices tend to reduce support for spending on social housing among homeowners, falling house prices do not necessarily imply the inverse: as we saw in 2008, falling house prices can trigger panic among homeowners who fear slipping into negative equity, pushing political parties to introduce measures like mortgage guarantees that prop up prices and entrench homeowner privileges. Such is the curse of Britain's asset-price addiction: with so much wealth stored in the property market, political parties struggle to navigate a price downturn. In the context of falling prices, then, the prospects for reform depend largely on the priorities of the party in government and the simple chronology of Britain's electoral politics. A Conservative government, dependent on happy homeowners, may well let a crisis of price deflation go to waste—pulling out every trick in the book to keep house prices afloat. A Labour opposition may be able to harness the widespread discontent of the downturn to introduce a new housing regime—but only if it can win a general election on that basis. As Britain enters the greatest period of uncertainty in recent history, the politics of housing hang in this balance.",,Ben W. Ansell; D.

years, sustainable development has represented one of the most important policy goals at the global level. How to design specific policy actions and how to measure performance and results continue to present a challenge. The aim of this paper is to identify a numerical measure of 'sustainable human development' by enlarging human development with more specific environmental aspects. The sustainability condition has been directly analysed on the well‐being side. Building a complex Sustainable Human Development Index may be a hard task because of data availability. European countries represent a useful pilot area for testing the methodology. The key factors of effective sustainable human development are emphasized, comparing a Sustainable Human Development Index with existing traditional indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product and the Human Development Index.

This approach corresponds to the widely known 'weak sustainability criterion' where all the capital assets considered, including manufacturing, social, human, and natural assets, can be substituted in the production function, and the sustainability constraint is represented in the optimal control problem as non‐declining general capital stock (Solow, 1986 Solow, R. M. 1986. 'On the intergenerational allocation of natural resources'. Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 88: 141–148. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). 2. In this context, the use of a neoclassical utilitarian approach such as the GNNP is strictly functional and is used to assess the effective income available as a means to achieving higher well‐being in the same way, as traditional income has been used in the human development approach. 3. For methodological and empirical explanation of effective components of the GS index, see Hamilton and Clemens (1999 Hamilton, K. and Clemens, M. 1999. 'Genuine savings rates in developing countries'. World Bank Economic Review, 13(2): 333–356. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). 4. In this work, we assume that educational attainments are directly reflected by the HDI value, in order to maintain UNDP methodology. For an alternative HDI with diminishing returns for education see Noorbakhsh (1998a Noorbakhsh, F. 1998a. 'A modified Human Development Index'. World Development, 26(3): 517–528. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). 5. The employment rate might be a more appropriate indicator than unemployment but, unfortunately, no homogeneous data are available for all countries for the entire analysed time period, reducing the usefulness of the SHDI to make policy considerations for historical trends. 6. All data used for the empirical analysis are from the Human Development Reports of the UNDP (various years United Nations Development Programme. various years. Human Development Report, Oxford: Oxford University Press. [Google Scholar]), the World Development Indicators data‐book of the World Bank (last version 2003), and the environmental dataset provided by the European Environmental Agency together with Eurostat. 7. In particular, y 5 was not considered at all in the calculation of the x 7 index for Luxembourg, whereas herbicides do not affect soil pollution in Bulgaria, Iceland, and Moldova. The Environmental Index for Estonia does not include the water pollution factor (x 6), and the Air Pollution Index (x 5) was not available for Albania, Malta, Moldova, Russian Federation, and Switzerland. An alternative SHDI‐2 has been calculated replacing missing data with the average value of the regional area of each country (i.e. Baltic Republics for Estonia, Eureopan Union 15 for Iceland, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, Accession countries for Bulgaria and Malta, and Transition economies for Albania, Moldova, and Russian Federation). Results have been compared with the original SHDI. 8. The Borda rule provides a ranking order on the basis of the sum of rankings for each component. Countries are ranked according to each single component, and then the resulting ranks are added. Finally, countries are ranked on the basis of their composite scores. 9. For methodological specification of a Meta Index based on the 'benefit of the doubt' approach, see Cherchye and Kuosmanen (2004 Cherchye, L. and Kuosmanen, T. 2004. ""'Benchmarking sustainable development: a synthetic meta‐index approach'"". In UNU‐WIDER Research Papers RP2004/28, Helsinki: World Institute for Development Economics Research. [Google Scholar]). 10. The Borda rule has been applied to all of the three alternative SHDIs. Table 1 presents results for SHDI‐1B and SHDI‐2B. The results for SHDI‐3B are not reported in Table 1 because they are very similar to the other indices. All details are available from the authors upon request. 11. Evaluation of the SHDI trends has been based on the formulation of SHDI‐1 (as equation (3)). The other indices with a modified ENV factor do not show large differences considering the average values for country groups.","In recent years, sustainable development has represented one of the most important policy goals at the global level. How to design specific policy actions and how to measure performance and results continue to present a challenge. The aim of this paper is to identify a numerical measure of ‘sustainable human development’ by enlarging human development with more specific environmental aspects. The sustainability condition has been directly analysed on the well‐being side. Building a complex Sustainable Human Development Index may be a hard task because of data availability. European countries represent a useful pilot area for testing the methodology. The key factors of effective sustainable human development are emphasized, comparing a Sustainable Human Development Index with existing traditional indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product and the Human Development Index.",V.

Four main results will be derived. First, a pension system is (constrained) efficient if the existing system itself and reforms are restricted to guarantee that benefits are proportional to contributions in present value terms. Second, the result does not carry over to other pension systems where the benefits of a retiree are proportional to weighted individual contributions. Third, if the actual PAYG scheme is not a second-best-optimum for some generations, a welfare improving reform is possible provided that the government is not restricted to systems with partial equivalence of contributions and benefits in present value terms. A Pareto-improving transition from the PAYG system to a fully funded system might become feasible provided that the change in the pension scheme is accompanied by an adequate compensating redistribution among generations. Fourth, partial equivalence in present value terms, which requires uniform benefit-adjusted taxation of labor income, does not ensure intergenerational efficiency in all circumstances. However, if uniform benefit-adjusted taxation were optimal, a pension system like the German PAYG system would not be intergenerationally efficient since it misses partial equivalence in present value terms.","Summary This paper employs a three-period-overlapping-generations model to discuss intergenerational (in-)efficiency of a PAYG system when labor supply is endogenous. Four main results will be derived. First, a pension system is (constrained) efficient if the existing system itself and reforms are restricted to guarantee that benefits are proportional to contributions in present value terms. Second, the result does not carry over to other pension systems where the benefits of a retiree are proportional to weighted individual contributions. Third, if the actual PAYG scheme is not a second-best-optimum for some generations, a welfare improving reform is possible provided that the government is not restricted to systems with partial equivalence of contributions and benefits in present value terms. A Pareto-improving transition from the PAYG system to a fully funded system might become feasible provided that the change in the pension scheme is accompanied by an adequate compensating redistribution among generations. Fourth, partial equivalence in present value terms, which requires uniform benefit-adjusted taxation of labor income, does not ensure intergenerational efficiency in all circumstances. However, if uniform benefit-adjusted taxation were optimal, a pension system like the German PAYG system would not be intergenerationally efficient since it misses partial equivalence in present value terms. Zusammenfassung In diesem Artikel wird mittels eines Drei-Perioden-Modells überlappender Generationen die intergenerationale (In-)Effizienz eines umlagefinanzierten Alterssicherungssystems bei endogenem Arbeitsangebot untersucht. Die Untersuchung führt zu den folgenden Resultaten: Ein Alterssicherungssystem ist (beschränkt) effizient, wenn die Rentenzahlungen unter diesem System und unter etwaigen Alternativen proportional zu den Gegenwartswerten der Beitragszahlungen sind bzw. sein müssen. Sofern die zulässigen Systeme aber nur Proportionalität von Rentenzahlungen und beliebig gewichteten Beitragszahlungen gewährleisten, ist beschränkte Effizienz nicht garantiert. Im allgemeinen sind Pareto-verbessernde Reformen dann möglich, wenn das existierende Alterssicherungssystsem kein zweitbestes System darstellt. Teilhabeäquivalenz in Gegenwartswerten und damit im Zeitablauf konstante rentenadjustierte Steuersätze sind nicht notwendigerweise optimal. Das deutsche System verletzt Teilhabeäquivalenz in Gegenwartswerten. Ob es optimal ist, wie in Deutschland das Arbeitseinkommen in jungen Jahren stärker zu belasten als das Arbeitseinkommen in den Jahren vor dem Eintritt in den Ruhestand, ist letztlich eine empirisch zu klärende Frage.",M.

formalizes the political mechanisms that prompt demographic change and augment economic development. We demonstrate that in addition to well-established economic determinants, fertility decisions, human capital accumulation and economic development are altered by three fundamental political variables: political freedom, political stability, and political capacity. Using the model, we derive a set of conditions that enable poor nations to escape poverty traps. The formal deductions are supported by empirical analysis utilizing a panel of 108 countries from 1960 to 2004. Our findings demonstrate that political change triggers a demographic transition that catapults nations onto the path of sustained economic growth. Our results show that developing nations with capable, free, and stable political systems can substantially close the economic gap that divides rich nations from poor nations within a generation. This research is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (SBR-9730474). Notes 1 CitationBecker (1993) identifies innate ability and environmental influences as the components of human capital. Using the generational structure of the model, we allow parents to transmit some of their human capital to their children. Since children's inherited traits are more fully expressed when parental nurturing is high, family structure is a primary environmental influence on the intergenerational transmission of human capital. CitationHanushek (1994) shows that as the number of siblings in a family rises, adult earnings and educational attainment of each child declines. 1. This research is motivated in part by the observation that few societies have had major reductions in fertility before attaining significant gains in education and income. Our formal model demonstrates—along with much of the literature—that increases in income reduce fertility (CitationNotestein, 1945; CitationKuznets, 1955; CitationBecker and Tomes, 1976; CitationBecker and Barro, 1988; CitationBecker, Murphy, and Tamura, 1990). However, we show that gradual income growth is unlikely to trigger observed rapid demographic transitions. Further, because large families reduce the ability of parents to transfer human capital to their offspring, high fertility is a proximate cause of low productivity and persistent poverty. 2. Our model is consistent with previous work showing that countries with a paucity of human or physical capital are generally trapped in poverty by their low incomes and concomitant high birth rates (CitationBecker, Murphy, and Tamura, 1990). We extend this literature by showing that governments that provide freedoms for citizens, have sufficient political capacity, and maintain low levels of political instability that can propel their economies into a demographic transition and attain self-sustaining growth. 3. The original formal model was developed in CitationFeng, Kugler, and Zak (2000a). See Appendix for the formal derivation. 4. For simplicity, physical capital is not shown in Figure 1. 5. We approximate ln(S/η) by ln(S) + ln(η) which is valid since S/η is small. 6. We take the model of endogenous growth seriously, as in CitationHall and Jones (1999), so that we test it in income levels, following its predictions, and not in growth rates which implicitly imply convergence. 7. We reject the null hypothesis of unit roots (CitationLevin, Lin and Chu 2002) for all three dependent variables examined in this study. The results: 8. Another issue is country-specific fixed effects. We also estimated a fixed effects model using the two lag specifications for all models. While the magnitudes of the parameter estimates reported below for political variables attenuate when controlling for country-specific effects, all explanatory variables remain statistically significant. The reduction in the coefficient estimates makes sense since the political aspects of the model explain why outcomes vary across countries, and the country-specific constant picks up some of this variation. 9. Because the theory specifies the sign for each coefficient, one-tail hypothesis tests are used.","We present a dynamic general equilibrium model that formalizes the political mechanisms that prompt demographic change and augment economic development.

We allow the IGEs to be heterogeneous, by leaving the relationship of parental and child incomes unspecified, while acknowledging and addressing the latent nature of both child and parental permanent incomes and the resulted life-cycle bias. Our framework enables us to test the widely imposed assumption that the intergenerational mobility function is linear. Applying our method to the Panel Studies of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, we decisively reject the commonly imposed linearity assumption and find substantial heterogeneity in the IGEs across the population. We confirm an important finding that the IGEs with respect to parental income exhibit a U-shape pattern, which is occasionally highlighted in the analysis using transition matrices. Specifically, there is a considerable degree of mobility among the broadly defined middle class, but the children of both high- and low-income parents are more likely to be high- and low-income adults, respectively. This result also provides insights into the (intertemporal) Great Gatsby curve, suggesting that a higher level of inequality within one generation may lead to a higher level of social immobility in the next generation in the U.S.","This paper provides a new framework to estimate intergenerational mobility elasticities (IGE) of children's income with respect to parental income. Our approach is nonparametric allowing for heterogeneity in IGEs and nonlinearity by leaving the relationship unspecified, while acknowledging the latent nature of both child and parental permanent incomes. Our approach also addresses life-cycle bias directly in estimation without requiring knowledge of permanent income as the previous literature does. We confirm some of the previous findings and also have some novel results. First, we uncover that the association between observed annual income and permanent income varies over the life cycle; and that the observed patterns differ over generations, although the latter result is statistically insignificant due to large variances. Second, we find strong evidence that there exists substantial heterogeneity in IGEs across population and that the mobility function is nonlinear. The implied IGE exhibits a Ushape pattern with ""twin-peaks"". Specifically, there is a considerable degree of mobility among the broadly defined middle class, but both the children of high and low income fathers are more likely to be high and low income adults, respectively. This result suggests that the U.S. is indeed the ""land of opportunity"" to live out the ""American Dream"", just not for everyone! These results survive a battery of robustness checks.

responded to social changes brought about by state policies and practices, gradually altering their position in the domestic sphere from statusless to new players in family affairs. While favorable conditions in larger social settings are necessary and important, equally important have been the agencies of who took advantage of the new opportunities to challenge the patriarchal order of family life. By focusing on individual women, the previously marginalized members of the family, this article identifies and provides a better understanding of the most active driving force of family change from within. (Young women, agency, family change, China) ********** Although there are still many issues under debate among students of the Chinese family, it is widely agreed that the decline of parental authority and power is the most visible and significant change that has occurred in the domestic sphere in rural China since 1949. Such a trend began in the heyday of socialist transformation during the 1950s (Yang 1959) and continued in both the collective period (Parish and Whyte 1978) and the post-collective reform era (Davis and Harrell 1993; Bossen 2002). Thus far, most studies see the decline of parental power and authority as a result of a set of social changes occurring in larger social settings, such as the implementation of the new marriage law and other government policies, the state-sponsored attack on patrilineal ideology and kinship organization, and public ownership that disabled the family as a unit of production. The contribution of individual agency to the shifting power balance across generational line, especially the role played by women, however, has been by and large underplayed, if not completely ignored. To balance the previous emphasis on external, social causes, this article explores the active role played by to redefine intergenerational power relations in particular and other dimensions of private life in general. Throughout this article the term young women is used to refer to rural between the ages of 15 to 24, or as defined by social terms, those who are going through the transition period from a teenage daughter to a daughterin-law. For a rural woman, this is the most difficult and important period in her life, full of changes and challenges (Wolf 1972). In the areas where this study was conducted, in this age group are referred to as guniang or yatou, which may be translated as in English. But guniang or yatou refer only to unmarried women. Once a woman marries, she is no longer a girl; but has been transformed into a daughter-in-law (xifu) and an adult woman. In a traditional family, were marginal outsiders with only a temporary position, as daughters married out and new daughters-in-law entered the domestic group under the rules of patrilineal exogamy and patrilocal post-marital residence. Thus, daughters were commonly regarded as a drain on family wealth and new daughters-in-law were seen as a potential threat to the existing family order. In comparison to their male siblings, girls were statusless, powerless, and somewhat dangerous; they could acquire a proper place in the domestic sphere only by becoming mothers (Baker 1979; Freedman 1966; Watson 1985, 1986; Wolf 1972; Bossen 2002). As a result of their anonymity in family life, have drawn little scholarly attention thus far and, admittedly, they also constitute the most difficult age group to study for a male researcher. Male informants are the usual sources when conducting fieldwork. When I tried to reach female informants, I found myself more often talking with older women, the supposedly more knowledgeable and certainly more powerful woman in a household, typically the mother (or mother-in-law) who manages the household budget. …","Since the early 1950s, several generations of young women in rural north China have responded to social changes brought about by state policies and practices, gradually altering their position in the domestic sphere from statusless ""outsiders"" to new players in family affairs.

weight-for-age <-2SD), stunted (short child; height-for-age <-2SD), and/or wasted (thin child; weight-for-height <-2SD).Undersize in children is actually a crude proxy for overall socio-economic underdevelopment and intergenerational constraint of maternal undersize, but it has paradoxically come to be perceived as a proxy for nutritional inadequacy in both mainstream and under-privileged populations.Evidence indicates that only some nutrients or food-based interventions, including those during pregnancy, increase anthropometric indices, and those too do so only modestly (0.1-0.25 SD or 5%-10% deficit) with unsustainable benefits.Other determinants include water, sanitation and hygiene; nutrition counselling; maternal characteristics; curative and preventive health care; maternal, household and community resources; literacy; income; women empowerment; safety nets; and genes.In tandem with the overall national development, time trends show a gradual decline in the incidence of undersize in children; this trend has hastened in the past decade, even amongst the underprivileged.The steady decline in the prevalence of stunting and underweight, with wasting levels remaining stagnant, is observed in neighbouring countries too and appears unrelated to specific determinants.Biological and population transition evidence suggests that rapid and simultaneous declines in both stunting and wasting are challenging to achieve.Patience is required to overcome the legacy of considerable intergenerational handicap.A narrow focus on nutrients-based solutions will fail to accelerate progress.Comprehensive and equitable development is the key to success.With substantial earlier investments in dietary subsidies, action is now warranted in other sectors to rapidly benefit the marginalised.",,H.

To do so, we construct a general equilibrium overlapping generations model with intergenerational linkages, a higher education choice as well as a multi-stage human capital production process during childhood and adolescence with parental and government schooling investments. The model features rich cross-sectional heterogeneity, distinguishes between single and married parents, and is disciplined by US household survey data on income, wealth, education and time use. Studying the transitions induced by unexpected policy reforms we show that the ""free college"" and the ""better schools"" reform generate significant welfare gains, which take time to materialize and are lower in general than in partial equilibrium. It is optimal to combine both reforms: tuition subsidies make college affordable even for children from poorer parental backgrounds and better schools increase human capital thereby reducing dropout risk.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Error fetching abstract,,theoretical,,theoretical,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/294852/1/1888248300.pdf

The first essay looks at human capital from a growth perspective. Essays two and three focuses on the individual’s occupational decision and its relation to family background.The first essay attempts to capture the effects on long run economic growth and transitional dynamics of the interaction between human capital and R&D. We do this by allowing for endogenous human capital accumulation in an economy where the number of products and technologies expands because profit maximizing entrepreneurs do R&D. We find that, in the absence of scale effects, long run growth is determined by the economy’s capacity to accumulate human capital. A relative lack of R&D capital causes the economy to grow slowly during its transition to the steady state, while a relative abundance of R&D capital gives high growth rates during transition.In the second essay, the classical Roy-model of selection on the labor market is extended in order to analyze intergenerational mobility. This is done through the introduction of ability uncertainty that is linked to family background. In contrast to to additional human capital models of intergenerational mobility, this mechanism rather than differences in access to capital markets links occupational oucomes of offspring to parents. We study the effects of income redistribution on mobility and talent allocation. It is found that redistribution has implications for intergenerational mobility and talent allocation through its influence on individual occupational choices. However, we conclude that the presence of a trade-off between redistribution and intergenerational mobility depends on the extent of similarity of occupations with regard to ability sensitivity and wage rates, and on the degree of individual risk aversion. Whether redistribution occurs only within an occupation or simultaneously within and across occupations is also inportant for the implicatons for mobility and talent allocation.In essay three, a model of occupational choice and human capital investment is developmed and tested. The model allows family background to influence occupational choice through access to economic resources, differences in costs of schooling, and ability uncertainty linked to background similar to that discussed in essay two. It is predicted that life time utility of children from less well-off background is more sensitive to economic incentives when risk aversion is strong. The model also predicts that people are more sensitive to economic incentives when considering occupations distant from their parent occuations. The implications of the theoretical model are tested and largely confirmed on Swedish data using a mixed multinominal logit framework which explicitly accounts for unobserved ability heterogeneity.",,,both,,both,,

In the model, agents are endowed with a high-dimensional genome that determines their cognitive and physical characteristics.

After calibrating the model, we examine the impact of physical, social, and economic institutions on population growth and economic performance. We find that institutional factors significantly impact economic performance by affecting marriage, family size, and the intergenerational transmission of genes. The principal novel findings are that i) genetic diversity has a nonmonotone causal impact on population size and economic performance; ii) an endogenous population threshold exists which, absent frictions, causes societies with declining populations and output to reverse course and grow; and iii) that the emotion love substantially accelerates economic growth by increasing genetic diversity ‘just enough’, which we term ‘The Goldilocks Principle’.",P.

This study assesses whether maternal poor early life environment predicts her child's adiposity using cross sectional design on Maya schoolchildren aged 7-9 and their mothers (n = 57 pairs). We compared maternal chronic early life environment (stature) with her child's adiposity (body mass index [BMI] z-score, waist circumference z-score, and percentage body fat) using multiple linear regression, controlling for the child's own environmental exposures (household sanitation and maternal parity). The research was performed in the south of Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, a low socioeconomic urban area in an upper middle income country. The Maya mothers were very short, with a mean stature of 147 cm. The children had fairly high adiposity levels, with BMI and waist circumference z-scores above the reference median. Maternal stature did not significantly predict any child adiposity indicator.

The empirical results suggest that even a quarter of a century after displacement, first generation migrants and native West Germans that were comparable before the war perform strikingly different. Migrants have substantially lower incomes and are less likely to own a house or to be self-employed. Displaced agricultural workers, however, have significantly higher incomes. This income gain can be explained by faster transitions out of low-paid agricultural work. Differences in the labor market performance of second generation migrants resemble those of the first generation.

This grouping reflected a predominantly infectious disease burden in low-income and middle-income countries, which has since tilted towards NCDs.

Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington, DC2011Google Scholar Evidence is mounting that some NCDs are partly or wholly communicable.

Furthermore, the present misnomer implies that the causes are individual rather than societal. This implication is simply not the case: NCDs have largely sociogenetic antecedents, and efforts focused on individual behaviour have little overall effect if the social and policy environments do not change in parallel. The ongoing and largely unhelpful emphasis on individual healthy choices might hamper a shift towards more effective and equitable population-level policies such as tighter tobacco control and measures to address obesogenic environments. Unfortunately, system-wide socioeconomic drivers are difficult to change and do not have the political expediency of blaming poor people for making poor decisions. Additionally, regulatory changes in tobacco, alcohol, and food policy can face stiff opposition from powerful economic interests. Calling the world's biggest killer ""non-communicable"" propagates confusion, undermines efforts to spur a sense of urgency, and deflects attention from effective system-wide interventions. There have been repeated calls to rename NCDs and a widespread acceptance that the term is a poor fit, but the lack of convincing alternatives and inertia stemming from widespread use seem unsurmountable. Renaming NCDs is not an issue of pedantry; it is an important means of consolidating the growing support for these ubiquitous conditions and invigorating the debate around interventions that stand the best chance of stemming the pandemic. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have cemented the importance of NCDs on the international agenda, and over the next few months the global health community will choose appropriate indicators for Goal 3. Now is the perfect time to refocus the global response through reframing the issue. Unless this long-debated issue of naming is comprehensively addressed, it will regularly resurface and might stand in the way of real progress. Although we are certain that the name NCD needs to go, we do not have a perfect alternative. We favour the terms societal and ecological (ie, the relation of living organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings) but hereby invite debate on the topic under the auspices of The Lancet Global Health. Online, public, global forums—akin to the global dialogue of the Global Coordinating Mechanism on the Prevention and Control of NCDs and the 2 month online debate that followed, or the SDG indicator consultation—are setting new norms of transparency and inclusion of multiple stakeholders in important decision-making processes. What should this group of conditions be called? Should the lines be redrawn to include injuries? Is chronic a synonym? Are social injustice, globalisation, or socioeconomic transitions causative pathogens? Overall, this global consultative process should include not only the submission of new names but also a substantive discussion on the specific diseases and risks addressed. The new classification could be institutionalised in the next version of the System of Health Accounts and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Development Assistance Committee system (soon to include line items specific to chronic diseases), and potentially adopted by WHO in 2020, after the Global Action Plan for NCDs expires. We believe that this process has the potential to foster innovation, multisectoral action, and increased funding for the conditions that kill 38 million people each year.

Reframing non-communicable diseases – Authors' replyLavanya Vijayasingham and Pascale Allotey suggest a conceptual extension of the socially transmitted condition (STC) framework to emphasise the role of social factors not only in predisposing individuals to the development of these diseases, but also in shaping the disease course and lived experience. Their reasoning is borne by evidence that socioeconomic factors correlate with STC behavioural risk factors,1 prevalence rates,2 and risk of premature death.3 Full-Text PDF Open AccessRenaming non-communicable diseasesLuke Allen and Andrea Feigl issue an impassioned call to reframe non-communicable diseases (NCDs).1 They argue that ""non-communicable"" insinuates ""less important"" relative to infectious diseases, producing a dearth of NCD attention and funding. Granting a priori precedence to infectious diseases as the primary concerns for mortality and biosecurity risks undermining broader collaborative contributions aimed at promoting health equity. Full-Text PDF Open AccessReframing non-communicable diseasesThe collective dynamic initiated by Luke Allen and Andrea Feigl1 is remarkable, and explains why they felt the need to formulate a new proposal,2 which involves renaming and reframing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as socially transmitted conditions (STCs). Full-Text PDF Open AccessRenaming non-communicable diseasesThe call by Luke Allen and Andrea Feigl (February, 2017)1 to reframe non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is welcome. The lack of focus on these increasingly important causes of morbidity, impairment, and mortality, with their commensurate increasing consumption of health and societal resources and reduced economic contribution, is inappropriate and damaging for all the reasons Allen and Feigl cogently argue. Few things that are described in the negative as what they are not obtain the understanding or action they deserve. Full-Text PDF Open AccessRenaming non-communicable diseasesThe debate opened up through the Comment by Luke Allen and Andrea Feigl1 is timely and welcomed.

Full-Text PDF Open AccessRenaming non-communicable diseasesReframing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) to ""spur a sense of urgency"" and ""focus attention on effective system-wide interventions""1 makes sense.

We combine different EU comparable data sources with microsimulation techniques in order to measure how agents resort to the three available resource allocation devices over their lifecycle (asset market and public and private transfers), extending the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) methodology at the micro level. Agents are heterogeneous in age, gender, education level and family type. Simulating population dynamics at the micro level allows us to capture not only the ageing process but also the educational transition and the change in family structures occurring in parallel. The resulting projection model allows us to simulate the lifetime net transfers received by individuals from the government and the family, and to compute the adjustment needed to keep the sustainability of the welfare system. The analysis is applied to four European countries representing different welfare state regimes (Spain, Austria, Finland and the United Kingdom). We find differences in the role of private and public transfers in intra and intergenerational redistribution across countries, which can be linked to the various welfare state regimes. Apart from the expected differences observed by gender and by education level, there are significant differences in the interplay between private and public transfers related to parenthood. While parents privately transfer substantially more than childless people in all studied countries, the Austrian welfare state is the only one that compensates high and medium education groups for these differences through higher public transfers to parents. Such compensation is much weaker and more targeted towards the lower educated in the other countries.",,M. Spielauer; T.

Using the Continuous Sample of Working Histories (CSWH), which includes administrative data about working lives and personal characteristics of Spanish workers, we shed light on the effect of the Great Recession on income inequality between cohorts in Spain. As a proxy of income, we employ monthly earnings data, provided by the CSWH. From a life course approach, we use two age-period-cohort (APC) models which allow us to separately identify three components: cohort, age and period effects. First, we examine relative earnings which will reveal whether there are income differences between generations. Second, we measure how absolute earnings have developed over time. Our results suggest that some generations are more disadvantaged in terms of income by their year of birth than others. Likewise, the evidence points out that the economic context experienced by a generation in their transition to the labour market is a key factor in the development of their income.",,Marta Escalonilla; B.

We find that Kyrgyzstan, like Eastern European middle income transition economies, generally maintained high educational mobility, comparable to the levels during Soviet times. However, we find that the younger cohorts, who were exposed to the transition during their school years, experienced a rapid decline in educational mobility. We also document that gender differences in schooling and educational mobility, found among older-aged individuals, disappeared in the younger population.",Error fetching abstract,,empirical,,false,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/71114/1/740352989.pdf

is generally transferred from parents to their children in societies where the private ownership of land is established. While the way in which land is transferred intergenerationally varies according to societies and times, inheritance is basically classified into partible and impartible. In the former, parents' land is divided among their children, while in the latter, land is given to only one heir. Scholars have argued that land inheritance rules exert an important influence on rural society and economy (Platteau and Baland 2001). How land is transferred between generations naturally affects agricultural production since it determines farm size (Ram et al. 1999) and brings about changes in land distribution and rural class structure (Khera 1973; Wiegandt 1977). It has also been found to shape family structure and social interaction among kin (Goldschmidt and Kunkel 1971; Khera 1972) and determine the rate and the timing of marriage (Emigh 1997) and birth rate (Habakkuk 1955). Furthermore, some scholars argue that land inheritance rules can influence the development of the manufacturing industry since it affects labor mobility from rural areas (ibid.; Wegge 1999).Although the empirical data on intergenerational land transfer1) in Cambodia is scarce, partible transfer seems to have been common practice. For example, Ebihara (1971) found that in a village in Kandal province in the late 1950s, farmland was divided among children in a basically equal manner (ibid.). Land became collective property under the Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) regime and subsequently the People's Republic of Kampuchea in the early 1980s, but was distributed among households after the dissolution of collective farming groups (krom samokki) in the 1980s. Since then, parents distribute land to their children. In fact, some studies show that children who got married after the land distribution of the 1980s received land from their parents (Amakawa 2001; Yagura 2005; Kobayashi 2007). However, these studies do not examine whether partible (and equitable) land transfer is still a common practice in rural Cambodia because they do not use data from the parents' side.In this regard, we must note that socio-economic changes experienced in rural Cambodia since the 1980s have had a considerable influence on land transfer practice. First, population is increasing rapidly while unexploited land is diminishing-in other words, land is becoming a scarce resource. In fact, while there remains untapped land in some regions, such as the northwestern and the northeastern provinces, there seems to be little land left for agricultural use in regions with a high population density such as the provinces surrounding Phnom Penh.2) On the other hand, the baby-boomers of the 1980s have started to get married in the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to custom, parents should give land to all these married children, yet this may not be possible where land is becoming scarce. Second, labor migration from rural areas is increasing, which can also be regarded as a response to land scarcity. Since the middle of the 1990s, the migration of rural youth to urban areas, especially Phnom Penh, has increased with the development of sectors such as the garment industry, construction, and commerce in urban areas. Increased opportunities to earn a living outside rural areas make farmland less necessary.Both these changes ought to promote a transition from partible to impartible transfer of land. The change to impartible land transfer then raises the question of who will be deprived of access to land and how these landless children should make a living.On the other hand, increasing employment opportunities in non-agricultural sectors may actually make it possible to sustain partible land transfer because the non-agricultural income can compensate for a small agricultural income (Platteau and Baland 2001). …","(ProQuest: ... denotes non-US-ASCII text omitted.)I IntroductionFarmland under family farming is generally transferred from parents to their children in societies where the private ownership of land is established.

In sub‐Saharan Africa, documented instances of weakly enforced statutory laws and outdated or misaligned customary laws create a space for practices that undermine the fair and smooth transition of wealth across generations. Purpose This study presents data drawn from a larger mixed‐methods study that evaluated a succession (inheritance) curriculum offered in a farming community in Kenya. Approach and Methods A sub‐set of intervention participants ( n = 58) ranging in age from 20 to 78 were invited to participate in post‐test focus group discussions. Discussions followed a semi‐structured interview guide and included questions that evaluated the succession curriculum. Findings In addition to evaluating the intervention, emerging conversations centred on the economic and sociocultural significance of intergenerationally held family wealth. The narrative from these focus groups underscores the importance the community places on family‐held wealth and how failures in the financial socialization process have compromised the generational wealth‐transfer system. Further, both younger and older participants identified youth unemployment and substance misuse as factors that have led to a breakdown in the wealth‐transfer process. This breakdown can and has resulted in the loss of household wealth, as well as in the marginalization of vulnerable individuals including women and children. Implications This article concludes by identifying mutable factors that have implications for economic empowerment policies and programmes. This includes strengthening parental financial capabilities and facilitating access to legal resources to facilitate wealth transfers.",,Njeri Kagotho; N. N.

However, there is a growing tendency in the nuclearization of households as intergenerational co-residence is undermined by growing wage labour opportunities that provide incentives for rural–urban migration and because small nuclear families adapt better to urban societies characterized by high geographic and social mobility. The objective of this paper is therefore to jointly study for a selection of low- to middle-income countries the socioeconomic and demographic conditions of women aged 15–34 and their partners in relation to their household patterns with particular interest in the comparison of nuclear and extended households. The analysis will mainly rely on data from the Integrated Public Use of Microdata Series International database (https://international.ipums.org/international/) from which census samples for the last two or latest available census rounds for 18 countries have been extracted. Results showed that women being of older age (within the 15–34 range) and at the same time having attained at least primary school education, having a husband who does not work in the primary sector and who is neither much older nor much younger were all associated with living in a nuclear household. However, individual factors explained only a small part of the overall variation in the household arrangements of young couples, suggesting that differences between countries in these dimensions do not explain much of the difference in household structure.

Relatively little research has focused on how family background impacts the process of family formation, let alone the consequences of their family decisions for their wellbeing. This dissertation focusses on two central themes, using a life-course perspective. First, it examines the influence of family background, particularly parental education, on family formation over time using Dutch and European survey data. Second, this dissertation studies the impact of family formation on income (as a financial indicator) and obesity (as a health indicator) in young adulthood, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, a panel survey from the United States. Results show that (1) Family background continues to create a divide in family formation behavior and that there are indications that these disparities in family formation behavior between individuals from different family background could be increasing in Europe, with those from lower family background increasingly opting for parenthood outside of marriage. (2) Young adults’ own family pathways during the transition to adulthood, on top of career pathways, influence personal income and obesity in young adulthood. (3) Individuals from advantaged family background have a higher personal income compared to their disadvantaged peers, even if they follow the same career and family pathways during the transition to adulthood. All in all, this research concludes that family background (still) plays an important role in shaping family formation pathways and that this may partly explain the intergenerational transmission of (dis)advantage.",,,empirical,,both,,

Judeo-Spanish dialect spoken in Istanbul. BY REY ROMERO. LIBRA. 2012. 202 pages. Over the past five centuries, the Judeo-Spanish language has experienced nearly every linguistic condition from development to fossilization, from prosperity to endangerment, and from native acquisition to semispoken and passive understanding under linguistic restructuring. These processes take on a special significance in Rey Romero's book Spanish in the Bosphorus. In this work, Romero explores the sociolinguistic situation of the Judeo-Spanish dialect in Istanbul, Turkey, while relating this unique vernacular back to its historical linguistic origins and dialectal variation. This study is the result of ethnographic research conducted by Romero within the Judeo-Spanish community of Istanbul and is an exceptional resource for all readers interested in learning about the language and its history or delving into the peculiarities found in this once-thriving linguistic community. Of particular note throughout this text is Romero's interest in contributing to the revitalization of the language. He notes that his greatest aspiration is for his work to 'help in some way to assess the linguistic needs of the Sephardic community in Istanbul' (13). While the aim of his research is to analyze structural consequences caused by the language shift of the Judeo-Spanish dialect in Istanbul, Romero efficiently provides a wealth of additional information that leads the reader to further inquiry. Aside from the overview of Judeo-Spanish history and a detailed description of the language and its community, this book is an in-depth, intergenerational linguistic exploration of Judeo-Spanish throughout Istanbul. At the core of Romero's research is the exploration of language shift in order to describe the 'situation in which a bilingual community is slowly replacing its first language with a second one' (17). In order to tackle this topic Romero interviews twenty-five speakers of various proficiencies in Judeo-Spanish ranging from the ages 1997, and describes the linguistic restructuring of Judeo-Spanish as a 'progressive transition' (22). The pool of informants was made up of eighteen women and seven men, and each person participated in three sociolinguistic tasks: the first dealt with language attitudes and perceptions; the second involved translating sixty-one sentences from Turkish to Judeo-Spanish; and the third prompted them to speak informally so that their speech could be recorded. Romero notes that his original number of informants was twice as large; however, the twenty-five were selected because they were 'born in Istanbul or moved there at a very young age' and were able to participate in all three parts of the interview (70). Romero regularly compares Fishman's (1991) Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS) with the given language vitality associated with Judeo-Spanish. The author assesses the Judeo-Spanish of Istanbul to be at Stage 7 and describes the 'xenophobic and nationalistic policies, mass migrations, and a reduced community [that] finally hindered the transmission of the language to the next generation' (66). This is important to Romero's study given that he works with a language classified as endangered and more than two-thirds of his informants were 'fifty or older, beyond child-bearing age, which means that they can no longer create families and transmit the language to a new generation' all characteristic of GIDS Stage 7 (71). Intergenerational studies dealing with Judeo-Spanish are few, and Romero offers much to linguistic literature through his research, yet he notes that younger speakers were considered semispeakers at best and that the youngest members of this pool of speakers ... were not able to produce any complete sentences in Judeo-Spanish' (72). For this reason, certain linguistic experiments only included twenty-two of the twenty-five informants, three of whom were in the 19-29 age range. …",,,false,,false,,

trying to gain access to affordable housing at the time of study, the early 2010s. By then, more than thirty years of housing reforms had completely changed how housing was being provided in China. The resulting structure had led young people to access housing in ways that were very different from those of their parents’ generation (Deng, Hoekstra &amp; Elsinga, 2017). These observations prompted the following research question: What are the key factors defining young people’s opportunity to access housing, and how do these factors relate to China’s institutional changes during and after the market reform? The ensuing research has demonstrated that parental resources and intergenerational reciprocity are indispensable to the housing opportunity of young people, as home ownership has come to mediate the exchange of resources between generations. The marketization of the housing system , which dates back to 1978 and was ongoing at the time of study, was one of many institutional changes. In the housing domain, it entailed a drastic shift in tenure. The socialist system, which had been dominated by public renting (72% in 1978), was replaced by a system in which home ownership predominated (75% in 2011). That tenure shift could only be accomplished through reforms in other domains. Reforms in the fields of finance, land use, urban planning, and even in the Constitution created a ‘free market’ for developing and purchasing owner-occupied housing. In this study I have discerned four periods in China’s housing policy. These align with the main housing tenure(s) being provided: the welfare period (danwei public rental housing, 1949-1978); the dual period (subsidized and commercial home ownership, 1978-1998); the market period (commercial home ownership, 1999-2011); and the comprehensive period (commercial home ownership and public rental housing, after 2011). Each tenure has its own allocation procedures and particular criteria for deciding which applicants are most eligible and deserving. Thus, there were different mechanisms in each period for deciding which segment of the population would get better housing than the rest. Meanwhile, the structure of housing opportunity kept changing in the course of the reform. During the welfare period, people who were employed by powerful workunits and were loyal to the regime had better opportunities, since dwellings were allocated through a bureaucratic process that did not take the occupant’s income into account. During the market period, over 90% of the new housing provision was commercial home ownership. Therefore, I had expected the housing opportunities available to young Chinese people to show some attributes of a market economy: the higher one’s income, the better one’s housing. After the policy and literature review as the first step of my research, I introduced the market transition theory in the second step (Nee, 1989). I wanted to know whether housing opportunity in post-reform China actually did show the attributes of a market economy, measured by the significance of education, employment status, and income variables as predictors of home ownership ( Deng, Hoekstra &amp; Elsinga, 2016). This hypothesis was tested on data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2010 with a logistic regression model. Some of the explanatory variables referred to the position of young people and their parents in the socialist redistributive system (such as membership of the Chinese Communist Party, work units, and hukou), while others were indicative of the young people’s economic capacity (education, employment status, and income). According to the statistical modeling exercise, young people’s economic capacity was an insignificant variable for predicting their opportunity to access homeownership. Instead, the exercise demonstrated the relevance of two redistributive variables: Communist Party membership of their parents; and locality (local or non-local) of the hukou (which was automatically inherited from one’s mother but could be changed). People often needed a local urban hukou to enjoy the welfare amenities provided by municipal governments. The farther away one’s hukou was registered (and thus the longer the distance migrated), the less likely one was to become a homeowner. Given the crucial parental role that came to light in the second step, I then investigated how parents influenced young people’s housing opportunity and why. For that third step I turned to the two theories of ‘trade-offs’ (Kemeny, 2001; Kemeny, 2005) in the organization of societal institutions (the one between homeownership and the welfare state, the other between the welfare state and intergenerational exchange). The goal was to explore how housing, welfare, family, and gender interact in a particular context, namely post-reform China. By interviewing young adults and senior parents in Chongqing, I sought to understand the experience, perception, and rationale of intergenerational transfer for home ownership. The empirical evidence suggested that when the provision of public welfare was limited, senior parents were motivated to help arrange adult children’s homeownership in exchange for support, specifically for care in old age. This interpretation was substantiated by the divergent patterns of perception and behavior regarding intergenerational transfer for home ownership that were found between parents with either an urban or a rural background. Consistent with China’s dual welfare system, senior parents who lived in the countryside or had a background of rural-urban migration were found to have less pension and fewer other benefits than urbanites. As a result, the non-urban parents tended to view intergenerational transfer for children’s homeownership as either their ‘responsibility’ or a strategy to secure support in old age. In contrast, urban parents tended to view it as an act of parental love; consequently, the return they expected was merely emotional. The young recipients tended to acknowledge the implications of reciprocity, so they took upon themselves the obligation to return the favor. The feeling of indebtedness and the commitment to reciprocate were stronger among those who had received help from their rural parents, whose transfer often involved all of their wealth. When rural seniors with no pension transferred all their savings to a child, they would subsequently move into the child’s household; the latter assumed the limitless obligation to support them. Conversely, when urban parents transferred all their savings to a child, the latter did not assume that limitless obligation, since the parents would have a pension income in the future. As intergenerational transfer was seen to play an important role in young people’s housing opportunity and in elderly people’s care strategy, a closely related variable came into view: gender. Before the socialist system of welfare and housing was developed, the provision and inheritance of residential property was linked to customs regarding elderly care and ancestor worship, so property transfers were likewise carried out patrilineally. Accordingly, the parents of the bridegroom were presumed to accept the responsibility to provide housing for the newlyweds, transferring the property rights inter vivos or as a bequest. Furthermore, the bride was presumed to become a member of the bridegroom’s family and thus to care for his parents until death. These patrilineal patterns were somewhat counterbalanced by the socialist regime, as the state predominated in allocating housing resources. But when the private owner-occupation housing market was established after the reform, an old custom was resurrected: parents stepping up to help young people acquire housing. But this custom affected young men differently than young women. In multi-child families, parents made the preparations and eventually transferred their assets to their sons prior to or at the moment of marriage but provided no help, or at best offered interest-free loans, to daughters upon request. In single-child families, parents would not prepare an asset transfer for their daughters. They expected their daughter’s future husband and his family to provide for her unless their daughter’s future marriage partner choice proved incapable of doing so and the daughter requested some help. In a sense, women were in a privileged position: they were able to access housing services through marriage. By the same token, however, they were disadvantaged: women did not have equal opportunity to hold housing property rights and to thereby accumulate housing assets. The position of the women I interviewed for my research was quite diverse. Some, like an urban single child with good earning power and an intergenerational transfer, had attained independent home ownership. Some women owned their home together with their husbands. And some, like those with a rural immigrant background, were living in a rental dwelling or in a home owned by the husband. The empirical evidence supports the hypothesis I formulated when starting my research: that home ownership, the welfare state, and family and gender relationships are interconnected. I used the concept of social coordination to capture the interaction of the housing, welfare, family, and gender systems. According to the social coordination framework, when the housing system of a society is dominated by home ownership, this society might have the features of a limited welfare state, could engage in extensive intergenerational transfer, and could show a clear gender division. This framework has contributed to the theorization of intergenerational transfer for home ownership. In that light, homeownership-based welfare (Doling &amp; Ronald, 2010; Ronald &amp; Elsinga, 2012; Elsinga &amp; Hoekstra, 2015) can be understood from an intergenerational perspective. The social coordination framework is also a promising basis for further research on the relationship between housing systems and the wider social structure (Kemeny, 1992, 2001). What, then, were the structural features of housing opportunity for young Chinese people in post-reform China? Indeed, the development of a housing market and the massive supply of commercial housing gave some of them the opportunity to enjoy better housing conditions and even own property at an earlier stage of life compared to senior generations. However, by the second decade of the twenty-first century, their housing opportunity did not correspond to the status they had achieved in the market economy. One contribution of my research may be to bring a housing perspective into the debate about how the transition from state socialism to a market economy changes the structure of incentive opportunity. Unlike the kind of housing opportunity research that considers the whole urban population, research with a narrower focus -- on young adults from both urban and rural backgrounds during the 2010s -- suggests a much more limited effect of the market allocation of housing. Moreover, as I have pointed out, the current structure of housing opportunity was a result of the policy bias in favour of home ownership (Ronald, 2008). On that basis, I have argued that housing opportunity can be improved by adapting the current housing policy to develop a healthy rental market and by creating a tenure-neutral housing system in the future.",Error fetching abstract,,both,,both,,https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/abe/article/download/2529/2791

context, much of the new interest in girls has occurred under the rubric ‘the girl child’, which has become an increasingly common phrase on international and national platforms. This paper, based largely on field and documentary research across East, South and Southeast Asia, suggests that this platform has not translated into effective, sustained or transformative national programmes or local projects in support of girls. It also argues that the cause of girls might be served better by an emphasis on girls' rights embedded in frameworks that both gender entitlements and expectations of children and take campaigns directly into the familial environment.

I explore how changes in the nature of wealth and the division of labor could have induced transitions among three stable network structures: symmetric networks with little political hierarchy or economic inequality, asymmetrical networks with political hierarchy but little economic inequality and asymmetrical networks with both hierarchy and inequality. As in Kets, Iyengar, Sethi and Bowles (2009), the distribution of benefits on these networks is limited by the feasible coalitions that may withdraw from the existing network, where membership in a coalition is restricted to those who are within distance k in the network. A distribution of benefits on a network is stable if no feasible coalition can benefit by deviating from the network. In addition to k, the key determinant in the mapping from economic conditions to the above three equilibrium networks is the extent of intermediation decay in network benefits and the degree of intergenerational transmission of a population's important forms of wealth. Ethnographic and archaeological data from forager, horticultural and herding populations illustrate the model.",,,theoretical,,theoretical,,

20th century to give insights into biomedical as well as wider social issues. However, the biomedical and social science fields have developed concepts in parallel without much cross-fertilisation. For the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) biomedical scientific discourse, the focus has largely been on pro- and retrospective epidemiological cohort studies of risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and of underlying mechanisms such as epigenetic processes. In parallel, numerous long-term studies within the social sciences have provided strong evidence on how generations interact and the changing social relations and family structures over the past century. This article explores how the life-course concepts from these fields can be combined, arguing for a re-invention of a social medicine approach to family health in communities based on a long-term, diachronic perspective. The life-course perspective within DOHaD emerged from the confluence of several lines of biomedical research. Retrospective epidemiological studies of cohorts of individuals characterised from birth led to the perception that prenatal development, measured using the proxy of birthweight, was associated with risk of NCDs such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes many decades later.1 This led to a plethora of studies in experimental animals of many species, and insights drawn from the fields of developmental and evolutionary biology, which revealed that the prenatal processes leading to NCD risk in humans later in the life course were at one end of a spectrum of adaptive processes normally occurring in early life which are not necessarily pathological.2 This contrasted with predominant views that NCD risk was a combination of genetic predisposition and unhealthy adult lifestyle, a controversial proposition which begged a mechanistic explanation for a phenomenon with such a long latency between initiating stimulus and overt response. Possible mechanisms were largely provided by renewed research in the field of epigenetics, initially in animals but more recently in human cohorts, which has revealed how a range of developmental environmental factors can influence gene expression and thus an individual's phenotype and responses to later lifestyle challenges.3 These insights made a life-course perspective fundamental to current DOHaD concepts for several reasons. First, it became clear that even normative adaptive changes in phenotype arising from epigenetic processes operating during early development could be associated with greater later risk of NCDs if environmental factors such as food and physical activity levels changed across the life course: this is the so-called Mismatch concept.4 Secondly, in another dogma-challenging series of discoveries, it became clear that epigenetic changes induced in one generation could be passed through either male or female gamete to the offspring, or even to subsequent generations.5 Consequently, one can visualise the life course as a circle incorporating each stage of life: fetal life, infancy, early childhood, school age, adolescence and fertile age (including the preconception period). Within this circle, positive and negative events at any stage of the life course may have an impact on subsequent stages of the life course of an individual and also have effects on the life course of subsequent generations. Old age is the exception, where the impacts of events are not transmitted to the next generation (Figure 1).6 Such models have led to considerations of the most appropriate interventions and timepoints in order to reduce the risk of NCDs in the DOHaD context. Increasingly, the focus of attention has been on early pregnancy and even the preconception period, as epigenetic processes operate in the early embryo to influence development. In addition, as a substantial proportion of pregnancies are unplanned, interventions to promote healthy early development may be necessary before conception.7 Moreover, the paternal transmission of risk makes it important to involve both parents in risk reduction for their child.8 In parallel to the biomedical life-course discourse described above, there has been a similar growing focus within the social sciences. Most of this research encompassed large-scale, longitudinal studies conducted in the USA and other high-income countries and documenting evolving family structures due to changing norms and socio-demographic trends such as increased divorce rate and longevity. The traditional nuclear family has become less common and multigenerational relationships increasingly important and diverse in structure and function.9 In addition, it has been shown how the 'life course of individuals is embedded and shaped by the historical times and places they experience over their lifetime'.10 Examples include the Second World War or the COVID-19 pandemic, which constitute a common reference frame for persons of the same generation. Not surprisingly, family relationships have profound influence on the family members. The links between family relationships and well-being differ according to marital, intergenerational and sibling relationships, and gender and ethnicity play a role.11 Canedo-Garcia et al12 reviewed the impact of interventions within intergenerational social relations, stating that 'participation in interventions of this type yields benefits in terms of improving older adults' health and well-being by facilitating continued intellectual or physical activity in the elderly, and it simultaneously contributes to the encouraging of values and behaviours in children and to the construction of identity among adolescents'. Figure 2 shows the social perspective superimposed on the biomedical life-course cycle in terms of the potential social interactions between parents and offspring (one-generation gap), and grandparents and grandchildren (two-generation gap). These social relationships may offer unidirectional support or mutually beneficial bidirectional support. As time progresses, they may change from unidirectional to bidirectional (eg when a child grows up and may provide support to the adults), or vice versa (eg as a family member ages and switches from being a resource to mainly needing care and support). Both the biomedical and social life-course perspectives contain elements of chronological progression where exposures early in life have important bearings on responses to later events. However, in addition intergenerational social interaction bridges generations and thereby shortcuts the chronology (running counter to the chronological direction). Combining the biomedical and the social life-course perspectives into a bio-social paradigm leads to new insights. It does not change the biomedical rationale that the preconception period and promoting healthy development during the first 1000 days from conception to age two years are critical for a healthy later trajectory. But including the strong social science evidence base expands the well-known notion that family and social networks are important to a more comprehensive understanding of how these inter-relationships develop over time and constitute important supportive structures. Figure 3 visualises the bio-social life-course perspective, using a notion of 'bio-social capital' to indicate the combination of phenotypic fitness and health (induced, eg by early epigenetic processes) with social resources (the sum of neuro-cognitive and emotional skills, educational achievements, social networks and care including close family, relatives and friends, economic resources and environmental factors). This is a refinement on previous life-course models, which used the concepts of a critical period for induction of an at-risk phenotype, an accumulation of risk or a chain of risk.13 Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902) is among many other things credited as the founder of social medicine which, in broad terms, focuses on the interaction between patterns of diseases and risk factors on the one hand and socio-demographic and economic factors (currently called social determinants) on the other. The bio-social life-course perspective fits within this discourse. However, it also adds an essential point. At its core, the life-course perspective draws attention to the very long-term causal relationships and mechanisms spanning decades and sometime generations. Whereas traditional epidemiological and social sciences often apply a short-term focus, the bio-social life course entails a long-term view—a shift from synchronic to diachronic social medicine. These terms have been adapted from linguistics: the former denotes the combination of events occurring simultaneously at a point in time, whereas the latter refers to events occurring sequentially over time. Such thinking has profound implications for public health research. The long and intricate causality chains of intertwined biomedical and social mechanisms can only be explored through long-term, large-scale cohort studies measuring both biological and socio-demographic variables. Hence, notwithstanding the relevance of short-term trials, only long-term studies can fully capture the distant outcomes of a given intervention and the intricate bio-social contextual factors. As mentioned above, most social life-course research has been conducted in high-income countries. It is essential that similar research be carried out in low–middle-income settings, where differing cultures, religions, kinship structures, healthcare systems and stages of demographic transition provide alternative conditions. Though daily clinical practice will probably remain the same, there are also practical implications of the bio-social life-course perspective. Thus, there is now clear evidence confirming previous intuitions that appropriate and adequate interventions early in life not only have immediate benefits but also profound long-term implications and that such support for 'nurturing care'14 should integrate biomedical and social elements. In recent decades, the life-course perspective has led to important insights within DOHaD biomedical as well as social sciences, although little cross-fertilisation has occurred. A combined bio-social life-course perspective to bring together these two large, but hitherto distinct, bodies of evidence transforms social medicine from a synchronic to a diachronic discipline, suggesting new interventions to reduce common chronic diseases and shifting emphasis from treatment to prevention. We contend that this paradigm shift should guide research as well as practice to look beyond immediate proximal outcomes and consider distal outcomes affecting future lives and generations. None declared. Both authors have contributed to all phases of the paper from conceptualisation to writing and approve the final version.","The life-course concept has been widely used during the 20th century to give insights into biomedical as well as wider social issues. However, the biomedical and social science fields have developed concepts in parallel without much cross-fertilisation. For the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) biomedical scientific discourse, the focus has largely been on pro- and retrospective epidemiological cohort studies of risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and of underlying mechanisms such as epigenetic processes. In parallel, numerous long-term studies within the social sciences have provided strong evidence on how generations interact and the changing social relations and family structures over the past century. This article explores how the life-course concepts from these fields can be combined, arguing for a re-invention of a social medicine approach to family health in communities based on a long-term, diachronic perspective.",M.

At the same time, the Italian labour market is characterized by a low degree of intragenerational mobility, a disadvantage for higher educated people in terms of the time needed to get their first job, but quite a reward for educational attainment in terms of social desirability of the first occupation obtained. Therefore, the role of the family in protecting young people looking for their first job is extremely relevant. As a matter of fact, family protection allows highly educated Italians not to compete for lower occupational positions and to wait for a good job to be offered. However, families markedly differ in terms of the protection they can offer. The article shows that, net of income resources available, families of the high service class better protect their children while they are looking for their first job and that, during the first stages of children’s working career, they tend to promote children residential autonomy much more than families of other social classes do.",,,empirical,,empirical,,

We therefore augment the standard overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic labor productivity and longevity risk in that we account for gender and marital status. We simulate the abolition of pay-as-you-go pension payments, calculate the resulting intergenerational welfare changes and isolates aggregate efficiency effects for singles and families by means of compensating transfers. In accordance with previous studies that take into account transitional dynamics, we find that abolishing social security creates significant efficiency losses. Most importantly, however, we show that singles are substantially worse off from a shut-down of old-age payments compared to married couples. A decomposition of the efficiency loss reveals that this difference can be almost exclusively attributed to the insurance role of the family with respect to longevity risk. Since a married individual inherits her spouse’s wealth after his death and the likelihood that both partners reach a very old age is relatively small, marriage serves as an insurance device against longevity risk for the surviving partner.",Error fetching abstract,,false,,theoretical,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/128358/1/cesifo1_wp5655.pdf

It is unclear, however, the extent to which important childhood experiences, such as family structure and transitions, shapes opportunity paths and eventual attainment later in adulthood. The intergenerational transmission literature suggests little if any role of family structure in later attainment, while family scholars and demographers find more compelling evidence that childhood family structures and transitions are influential in adulthood. We argue that both perspectives may be identifying selectivity processes that help explain potential links between families of origin and differences in opportunities to attain education, careers, and status. We then provide suggestions for future work in each of these scholarly traditions to help untangle both the degree to which family structure does or does not affect adult attainment and whether selectivity is the key explanation for any such relationships.",,Mikaela J.

social trends have drastically influenced the structure of African American families. Along with structural changes, there have also occured transitions in the roles of grandmother caregivers. Historically, the African American grandmother has played important roles within the extended family network. She has been guardian and caregiver for her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and as well as fictive kin. She represents wisdom and strength while serving as keeper of the family values, and conveyer of African American culture. It was the grandmother who reminded family members of their obligations and goals. African American grandmothers have played major roles in the socialization of children and the stabilization of families. The strength and resilience of African American grandparenthood is imbedded in her ability to withstand the harshness of slavery and oppression, her ability to perform multiple roles, her love of family, and her strong religious beliefs. The African American grandmother has been appropriately described by E. Franklin Frazier as the guardian of the generations. African American families, where the grandmother is caregiver for grandchildren, are increasing rapidly. This increase is most prevalent in low income, inner city, African American communities. The problems precipitating the need for grandparent caregivers, contribute to family disruptions and leave dependent children without adequate adult supervision. Because of the financial burden, many grandmothers are forced to give up their jobs, and some must return to work after retirement. In addition to taking care of their own children, they may take care of two or three generations, as well as ailing elderly parents and other family members. Since 1970, there has been an increase in the number of families headed by grandparents. According to the U.S. Census, African American children are more likely to live in the home of a grandparent than are Whites or Hispanics. In 1992, 12 percent of African American children lived in the home of their grandparents, in comparison to 4% White and 6% Hispanic children. In African American families, it is common for grandparents to assume responsibility for the care of grandchildren or great-grandchildren when a parent is no longer able or willing. Intergenerational African American families, where the grandmother is the primary caregiver, are increasing rapidly. Over the past 2 decades, researchers and policy makers have shown considerable interest in the magnitude of the increase among grandparent caregivers. This interest has stimulated a proliferation of research on a wide range of topics. However, in spite of the increased interest, there has been very little research focusing exclusively on African American grandmothers, who are confronted with a different, if not more complicated types of issues. This article will highlight traditional family roles, demographic characteristics, reasons for assuming the caregiver role, burdens and blessings, and psychological responses to custodial caregiving. Traditional family roles of African American grandmothers From the early beginnings of this country to the present, older African American women have been instrumental in their roles as caregivers and nurturers in extended families. However, it was not until after the Civil War that a clear delineation of the grandmother's role began to emerge. The strong character of older African American women, and the significance of their roles, is undisputed in the literature (Billingsley, 1992; Blassingame, 1972; Du Bois, 1975; Frazier, 1939; Frazier, 1957; Genovese, 1976; Gutman, 1976; Hill, 1971; Ladner, 1971; Powdermaker, 1969; Quarles, 1954; Sterling, 1984). In his appraisal of older African American women, Du Bois writes, perhaps even higher than strength and art loom human sympathy and sacrifice as characteristics of Negro womenhood (Darkwater, 1775; p. …",,,false,,false,,

[1057]}",en,False,closed,"Contemporary study of the Arab world covers a variety of topics including economic development, energy security, demographic changes, gender inequality, ethnic and sectarian divisions, and regional conflicts. Civilian-military relations, however, have not been adequately analyzed despite the significant impact this relation has on domestic stability and national and regional security. Hicham Bou Nassif’s study, Endgames: Military Response to Protest in Arab Autocracies, is a welcome effort to fill this void.The central question Bou Nassif seeks to answer is: “Why was the military reaction to the upheavals in several Arab countries that started in 2011 (so-called Arab Spring) strikingly dissimilar?” (4). He rightly argues that no transition from autocracy to democracy is possible if the armed forces remain cohesive and loyal to the political establishment. Tyranny can and does last for years and decades when the coercive apparatus is committed to the status quo. Stated differently, military defection shifts the correlation of forces in favor of widespread civilian uprisings against autocrats and protests can reach and sustain critical mass only if the military refuses to defend the ruling regimes.Against this background, Bou Nassif argues that civil-military relations in autocracies where leaders fear being overthrown by officers center upon “coup-proofing,” in other words, a set of measures governments take to prevent putsches. Yet, in prioritizing regime survival over national security autocrats weaken the military forces’ capabilities to defend their countries against foreign enemies. Historically, the survival of Arab military leaders depended far more on coup prevention than on optimizing the armed forces’ capabilities.In explaining his argument, Bou Nassif highlights the fact that in any country armed forces are not unified actors and often have conflicting interests and perspectives. The book’s first chapter details the “vertical cleavages,” namely, intergenerational dynamics in the officer corps, and, the “horizontal cleavages,” that is, intragenerational dynamics in the officer corps. These interlocking cleavages raise a key question—how can military leaders articulate and execute a coup-proof strategy? The analysis suggests four tools: (1) ideology and fostering shared aversions; (2) promoting the material interests of the military elite; (3) counterbalancing; and (4) divide-and-rule tactics. These tools are not mutually exclusive and various combination of them are usually utilized.In the third chapter Bou Nassif examines this coup-proofing strategy in Egypt under President Gamal Abdel Nasser and in Syria under the Baʿath Party from early 1950s to 1970s. The main takeaway is that Egyptian and Syrian military leaders were determined to prevent any military coup against their regimes and implemented different combinations of the tools mentioned in the previous chapter. Bou Nassif then follows the two countries into the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century in Egypt under presidents Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak and in Syria under presidents Hafez al-Asad and Bashar al-Asad. The analysis suggests that in both Egypt and Syria senior military commanders benefitted financially from allegiance to the political leaders. This accumulated wealth at the hands of military commanders, however, created a gap between them and the younger officers because money never trickled down. This large gap explains how the Egyptian and Syrian military forces responded to the 2011 political upheavals.Bou Nassif addresses the differences between the Egyptian and Syrian armies’ responses to the 2011 popular uprisings. The Egyptian military did not fight to keep President Mubarak in power and, more or less, accepted a temporary regime change. Bou Nassif provides two possible explanations: (1) senior military leaders resented President Mubarak’s efforts to groom his son, Gamal, to succeed him; or (2) the United States, Egypt’s closest international ally, exerted pressure on the military not to crack down on the popular protests. On the other hand, a significant segment of the Syrian military has maintained its loyalty to President Asad and kept fighting against his opponents. The strong sectarian identity in the Syrian society and policy is the driving force behind this loyalty. Both Hafez and Bashar al-Asad used sectarianism instrumentally to unify ʿAlawi ranks around them.Tunisia and Libya are the focus of chapter 5. Unlike Egypt and Syria, the military was not central to the independence of Tunisia. Lacking the legitimacy Al-Habib Bourguiba enjoyed, Zein Al-Abidin Ben Ali counted on the ruling party, which he transformed into an intelligence network devoid of ideological commitment. He also relied on the interior ministry and the sprawling network of security organizations it controlled. Eventually, Ben Ali was unable to count on the military to kill civilians in order to save his rule and keep him in power. In neighboring Libya, on the other hand, Muʾammar al-Qaddafi ethnically stacked the special units in the armed forces, pitted them against regular troops stationed in the eastern regions, promoted the material interests of his favorite generals, and fostered paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies to counterbalance the military. These privileged units were ready to kill civilians and defend the regime in 2011, but the rest of the armed forces were not equally motivated and instead chose to defect and melt into the population. This disparity within the security apparatus and armed forces provides a strong explanation as to the nature of the ongoing civil war in Libya.Endgames: Military Response to Protest in Arab Autocracies provides a thorough theoretical analysis of civilian-military relations in the Arab world and how military regimes have sought to consolidate their power. It also analyzes and compares how the Egyptian, Syrian, Tunisian, and Libyan armed forces have responded to popular uprisings since 2011. Given space limitation, the volume does not address civil-military relations in other Arab countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Jordan, the other North African countries, or the Gulf Cooperation Council states. It would also be interesting to compare civilian-military relations in the Arab world with those in the non-Arab Middle Eastern powers, like Iran, Israel, and Turkey. The book also does not pay enough attention to the role played by regional and international actors in supporting or opposing military leaders. Finally, the analysis does not address how proponents of democratic transformation in the Arab world should counter these “coup-proofing” strategies articulated and implemented by several military and civilian leaders in the Arab world.Arab militaries are major players in the contemporary politics of the Arab world. For decades the dynamics of the interactions between military and civilian elites and their relations with other centers of powers within their societies have been overlooked and inadequately studied. This book is a welcome contribution to fill this gap.",,G. Bahgat,false,,false,,

essays in this edited book, a supplement of the journal Population and Development Review, represent a peer-reviewed selection from a large number of essays on the theme of population and public policy.Although the title hints that this may be a festschrift, it is not.The essays fall loosely into Paul Demeny's wide-ranging intellectual interests, but he and his work per se are not the focus here.Each of the essays is a state-of-the-art article that could fit well into the pages of the Population and Development Review.And each focuses, albeit broadly, on issues and challenges of population and public policy.The book opens with a substantive introductory reflection by Geoffrey McNicoll on ""post-transition demography,"" where he builds a richly textured stage for the chapters that follow.His reflective essay goes far beyond his essay's title, much like this volume itself.McNicoll fruitfully trolls the intellectual past, including works by John Maynard Keynes and Oswald Spengler, as well as the future of generational and societal quality and environmental challenges.He presents an intricate tapestry that includes population but goes far deeper into social and economic contexts than demographers typically do.For instance, he organizes his chapter into four themes: generational succession, quality of society and life, mobility both social and geographic, and identity.This is a long way from the simple demographic focus on fertility, mortality, and migration.In the end, he quotes Demeny's 1986 ""Presidential Address to the Population Assocation of America,"" which asks scholars, particularly demographers, to lift our ambitions above the humdrum to envision the kind of society we would like to be part of, and then to imagine how a demographic constitution would fit into it.A tall order indeed, but seemingly more worthy than perpetual handwringing about demographic abundance or decline that seem not amenable to policy levers.The book is then organized into six sections: Intergenerational relations; Low fertility, population aging and the body politic; Policy and programs in China; Policy and programs in Africa; Environment, technology and wealth; and Population theory and measurement.Each of the twenty chapters following the McNicoll introduction-many by well established and respected scholars from different disciplines and different parts of the world, offers new thought-provoking insights.For example, the two chapters in the intergenerational relations section (by Ronald Lee and by Nancy Folbre and Douglas Wolf) explore intergenerational transfers (IGTs) and the intergenerational welfare state, respectively.Lee takes us on a tour of the many ways IGTs have been fundamental to societies, and how population aging, a low fertility regime, and the welfare state pose challenges for IGTs.Folbre and Wolf look at the US ""partial"" (their term) welfare state, asking how it came to involve many IGTs, how public/private IGTs interact, and what would happen if public IGTs were privatized.They conclude that significantly more conceptual work needs to be undertaken before a framework of intergenerational equity can be called into play-with which this reviewer fully concurs (see McDaniel 2004McDaniel , 2008)).Both of these",,S.

Retiring physicians take with them a wealth of knowledge, wisdom, and expertise and can feel a loss of identity, lack of fulfillment, and reduced social connectedness after leaving the institution. To address this, a novel educational program providing retired physicians with renewed educational roles was implemented in 2018 within a university-associated pediatric department. This study sought to explore the retired physicians’ experiences in this new intergenerational program, including their motivations to reengage as educators after retirement. Method The authors designed this study using qualitative description. Semistructured interviews were conducted in the Department of Pediatrics of McGill University in 2019 with retired physicians who participated in the educational program’s inaugural year. Role theory and psychosocial development theory were used to design the interview guide and inform the thematic analysis. Iterative analysis of the interview transcripts was deductive and inductive. Results Of the 8 retired physicians who participated in the program’s first cohort, 7 participated in this study. Analysis of the data yielded 4 main themes: a challenging shift to retirement, a desire for reengagement after retirement, role dissonance, and gaining by giving. The retired physicians were motivated to engage as educators. Although they experienced some discomfort in their new nonclinical roles, they described their experiences as fulfilling, with benefits such as intellectual stimulation, social connectedness, and a sense of purpose. Conclusions Retired physicians’ motivations to reengage academically and their experiences contributing to educational activities in this program highlight the importance of supporting physicians during the transition to retirement and establishing formal programs to engage retired physicians as educators.","Purpose Physician retirement has important impacts on medical learners as well as retiring physicians themselves.

pandemic uprooted assumptions on which societies function, and profoundly changed daily life. Because the disease disproportionately affected people older than 65 years, the pandemic generated a sense of vulnerability in many older people who were previously enjoying a newfound sense of healthy ageing. Older adults face substantially higher mortality rates from COVID-19 compared with their younger counterparts and, even when they recover, present with more severe symptoms. Older people are also vulnerable to indirect impacts of COVID-19, including food insecurity, social isolation, and financial instability. These issues are even more devastating among residents of long-term care facilities that have become hotspots for COVID-19 transmission and mortality. Amidst the pandemic, we are living through a demographic transition reshaping the global population. Between 2019 and 2050, the number of people aged 65 years or older will increase from 703 million to 1·5 billion, and by 2050, more than two-thirds of the total population of older adults will occur in less developed countries.1UN Department of Economic and Social AffairsWorld population ageing.https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/ageing/WorldPopulationAgeing2019-Highlights.pdf/Date: 2019Date accessed: August 23, 2020Google Scholar Although it has been clear for many years that we need to change the ways we live to accommodate longer lives, COVID-19 laid bare just how unprepared we are to empower and protect ageing populations during crises. We argue societies must undergo a shift in how we think about global ageing, and remap the life course to look at unique opportunities to foster longevity. The Stanford Center on Longevity launched the New Map of Life (NMOL) initiative in September, 2018, and later convened a global conference on the same topic in Bellagio, Italy, in September 2019. Experts identified six principles to guide long-lived societies on a global scale: (1) new roles and opportunities must be created so that people experience purpose, belonging, and worth; (2) education must be a lifelong pursuit; (3) working longer should occur in multigenerational contexts; (4) money: opportunities to earn and save must be available throughout life to ensure financial security; (5) advances in the science of ageing must be distributed broadly in the population; and (6) physical health and the prevention of disease is critical to achieving the promise longevity presents.2Stanford Center on LongevityA global agenda for a new map of life.http://longevity.stanford.edu/a-global-agenda-for-a-new-map-of-life/Date accessed: August 22, 2020Google Scholar The NMOL initiative rests on the presumption that longer lives are not inherently problematic, but rather reflect a mismatch between the cultures guiding us and the length of our lives. Although not guaranteed, added years can enable people to cultivate more meaningful lives. COVID-19 has taught us important lessons relevant to each NMOL principle. We learned how purpose, belonging, and worth are threatened for people older than 65 years, especially when public health recommendations insist on isolation from friends and loved ones (principle 1). We have seen how education is critical so that communities and individuals stay updated about COVID-19 and preventive measures (principle 2). We witnessed just how different workforce experiences are, as non-manual (so-called white collar) workers retreated to working from home, while manual (so-called blue collar) workers remained on the frontline and were particularly vulnerable to job loss (principles 3 and 4). We experienced how disruptions in scientific advances fostering health equity, such as vaccination distributions, can have detrimental impacts worldwide (principle 5). And, finally, the pandemic underscored the importance of physical resilience, and demonstrated how older communities and individuals living with comorbidities are more threatened by COVID-19 health impacts than the younger population (principle 6). Societies can learn lessons from the pandemic and develop systems-level changes that align with NMOL principles to better respond to COVID-19 and future crises. For example, in Singapore, the government had been preparing for an ageing population for years, and because of the Asian experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, was prepared to respond efficiently to COVID-19 threats. In addition to protective health measures, the Singaporean Government responded to COVID-19 with initiatives that foster job security, such as the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. The SkillsFuture programme, which provides workplace skills training, is being expanded and subsidised to empower individuals and increase older peoples' employability. In addition, the initiative is hosting virtual career fairs and generating job opportunities for Singaporeans, with financial incentives for employers to hire workers aged older than 40 years.3Skillsfuture & Workforce SingaporeSGUnited jobs and skills.https://www.ssg-wsg.gov.sg/sgunitedjobsandskills.html/Date accessed: August 22, 2020Google Scholar These workforce and learning opportunities enable Singaporeans to remain purposeful, educated, and working (principles 1–4 and 6). Another strategy that communities are using to build long-lived societies is fostering intergenerational connectivity, which builds purpose, belonging, worth, and mutual respect. In Zimbabwe, since a pilot first began in 2007, grandmother health providers provide mental health therapy for community members at so-called friendship benches embedded across the country. These have been shown to decrease psychological morbidity.4Chibanda D Weiss HA Verhey R et al.Effect of a primary care-based psychological intervention on symptoms of common mental disorders in Zimbabwe: a randomized clinical trial.JAMA. 2016; 316: 2618-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar During the COVID-19 pandemic, grandmothers continue to serve communities through friendship benches using social distancing or technologies such as WhatsApp. This type of intergenerational connectivity with proper social distancing is timely, because research indicates that in most communities younger adults are more likely to experience psychological distress than older adults during COVID-19 (principles 1 and 6).5Czeisler MÉ Lane RI Petrosky E et al.Mental health, substance use, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic — United States, June 24–30, 2020.MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2020; 69: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar NMOL implementation should involve the wide dissemination of such interventions, and presents an opportunity to cultivate a better world for after the pandemic. Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) face additional challenges due to limited resources and the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Associated risks of COVID-19 are disrupting global health programmes that target disease prevention and routine immunisations.6Hogan AB Jewell BL Sherrard-Smith E et al.Potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study.Lancet Glob Health. 2020; 8: e1132-e1141Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 7Abbas K Procter SR van Zandvoort K et al.Routine childhood immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa: a benefit–risk analysis of health benefits versus excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Lancet Glob Health. 2020; 8: e1264-e1272Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar NCDs are growing in LMICs because of shifts to a sedentary lifestyle, changing diet, increases in smoking, and population ageing. Not only can NCD comorbidities worsen COVID-19 outcomes, but interrupted health services can hinder populations' access to NCD treatment. Countries worldwide can partner with LMICs to build health systems capacity targeting interventions aligning with the NMOL, ensuring that reductions in both communicable and non-communicable diseases improve physical health (principle 6). The COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting the interconnectedness of the world, and how some populations are especially vulnerable to the pandemic's impacts. Protecting, while empowering, the elderly is vital to healthy ageing during COVID-19. The NMOL should be integrated into societies' responses to address COVID-19 and carried forward into communities' rebuilding. While the adoption of the NMOL will differ depending on the local cultural context, societies can learn shared objectives and challenges from one another to respond to COVID-19 and future crises. Government-led policies, with coordinated messages and targeted interventions, should be at the forefront of these efforts. It is essential that research targeting COVID-19 treatments and prevention are accessible in all countries, and does not discriminate against an ageing population (principle 5). Ultimately, these principles can guide societies to develop purpose, belonging, and worth throughout the life course, in a world where ageing populations will comprise a growing proportion of our global community.

practices and with larger debates in the institution. These debates are understood as a 'battlefield of knowledge', whose form and outcomes are structured but not determined by the political economy of the Bank. Understanding the debates this way has implications for research on the ways in which development discourses are produced and enacted, as well as for more specific discussions of the place of social capital in development studies. The article concludes with a reflection on implications of these debates for future research, policy, and practice. Notes We leave open the question of whether discursive shifts and any attendant organisational changes are (or are not) more readily accomplished in other types of organisations. Harriss's book invokes Ferguson's argument in the notes to its introduction and its conclusion [ Harriss, 2002 Harriss J 2002 De-Politicizing Development: The World Bank and Social Capital London: Anthem Press [Google Scholar] : 2, 118, 124n]. The rise is also attributed to less than scholarly motivations among academics and researchers who see in social capital a language they may use to ensure the publication of their work. Of course in other ways the Bank is an acutely political institution, with acutely political effects. Task managers in the Bank are those people responsible for ensuring the inception, execution and completion of an activity.

Many also still identify with the core of the infrastructure argument too. On the intellectual history of social capital, see Woolcock [ 1998 Woolcock, M. 1998. Social Capital and Economic Development: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis and Policy Framework. Theory and Society, 27(2): 151–208. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ] and Farr [ 2004 Farr J 2004 Social Capital: a Conceptual History Political Theory (forthcoming) [Google Scholar] ]. Putnam, personal communication [June 2002]. In the early 1990s, Putnam was a member of Serageldin's advisory group, which met periodically to keep the vice president abreast of the latest thinking in academia, and was also in quite regular communication with Bruno. Serageldin hosted several high-level meetings/seminars of senior academics and Bank staff on social capital, which culminated in a collection of new and 'classic' (and sometimes critical) papers co-edited with the development economist, Partha Dasgupta [see Dasgupta and Serageldin, 2000 Dasgupta P Serageldin I (eds.) 2000 Social Capital: A Multifaceted Perspective Washington DC: The World Bank [Google Scholar] ]. Some 19 people made up the core team, dozens more were regularly active, and some 300 attended an international seminar organised by the Group in 1992 [ Bhatnagar and Williams, 1992 Bhatnagar B Williams AC (eds.) 1992 Participatory Development and the World Bank: Potential Directions for Change Washington, DC: World Bank, Discussion Paper No.183 [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] ]. By 1996, over 200 staff and consultants were involved in contributing simply to one publication of the group [World Bank, 1996 World Bank 1996a Participation Sourcebook Washington DC: World Bank [Google Scholar] a: xii]. This is not to deny the existence of long-standing traditions in the social sciences that would have something to say about development alternatives. It is, however, the case that the language of these social sciences had then, and still has, little purchase inside the institution. Examples here include: Uphoff [ 1992 Uphoff N 1992 Monitoring and Evaluating Popular Participation in World Bank-Assisted Projects', pp.135–53 in B Bhatnagar and A. C. Williams (eds.) [Google Scholar] ], Bebbington [ Bebbington and Perreault, 1999 Bebbington, AJ and Perreault, T. 1999. Social Capital and Development in Highland Ecuador. Economic Geography, 75: 395–418.

The World Bank and Social Capital: Lessons from Ten Rural Development Projects in the Philippines and Mexico. Policy Sciences, 33: 399–419.

It should be noted that significant parallel developments were taking place within mainstream economics [see Platteau, 2000 Platteau J-P 2000 Institutions, Social Norms, and Economic Development Amsterdam: Harwood Academic Publishers [Google Scholar] ] at the same time that 'social capital' was rising in popularity within the non-economic social sciences. Institutions [ North, 1990 North D 1990 Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance New York: Cambridge University Press [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] ], networks [ Borjas, 1992 Borjas, G. 1992. Ethnic Capital and Intergenerational Mobility. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107(1): 123–50. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ], norms [ Platteau, 1994 Platteau, J-P. 1994. Behind the Market Stage where Real Societies Exist – Part II: the Role of Moral Norms. Journal of Development Studies, 30(4): 753–817. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ], and culture [ Greif, 1994 Greif, A. 1994. Cultural Beliefs and the Organization of Society: a Historical and Theoretical Reflection on Collectivist and Individualist Societies. Journal of Political Economy, 102(5): 912–50. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ] (re-) entered the development economics literature through articles in prestigious journals by scholars concerned with the 'failure' of many east European transition countries, the persistence of poverty in a world of plenty, and the remarkable success of certain East Asian economies and particular ethnic diaspora communities. The strategising of the Bank's social scientists, now couching their arguments in social capital terms, thus found a more receptive audience in the mid-1990s among orthodox development economists than they would have in previous decades. Steer was Director of the Environment Department, within which the Social Policy Division then sat. Each existed under Serageldin's Vice-Presidency. The creation of the group had much to do with the urging of Davis and support of Steer, who chaired the group. A later initiative to ask the director of the Research Group to write a paper on social capital and poverty was another such strategic move; see Collier [ 1998 Collier P 1998 Social Capital and Poverty Social Capital Initiative Working Paper No.4, Washington, DC: The World Bank [Google Scholar] ]. Narayan was introduced to Pritchett some years earlier through her research assistant at the time, Jonathan Isham, now a prominent economist of social capital in his own right based at Middlebury College, Vermont. This study was later published in Economic Development and Cultural Change as Narayan and Pritchett [ 1999 Narayan, D and Pritchett, L. 1999. Cents and Sociability: Household Income and Social Capital in Rural Tanzania. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 47(4): 871–97. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ]. Trust funds are pockets of money that exist in the Bank, financed by different member governments, and for which Bank staff can apply to cover work not financed by core budget. This pattern in which member governments use grant resources to support work of particular interest to the government, and in many cases related to that government's own beliefs about development, has also been documented for the case of Japan and its support for the research that went into the Asian Miracle study [ Wade, 1996 Wade, R. 1996. Japan, the World Bank, and the Art of Paradigm Maintenance: The East Asian Miracle in Political Perspective. New Left Review, 217: 3–36. [Google Scholar] ]. Somewhat differently to the case Wade describes, the Norwegian officials did not advocate for this research – rather they endorsed a proposal that came from the Social Policy Division. More generally, the Social Development Department (and the earlier Social Policy Division) have enjoyed support from Scandinavian donors – whose own foreign aid programmes, and indeed own notions of state–society relationships at home, have emphasised an important role for participation, civil society and popular organisation. Notably, a Danish Trust Fund supported the second round of social capital research in the Social Development Department, the so-called Social Capital Initiative. There is still considerable resistance to participatory poverty assessments (for example, Robb [ 2001 Robb C 2001 Can the Poor Influence Policy? Participatory Poverty Assessments in the Developing World (Revised edition), Washington DC: The International Monetary Fund [Google Scholar] ]) among some senior economists at the World Bank. Staff who, notably, had earlier been members of the Participation Group See Denning [ 2000 Denning S 2000 The Springboard: How Storytelling Ignites Action in Knowledge-Era Organizations Woburn, MA: Butterworth-Heinemann [Google Scholar] ] for an account of the strategising and 'storytelling' required to introduce even relatively benign issues into the World Bank. There is a certain tendency to hire in consultants to do the reading (that is, write 'literature reviews') for permanent staff. Somewhat ironically (and perhaps counterproductively for this group) it is this same website that has served as a (if not the) primary source of material for ardent external critics of the social capital initiative within the Bank [for example, Fine, 2001 Fine B 2001 Social Capital Versus Social Theory: Political Economy and Social Science at the Turn of the Millennium London: Routledge [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] ; Harris, 2002 Harriss J 2002 De-Politicizing Development: The World Bank and Social Capital London: Anthem Press [Google Scholar] ]. Events were often co-sponsored by other units within the Bank, including the World Bank Institute (the Bank's education and training arm), and the Social Capital Initiative. Once again, as in the earlier work on social capital, this study was financed primarily by external agencies aiming to promote their concerns within the Bank: these were the UK Department for International Development, Swedish Sida, the MacArthur Foundation and indirectly the Swiss Development Corporation. Several departments within the World Bank also contributed. Michael Woolcock and Christian Grootaert, though their approaches to the concept were not identical; the latter was included in the WDR team more for his econometric skills and work on risk management. The lead author of the empowerment section was Monica Dasgupta. Stern is now Second Permanent Secretary and Managing Director, Budget and Public Finances, at the UK Treasury and Head of the UK's Government Economic Service. As Stern himself has done over several decades in rural India; see Lanjouw and Stern [ 1998 Lanjouw P Stern N 1998 Economic Development in Palanpur over Five Decades Oxford: Clarendon Press [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] ]. Ghani, pers. coms., 1999 Ghani A 1999 Personal communications various, Washington DC [Google Scholar] and 2000. As documented in a review conducted by the Poverty Group at the Bank in 1999–2000. See for instance discussions in Fox and Gershman [ 2000 Fox, J and Gershman, J. 2000. The World Bank and Social Capital: Lessons from Ten Rural Development Projects in the Philippines and Mexico. Policy Sciences, 33: 399–419. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ] for cases of such innovation, as well as cases of projects where staff are less inclined to change practice. Mehmet, Tahiroglu, and Li [ 2002 Mehmet, O, Tahiroglu, M and Li, E. 2002. Social Capital Formation in Large-scale Development Projects. Canadian Journal of Development Studies, 23(2): 335–57. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar] ] raise some similar issues, but in a much less critical manner. Similar observations would apply to other efforts at similar innovation, such as work with indigenous organisations and community forestry enterprises in Mexico, and programmes with farmers and peasant organisations in Senegal and Burkina Faso. This is Scott Guggenheim. By bridging social capital, Woolcock and Narayan [ 2000 Woolcock, M and Narayan, D. 2000. Social Capital: Implications for Development Theory, Research, and Policy. World Bank Research Observer, 15(2): 225–49. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ] refer to supra-communal linkages among social organisations; linking social capital refers to relationships with external state and non-state actors. The PRI is the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, the governing party in Mexico for most of the twentieth century. In the Mexican case the project began in a similar way, but then the task manager was changed, which also weakened the social component of the project [see also Fox and Gershman, 2000 Fox, J and Gershman, J. 2000. The World Bank and Social Capital: Lessons from Ten Rural Development Projects in the Philippines and Mexico. Policy Sciences, 33: 399–419. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ]. These are not trivial issues. See for instance press discussions of the departures of insiders criticising the Bank's ideas [ Ringle, 2002 Ringle K 2002 Bank Shot: Writing from the Inside, an Economist says the World Bank is Failing its Mission Washington Post 20 March, C01 [Google Scholar] ; Kahn, 2001 Kahn J 2001 World Bank Presses Inquiry on Economist who Dissents New York Times 7 Sept [Google Scholar] ]. In the case of this article three of us do or have worked in the Bank, making the argument autobiographical while also aiming to be analytical. This is a difficult combination, making the paper at best an exercise in participant observation, at worst one in self-legitimation based on a selective reading of institutional history and a certain defending of friendships. An encouraging example is recent World Bank work on social exclusion and poverty in Brazil [ World Bank, forthcoming World Bank (forthcoming) Brazil: Why do the Poor Stay Poor? A Study of Exclusion and Poverty Dynamics Washington DC: The World Bank [Google Scholar] ], which explicitly recognises 'class politics' and 'structural inequality', and encourages both land reform and asset redistribution as part of the policy response. The Bank's poverty assessment in Guatemala [ World Bank 2003 World Bank 2003 Guatemala Poverty Assessment Washington DC: The World Bank [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] ] raised similar issues.","This article explores the ways in which discussions of social capital have emerged within the World Bank, and how they interacted both with project practices and with larger debates in the institution. These debates are understood as a ‘battlefield of knowledge’, whose form and outcomes are structured but not determined by the political economy of the Bank. Understanding the debates this way has implications for research on the ways in which development discourses are produced and enacted, as well as for more specific discussions of the place of social capital in development studies. The article concludes with a reflection on implications of these debates for future research, policy, and practice.",A. Bebbington; S. Guggenheim; E. Olson; M. Woolcock,false,false,false,false,

Design/methodology/approach The VES production function is incorporated into an otherwise standard Diamond overlapping generations model. Findings Depending on parameter combinations, the economy can achieve a unique and stable steady state akin to that observed in the Solow-Swan model, reach a poverty trap or transition towards an upper bound of per capita capital stock. A special case of the VES production function is also consistent with unbounded growth. Research limitations/implications The paper is theoretical in nature. Further empirical analysis could shed deeper insights into the results presented in this study. Practical implications The VES production function, when applied to the context of the Diamond model, can capture a variety of growth experiences observed in the empirical literature. Social implications In the context of the Diamond model, a higher value of a particular parameter in the production function leads to greater intergenerational income and consumption inequality. Hence, the study provides a potential explanation for intergenerational inequalities observed in practice. Originality/value The study demonstrates the empirical value of the VES production function in explaining observed differences in factor shares, rewards and elasticities within and between countries over time.",Error fetching abstract,,theoretical,,theoretical,,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/131230/1/ves.pdf

rural youth. They provide a critical window of opportunity for addressing chronic nutritional deficits from
childhood, for “catch-up” growth, for providing a solid foundation for a healthy productive and
reproductive life, and for arresting the intergenerational transmission of malnutrition. In this study we
show that rural transformation processes are associated with improvements in rural youth nutrition –
malnutrition and underweight – in nearly all regions, although the pace of change varies considerably
across countries. Most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are faced with the double burden of
malnutrition and overweight/obesity, and in some countries this double burden is increasing, with the
prevalence of underweight and overweight/obesity rising concurrently.
The effect of rural transformation processes on rural youth nutrition is mediated by its effects on the
external and personal domains of the “food environment”. Transformation of agri-food systems are
bringing about large changes in the diets of rural youth in LMICs, and particularly of the younger age
groups, who appear to be witnessing rapid dietary transitions. The Young Lives dataset suggest that
certain near-universal changes in patterns of dietary and nutrient intake patterns can be discerned in
LMICs, although the pace of change varies. Dietary transitions are also driven by “globalisation
influences” – especially dissemination of information through digital/social media and food industry
advertising and marketing strategies – even in countries with low/slow rural transformation.
Our results show that rural transformation processes can have both positive and negative effects on
rural youth nutrition in LMICs. Despite the globalisation influences of international trade and agri-food
systems, dietary changes in individual LMICs are still influenced by national policies and production
patterns. Understanding the pathways to impact of rural transformation on rural youth nutrition is
crucial for designing “nutrition-sensitive” rural transformation policies.",,,false,,false,,

significant improvements in terms of lower fertility and mortality over the last forty years, which has brought down population growth rates to less than 1. 2% a year. These improvements have led, on average, to a demographic transition with lower dependency ratios. In general, this transition increases the ability of the society to take proper care of its non-working population groups, children and the elderly, which may be reflected in changes in household structure. We identify stylized facts about the implications of these changes at the micro level through the use of pseudo-panels from household-level data for Peru. We calculate age, cohort and year effects for variables related to household structure, educational attainment, labor force participation and savings. We find some evidence that suggests differences, by educational level, in the Peruvian demographic transition. Household size is smaller for the younger cohorts in all households but those with less educated heads. We argue that these different profiles are explained by the fact that reductions in fertility have not reached the less educated. On the one hand, these differences in household size patterns are similar to those in the number of children. On the other hand, cohort patterns in family living arrangements—i. e. , households with extended families—are similar across educational groups. However, family living arrangements change throughout the life cycle, in the sense that extended families are more common for households with very young (under 25) and elderly (over 60) heads. These changes in family arrangements over the life cycle add confusion to the meaning of headship, since in some cases the household reports as its head the older member and in other cases the main income earner. We also find that younger cohorts are more educated, are larger than older ones, and show lower returns to education. This is consistent with an increase in relative supply of educated workers that outpaces the increase in relative demand induced by economic growth, under the assumption of imperfect substitutability between equally educated workers of different cohorts. Finally, we show that intergenerational family arrangements over the life cycle limit the ability of the life cycle hypothesis (LCH) to explain household savings behavior. We find evidence that Peruvian households, especially the less educated, smooth consumption over the life cycle, not only through the typical saving-dissaving mechanism, but also by smoothing income.

an ecological framework, this 2-wave longitudinal study examined the effects of parentification on youth adjustment across the transition to adolescence in a high-risk, low-income sample of African American (58%) and European American (42%) mother–child dyads (T1 Mage = 10.17 years, T2 Mage = 14.89 years; 52.4% female). Children's provision of family caregiving was moderately stable from early to late adolescence. Emotional and instrumental parentification evidenced distinct long-term effects on adolescents' psychopathology and the quality of the parent–child relationship. Ethnicity moderated these relations. Emotional and instrumental parentification behaviors were associated with predominantly negative outcomes among European American youth in the form of increased externalizing behavior problems and decreased parent–child relationship quality, whereas emotional parentification was associated with positive outcomes among African American youth in the form of increased parent–child relationship quality, and instrumental parentification was neutral. These findings support a multidimensional view of parentification as a set of culturally embedded phenomena whose effects can only be understood in consideration of the context in which they occur. Utilizando un marco ecológico, este estudio longitudinal de dos tandas examinó los efectos de la parentificación en la adaptación de los jóvenes durante la transición a la adolescencia en una muestra de díadas madre-hijo (T1 edad promedio = 10,17 años, T2 edad promedio = 14,89 años; 52,4% femenino) afroamericanas (58%) y euroamericanas (42%) relativamente de alto riesgo y bajos recursos. El cuidado familiar brindado a los niños fue moderadamente estable desde la adolescencia temprana hasta la tardía. La parentificación emocional e instrumental demostró efectos marcados a largo plazo en la psicopatología de los adolescentes y en la calidad de la relación madre-hijo. El origen étnico moderó estas relaciones. Los comportamientos de parentificación emocional e instrumental estuvieron asociados con resultados predominantemente negativos entre los jóvenes euroamericanos en forma de mayores problemas de comportamiento externalizador y menor calidad de la relación madre-hijo, mientras que la parentificación emocional estuvo asociada con resultados positivos entre los jóvenes afroamericanos en forma de mejor calidad de la relación madre-hijo. La parentificación instrumental fue neutra. Estos resultados respaldan una perspectiva multidimensional de la parentificación como conjunto de fenómenos integrados culturalmente cuyos efectos solo pueden comprenderse teniendo en cuenta el contexto donde ocurren. 本项双波纵向研究采用生态化框架,调查了亲职化在青春过渡适应期对青少年的影响。研究样本选用了相对高风险低收入的非裔美国(58%)和欧裔美国(42%)人群中的母子二元关系(T1 Mage = 10.17 年, T2 Mage = 14.89 年,52.4% 女性).从青春期早期到青春期晚期(样本中)儿童对家庭提供的照料保持适度稳定。情感亲职化和实际功能方面的亲职化均呈现出对青少年精神病理学和亲子关系质量鲜明而长期的影响。种族因素对这些关系具有调节作用。情感和实际功能方面的亲职化行为在欧裔美国青少年中普遍体现为负面消极的影响,表现为外显化行为问题的增多和亲子关系质量的下降。而情感亲职化对非裔美国青少年有积极的影响,表现为亲子关系质量的提升。实际功能方面的亲职化对非裔美国青少年的影响为中性(非积极非消极)。这些发现支持我们用多维度的视角看待亲职化问题,将其视为一系列植根于特定文化中的现象,而其影响也只能在所发生的特定文化背景中被充分认识和理解。 Supportive and clear parent–child boundaries facilitate positive development, including the successful transition into young adulthood (Sroufe, Carlson, Levy, & Egeland, 1999). When familial boundaries are disrupted, children's attention and energy may be redirected from normative developmental tasks to adult spheres of responsibility and obligation. Many theorists discuss the potentially negative influence of ""parentification"" (Chase, 1999; Earley & Cushway, 2002), a family process in which children or adolescents assume adult responsibilities and/or parental roles that may be developmentally inappropriate (Boszormenyi-Nagy & Spark, 1973; Jurkovic, 1997). Yet relatively few studies have empirically investigated this phenomenon, and still fewer have done so within a multidimensional framework, which recognizes that there may be different forms of parentification, and acknowledges the potential for both positive and negative developmental effects (see Kerig, 2005, for discussion). Parentification encompasses a range of caregiving behaviors and is associated with an array of developmental outcomes. Across both emotional acts of caregiving, such as comforting and advising a parent, and instrumental caregiving behaviors, such as cooking and cleaning, parentification is associated with variable effects on children's adjustment, ranging from emotional–behavioral difficulties and reduced social competence on the one hand (Johnston, 1990) to improved competence and self-efficacy on the other (Kuperminc, Jurkovic, & Casey, 2009). These mixed findings have prompted calls for prospective research to evaluate factors that may moderate the impact of parentification on child development, including both features of the parentification itself and family characteristics (East, 2010). Responding to these calls, this investigation evaluated the influence of different forms of parentification on child adjustment across the transition to adolescence to (a) examine the stability of emotional and instrumental parentification from childhood to adolescence, (b) evaluate prospective and contemporaneous links between each form of parentification and both mother and youth reports of youth psychopathology (i.e., depressive symptoms, externalizing behavior problems) and parent–child relationship quality, and (c) investigate ethnicity as a moderator of these relations. Broadly defined, parentification is an outgrowth of a family process wherein children provide emotional and/or instrumental care for their parents (Jurkovic, 1997). In emotional parentification, the child is expected to fulfill a parent's need for support or companionship (e.g., by serving as a confidant or decision maker; Jurkovic, 1997), whereas instrumental parentification involves efforts to provide for the physical well-being of the household and its members by engaging in household tasks that are typically reserved for adults (e.g., grocery shopping and cleaning; Jurkovic, 1997). This study focused on emotional and instrumental forms of parentification as described above, yet definitional issues remain a fundamental concern in this field of research. Within the clinical literature alone, children who provide family caregiving have been referred to as parental children (Minuchin, 1974), burdened children (Chase, 1999), and spousified children (see Kerig, 2005, for review). In recent years, the terms filial responsibility (Jurkovic, Thirkield, & Morrell, 2001) and adultification (Burton, 2007) have come to the fore in the nonclinical literature, reflecting a desire to disentangle potentially normative levels of caregiving from the pathological connotations associated with parentification and related terms. Yet even the earliest theoretical work on parentification acknowledged that parentification could influence development in a beneficial manner by providing youth with opportunities to master socialization skills, and lessons in responsibility and self-reliance that contribute to healthy identity formation and self-esteem. Thus, early researchers suggested that ""parentification should not be unconditionally ascribed to the realm of 'pathology' or relational dysfunction. It is a component of the regressive core of even balanced, sufficiently reciprocal relationships"" (Boszormenyi-Nagy & Spark, 1973, p. 151). The boundary disruptions that are typically presumed to underlie parentification may, in some instances, more aptly reflect an adaptive flexibility of family roles that fosters positive well-being in some contexts, such as in single-parent families or families in which both parents work and the adult presence in the home is necessarily reduced. As such, parentification may be associated with different developmental outcomes, becoming problematic only when parents are chronically and/or excessively dependent upon their children for support and nurturance (Minuchin, 1974). In his study of families during the Great Depression, Elder (1974) noted a ""downward extension of adult responsibilities to children"" that often occurs when families encounter economic adversity. In these contexts, families bear the weight of economic hardship by simultaneously increasing their productivity (e.g., income) and decreasing their consumption of goods and services (e.g., child care). When adults spend more time outside the home, children may assume more adult responsibilities. As Burton (2007) noted, children in low-income families may not experience the pathological parentification discussed in the family therapy literature, and may instead derive benefits from their contributions to the family, particularly if they occur in response to ""temporary poverty,"" such as that caused by a short-term job lay-off. Following research suggesting that contextual factors may influence the form and function of parentification, we employed an ecological model of development to consider parentification as a proximal process, which is an enduring form of interaction in the immediate environment that is bidirectional and occurs on a fairly regular basis over an extended period of time. As defined by Bronfenbrenner and Morris (2006), proximal processes are the ""primary mechanisms producing human development"" (p. 795), but their form, power, content, and direction vary as a joint function of the person (e.g., gender, age), the environment (e.g., family structure, culture), and time. Consistent with this ecological perspective, research has shown that parentification often occurs in response to ecological stressors (e.g., poverty, illness), and its effects may be tempered by child characteristics and the cultural context in which they occur. Familial and structural factors influence the form and function of children's caregiving. Rates of parentification are higher in conditions of parental stress or dysfunction, including depression (Radke-Yarrow, Zahn-Waxler, Richardson, Susman, & Martinez, 1994), substance abuse (Kelley et al., 2007), and illness (Sang, Cederbaum, & Hurlburt, 2013; Stein, Riedel, & Rotheram-Borus, 1999). Children in single-parent families may take on the responsibilities of an absent spouse (Jurkovic et al., 2001), while those in low-income families may compensate for parents with multiple jobs who are unable to complete household tasks (Burton, 2007; McMahon & Luthar, 2007). Importantly, youth may benefit from culturally situated parentification, as evidenced by decreased depressive symptoms and increased self-efficacy (Juang & Cookston, 2009; Kuperminc et al., 2009). Parentification takes on increased salience and is associated with potentially distinct development effects in high-risk settings. Thus, this investigation employed a diverse, high-risk sample of low-income families with a large proportion of mothers suffering from psychiatric and/or substance use problems to evaluate the impact of parentification on youth adjustment and parent–child relationship quality across adolescence. In addition to evaluating the distinct effects of emotional and instrumental parentification on youth and family adjustment, this study capitalized on the diversity of the current sample to evaluate if and how ethnicity moderated these relations. Historically, emotional parentification has been viewed as more pernicious than instrumental parentification (see Chase, 1999; Jurkovic, 1997, for discussions), and research has largely supported this contention in studies of psychopathology (Jacobvitz, Hazen, Curran, & Hitchens, 2004), distress (Hooper, Marotta, & Lanthier, 2008), and social adjustment (Johnston, 1990). Instrumental parentification is not consistently linked with maladjustment (Stein et al., 1999), with some evidence suggesting it may be positively associated with children's social competence and self-esteem in some contexts (Kuperminc et al., 2009). However, this is not to say that the effect of emotional parentification is universally maladaptive, nor that instrumental parentification is always adaptive, as several factors may account for multifinality in children's adjustment. Growing evidence suggests that cultural, familial, and/or child characteristics may moderate the developmental effects of emotional and instrumental parentification. Compared to adolescents from European American families, those from African, Asian, and Latin American backgrounds report more acts of caregiving (Fuligni, Tseng, & Lam, 1999; Phinney, Ong, & Madden, 2000). Ethnic differences in rates of parentification may follow from cultural values embraced by each group, and the ecological challenges they face. Although European American families tend to value independence and autonomy, many ethnic minority groups in the United States have cultural traditions that downplay individual autonomy, and emphasize family interdependence, role flexibility, and responsibility (Harrison, Wilson, Pine, Chan, & Buriel, 1990). Cultural traditions, such as social role flexibility and extended kin support, may be an outgrowth of coping mechanisms that were born of historic necessity to combat various ecological challenges, such as discrimination and poverty (Harrison et al., 1990). In addition, cultural values may contribute to salient differences in family processes, even within ethnic groups. For example, higher levels of familism have been associated with positive parenting practices among Hispanic families (Santisteban, Coatsworth, Briones, Kurtines, & Szapocznik, 2012). Likely as a result of these contextual factors, youth's caregiving contributes to increased academic motivation, positive family relationships, and decreased depressive symptoms among Asian American and Latin American youth (Fuligni et al., 1999; Juang & Cookston, 2009). While much attention has focused on the rates and effects of parentification among European American, Asian American, and Latin American groups, African Americans have seldom been the focus of these investigations. This is surprising, given the findings of a few investigations that did include African Americans. For example, Jurkovic et al. (2001) found that African American youth reported more instrumental parentification than their European American peers, and ethnographic findings suggest that adultification is a relatively common phenomenon in African American families (Burton, 2007). While one might expect that African American and European American families would evidence similar rates and effects of parentification as both are influenced by American cultural norms, such a perspective fails to consider the cultural and sociodemographic currents that permeate and shape each group. By and large, African American families adopt strong cultural values of family reciprocity, role flexibility, and group survival, which provide a foundation for intergenerational family support (Harrison et al., 1990). Therefore, while parentification may constitute an aberrant process in European American families, it may be a culturally legitimate practice within African American families wherein these behaviors are supported and appreciated by the family and broader community (Anderson, 1999). Research demonstrates that related constructs, such as enmeshment (i.e., extreme parent–child interdependence; Kerig, 2005), are not associated with negative outcomes among African American youth, despite pronounced negative effects on European American youth (Watson & Protinsky, 1988; see also Jacobvitz et al., 2004). Given the unique value of close ties in African American families (McAdoo & Younge, 2009), what is experienced as stifling enmeshment among European American youth may engender strength and pride for African American youth. Surprisingly, despite strong theoretical support for the differential impact of parentification on youth adjustment in African American families relative to European American families, this investigation is among the first to evaluate these claims. Demographic trends in the United States, such as lower marriage rates and higher divorce rates (Fields, 2003), have reduced the presence of adults in the home, and ""consequently, shifted a large share of family care onto children and adolescents"" (East, 2010, p. 55). Thus, there is a need for research that evaluates how parentification influences development concurrently and over time. Extending a recent cross-sectional investigation of childhood caregiving (McMahon & Luthar, 2007), this study examined emotional and instrumental parentification across adolescence in a diverse and high-risk sample, and evaluated the moderating influence of ethnicity on observed patterns and effects of parentification. The first aim of this study was to describe patterns of emotional and instrumental parentification from early to late adolescence. Although we predicted that emotional parentification would increase from childhood through adolescence as children assume more adult-like, egalitarian relationships with parents (Carter & McGoldrick, 1980), levels of instrumental parentification across the transition to adolescence were explored given limited data in extant research concerning patterns over time. Similarly, in light of mixed findings in the literature, ethnic differences in rates of parentification were explored over time. The second aim of this investigation was to assess the impact of parentification on youth's adjustment as indicated by both maternal and youth reports of psychopathology (i.e., depressive symptoms and externalizing behavior problems) and parent–child relationship quality. These outcomes tap salient developmental issues pertinent to emotional, behavioral, and relational health that are widely recognized as important for adolescents' wellbeing (Obradović, van Dulmen, Yates, Carlson, & Egeland, 2006), and include both negative and positive indices of adjustment to account for the possibility that caregiving may serve as either a risk or promotive influence across contexts. Consistent with prior findings (e.g., Hooper et al., 2008), we expected that the developmental impact of emotional parentification would be distinct from that of instrumental parentification, with more pronounced negative outcomes in contexts of elevated emotional parentification, because it is often accompanied by guilt inducement, and is apt to be perceived as more stressful than instrumental parentification (Jurkovic, 1997). However, we recognize the potential for instrumental parentification to eventuate in negative developmental consequences, particularly if the demands imposed are beyond the child's capacity and skills. The third aim of this investigation was to assess the moderating role of ethnicity on relations between parentification and adjustment. African American children were expected to derive more benefits (and fewer costs) from their engagement in parentification than European American children due to differences in cultural values (e.g., interdependence, role flexibility). This study included 143 mother-child dyads drawn from a larger longitudinal study (N = 361) of maternal psychiatric disorders, substance use, poverty, and child development in a Northeast urban area (Luthar & Sexton, 2007). Dyads were excluded from the current study if (a) the child was older than 18 at T2 (n = 143), (b) the child did not return at T2 (n = 37), (c) the child did not reside with the same mother figure at T1 and T2 (n = 3), or (d) the mother belonged to an ethnic group (e.g., Hispanic, Multiracial) that comprised too few participants for interactive analyses (n = 35). The resulting subsample permitted the systematic evaluation of parentification patterns and consequences across the transition to adolescence, given that family roles change after 18 as youth leave home and take on more adult roles (Fuligni & Pedersen, 2002). The current sample was 58% African American and 42% European American. Slightly more children were female (52.4%) than male (47.8%), with a mean age of 10.17 years (SD = 1.59) at T1 and 14.89 years (SD = 1.60) at T2. On average, mothers had completed high school, nearly half (47.6%) were employed, and the majority (53.8%) were single parents. Time intervals between assessments were fairly consistent (range = 3–7 years; M = 4.72, SD = .73), and did not differ by any of the covariates, except for a negative relation with the number of siblings in the home (r = −.19, p = .03). Thus, we did not control for this variable in our analyses. The sample was recruited to overrepresent mothers with anxiety, affective, and/or substance use disorders. The Clinical Syndrome and Clinical Personality Pattern scales from the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (MCMI; Millon, Davis, & Millon, 1997) evaluated mothers' self-reported psychiatric distress and symptomatology at T1. Base rate scores >74 on the Dysthymia or Major Depression scales indicate the presence of clinical depressive symptoms (23.8%). Base rate scores >74 on the Anxiety or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder scales indicate clinical anxiety symptoms (44.1%). The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM–IV (DIS; Robins, Cottler, Bucholz, & Compton, 1995) was used to document the presence of a substance use disorder during the child's lifetime (44.8%) involving (a) alcohol, (b) opioids, (c) cocaine, (d) marijuana, (e) sedatives/hypnotics, (f) amphetamines, and/or (g) hallucinogens. A composite index of maternal psychopathology, including current anxiety and/or depression, which were assessed via self-report on the MCMI, and a history of substance abuse in the child's lifetime, which was assessed via self-report on the DIS, ranged from no disorders (35.7%), to one disorder (30.1%), two disorders (20.3%), or three disorders (14.0%). The sample was predominantly low-income. The most common sources of mother-reported financial support were food stamps (60.8%), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits (45.5%), rental subsidy (43.4%), and legal employment (39.2%). The median family income from all sources was $1,248.00 per month (M = $2,011.80, SD = $1,700.94). The current sample did not differ from excluded dyads on measures of parentification, ethnicity, child gender, maternal marital status, number of siblings, income, or maternal psychopathology. By design, children in the subsample were younger at T1 than children not examined here, t(359) = −12.79, p = .001. The current sample of mothers was marginally more educated, t(359) = 1.94, p = .053 and more likely to be employed, χ2(1) = 7.67, p = .006. Mothers were recruited through targeted announcements posted in social service offices, clinics, supermarkets, and other places frequented by women in low-income areas. Mothers were excluded if they had a history of psychosis or bipolar disorder, or were taking antipsychotic medications. Informed consent was obtained in writing from mothers and the child's legal guardian. Assent was obtained in writing from each child. Assessments were completed during a single session over two 60–90 minute segments. Interviewers had at least a bachelor's degree in psychology or social work and were trained and supervised in the administration of these measures by licensed clinical psychologists. Mother and child each received $40 compensation, and mothers received an additional $20 if their child completed the visit. All procedures were approved by the University's institutional review board. The Child Caretaking Scale (Baker & Tebes, 1994) was used to assess emotional and instrumental dimensions of parentification from the child's perspective. Children rated their degree of agreement with 30 statements describing different forms of caretaking along a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Subscales describing emotional parentification (e.g., ""I make my mother feel better when she gets upset"") and instrumental parentification (e.g., ""I help wash my family's clothes"") were identified by 8 and 10 items, respectively. Consistent with prior research using this measure (McMahon & Luthar, 2007), the scales evidenced moderate reliability (αT1 Emotional = .59, αT2 Emotional = .70; αT1 Instrumental = .66, αT2 Instrumental = .66). Child reports of depressive symptoms were obtained using the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1992). Child-reported depressive symptoms were preferred for these analyses given evidence that children are the most accurate informants about their own internalizing symptoms (Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987), and distressed mothers, who were overrepresented in this sample, tend to exaggerate their children's symptomatology (Renouf & Kovacs, 1994). The CDI is a 27-item self-report inventory that assesses depressed mood. Responses are scored on a scale from 0 (e.g., ""I am sad once in a while"") to 2 (e.g., ""I am sad all the time""), with total CDI scores ranging between 0 and 54. The CDI has good internal consistency and moderate test–retest reliability (e.g., Kovacs, 1992). Cronbach's α for the CDI total score was .81 and .87 at T1 and T2, respectively. CDI T scores are calculated based on a normative sample of 1266 youths by age (7–12 or 13–17) and gender. Total scaled T scores were used in these analyses, with scores ≥65 connoting clinically elevated depressive symptoms (9.1% and 9.8% of the current sample at T1 and T2, respectively). Maternal reports of child externalizing symptoms were obtained using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children and Adolescents (BASC; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992) because outside informants typically provide more accurate assessments of child externalizing (Achenbach et al., 1987). Mothers completed the BASC Parent Rating Scale using the Child (ages 8–11) or Adolescent (ages 12–18) version depending on the child's age. Responses are scored on a 4-point scale from 0 (never) to 3 (almost always). Child externalizing symptoms were summed across 34–35 items that tapped aggressive, disruptive, hyperactive, and antisocial behaviors (αchild form = .93; αadolescent form = .96 and .94 at T1 and T2, respectively). BASC T scores are calculated based on a nationally representative sample matched by age and gender. Total scaled T scores were used in these analyses, with scores of 60–69 indicating mild-moderate problems (9.8% and 7.7% of the current sample at T1 and T2, respectively), and scores ≥70 identifying serious problems (9.8% and 10.5% of the current sample at T1 and T2, respectively). Child reports of parent–child relationship quality were obtained using the Relations with Parents subscale from the BASC Self Report of Personality (BASC). Children completed either the Child (ages 8–11) or Adolescent (ages 12–18) version depending on the child's age. Responses are rated as true (1) or false (0). Parent–child relationship quality was measured by summing across 8–10 items that assessed the child's perceptions of the family and parent–child relational environment (e.g., ""I like to be close to my parents""; αchild form = .63; αadolescent form = .60 and .69 at T1 and T2, respectively). T scores ≤ 40 on the adaptive BASC scales indicate clinically significant impairment in functioning (5.6% and 11.2% of the current sample at T1 and T2, respectively; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992). Maternal reports of parent–child relationship quality were assessed with the Involvement scale of the Parent-Child Relationship Inventory (PCRI; Gerard, 1994). The PCRI assesses the parent's perceived relationship with the child. Items are rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). The Involvement scale consists of 14 items (e.g., ""I spend a great deal of time with my child""), with lower scores connoting less parental involvement. Cronbach's α for the Involvement scale was .76 and .79 at T1 and T2, respectively. PCRI T scores are calculated based on a nationally representative sample matched by age and gender (Gerard, 1994). Total scaled T scores were used in these analyses, with scores of 30–39 indicating mild-moderate problems (13.3% and 25.2% of the current sample at T1 and T2, respectively), and scores ≤ 29 identifying serious problems (0.7% and 5.6% of the current sample at T1 and T2, respectively). Analyses were conducted in Mplus version 6.1 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2010), using MLR estimation to yield maximum likelihood parameter estimates with standard errors that are robust to non-normality and nonindependence of observations. Missing data were estimated for child reports of caregiving at T2 (1.0%), child reports psychosocial functioning at T2 (1.4–5.6%), and maternal reports of child psychosocial functioning at T1 (1.4%) and T2 (6.3–9.1%). Diagnostic criteria (i.e., plots of residuals vs. predicted values, autocorrelation plots of residuals, normal probability plots of residuals) were evaluated to confirm that the data met regression analytic assumptions, including linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality (Afifi, Kotlerman, Ettner, & Cowan, 2007), and continuous predictors were centered to minimize collinearity. Post hoc simple slope analyses probed interactive findings following recommendations from Aiken and West (1991) and Dawson and Richter (2006). Effect size estimates were calculated using Cohen's d to further clarify the empirical and practical implications of the obtained results. Table 1 depicts means and standard deviations of study variables for the total sample and by ethnicity. Chi-square analyses indicated no significant differences in maternal employment by gender or ethnicity, but more African American than European American mothers were single parents (i.e., did not live with a romantic partner). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) evaluated differences in continuous covariates, parentification, and adjustment variables by gender, ethnicity, and their interaction. There were significant multivariate main effects for gender, Wilks' λ = .677, F (17, 98) = 2","Using an ecological framework, this 2-wave longitudinal study examined the effects of parentification on youth adjustment across the transition to adolescence in a high-risk, low-income sample of African American (58%) and European American (42%) mother-child dyads (T1 Mage = 10.17 years, T2 Mage = 14.89 years; 52.4% female). Children's provision of family caregiving was moderately stable from early to late adolescence. Emotional and instrumental parentification evidenced distinct long-term effects on adolescents' psychopathology and the quality of the parent-child relationship. Ethnicity moderated these relations. Emotional and instrumental parentification behaviors were associated with predominantly negative outcomes among European American youth in the form of increased externalizing behavior problems and decreased parent-child relationship quality, whereas emotional parentification was associated with positive outcomes among African American youth in the form of increased parent-child relationship quality, and instrumental parentification was neutral. These findings support a multidimensional view of parentification as a set of culturally embedded phenomena whose effects can only be understood in consideration of the context in which they occur.",Tamar Y.

Rockefeller created a new vision of American philanthropy. Foundations with large established endowments were to supply venture capital for the common good. And giving should be strategic—philanthropy should not simply respond to needs but should look for investment opportunities that yield significant returns.

During the first half of the 20th century this view of strategic philanthropy guided the formation of several private foundations. When establishing the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, Kate Macy Ladd wrote, “Experience seems to show that in an enlightened democracy private organized philanthropy serves the purposes of human welfare best by investigating, testing, and demonstrating the value of newer ideas.” Scientific research, coming of age in America at the same time as organized philanthropy, benefited greatly from foundations' support. From the 1890s to the 1940s private foundations were the major independent source of funding for all biomedical research. In 1940, foundations provided 27% of the $45 million spent on health-related research.

After World War II, federal agencies assumed the dominant role in funding scientific research. By the mid-1980s, total funding for research had ballooned to $14.8 billion. Foundations, the private academic sector, and voluntary health associations such as the American Heart Association contributed only 5% of that total. Private foundations, facing multiple demands on their limited resources, increasingly questioned the impact of their support for science compared with the funding provided by the federal government. The 1995 report “Foundation Giving,” published by the New York-based Foundation Center, estimated that while more than 50% of foundation grant dollars are targeted to education and health and human services, only 4% of grant dollars are targeted to science and technology. Only 2% of grant-making foundations support scientific research.

The transition from the 20th to the 21st century provides American philanthropy with an opportunity to review its history and to renew its commitment to science. Before 2040, the United States will experience the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in its history. Walter Russell Mead discussed this transfer of wealth in the premier issue of The American Benefactor. A conservative estimate of the amount of money due to be inherited by baby boomers from their frugal, postwar parents is $10 trillion. Although it is impossible to know what percentage of this wealth will be earmarked for charitable purposes, extrapolation from the rate at which new foundations are being created (approximately 1000 per year) and the rates of current philanthropic giving suggests that about 10% or $1 trillion could be set aside for philanthropic purposes. If the bulk of the $1 trillion endows private foundations, current IRS regulations would require that 5% of that amount, or $50 billion, be disbursed each year—a potential tripling in annual foundation giving. Such an occurrence provides an unprecedented opportunity to increase the amount of private funding available to support scientific research and technological development.

Advances in science speak directly to a number of issues concerning the United States and the world. As we worry about the needs of an aging population, neuroscience and genetics are unraveling the mysteries of Alzheimer's disease. As we struggle with how to provide quality education to increasingly diverse populations, scientists are learning much about how the human mind develops and learns. As we deal with increasingly global problems, researchers are developing sophisticated tools to model complex systems such as climate, population, and the emergence of disease that can be used to guide policy and inform decision-making. At the same time, fiscal constraints make it unlikely that the federal government can significantly increase its support of science. As with the coming of the 20th century, the coming of the 21st century presents private foundations with opportunities to support science and technology in the spirit of Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Kate Macy Ladd. However, unlike a century ago, private foundations can best accomplish this by joining in partnerships with other foundations, federal agencies, corporations, and individuals. In the new century, support for science must become a national, rather than federal, responsibility.","At the turn of the last century, wealthy citizens like Andrew Carnegie and John D.

Our methodology is grounded on the assumption that individuals’ social status is unobservable and must be estimated. In this framework, parents and offspring are clustered on the basis of the observed levels of income and occupational categories, thus avoiding any discretionary rule in the definition of class boundaries. The resulting transition matrix is a function of the posterior probabilities of parents and young adults of belonging to each class. Estimation is carried out via maximum likelihood by means of an expectation-maximization algorithm. We illustrate the proposed method using National Longitudinal Survey Data from the United States in the period 1978-2006.",,M.

These risks are clearly compounded by the food environment and subsequent exposure to ultra-processed foods.8Forbes JD Azad MB Vehling L et al.Association of exposure to formula in the hospital and subsequent infant feeding practices with gut microbiota and risk of overweight in the first year of life.JAMA Pediatr. 2018; 172e181161Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar This overconsumption of energy-dense foods, often a consequence of relentless direct and indirect marketing, is also accompanied by growing physical inactivity across childhood and adolescence. These gendered dimensions of overweight and obesity are often marked among girls and women in LMICs, especially among urban informal settlements with limited space and opportunity for physical activity. Much of the evidence in support of preventing overweight and obesity in the preconception period or during pregnancy stems from studies undertaken in high-income settings, and shows limited effects of lifestyle modification interventions on gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, and childhood overweight and obesity, especially among socially disadvantaged population subsets.11Salam RA Padhani ZA Das JK et al.Effects of lifestyle modification interventions to prevent and manage child and adolescent obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Nutrients. 2020; 122208Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar Similarly, although postnatal interventions aimed at reducing weight do show promising results,12Oh C Carducci B Vaivada T Bhutta ZA Interventions to promote physical activity and healthy digital media use in children and adolescents: a systematic review.Pediatrics. 2022; 149e2021053852IGoogle Scholar most follow-up durations have been relatively short and, as indicated, none of these studies are of direct relevance to populations in LMICs where the contexts differ considerably. The paucity of clinical trials and studies in LMICs should not detract from action given the strong evidence of epidemiological transition and health effects. Within services such as preconception care, antenatal services, and baby wellness clinics, every contact is important and could address the following problems: nutrition, physical activity, and sedentary behaviours in both parents; mental health support before, during, and after pregnancy; linkage to effective programmes for postpartum weight loss; and exclusive breastfeeding support and teaching parents about feeding cues, appropriate weight gain during infancy, and rethinking catch-up growth parameters for infants. Gender-specific strategies to improve lifestyle and reduce sedentary behaviour work, and work best when started early targeting school-age children and young adolescents.13Teng AM Jones AC Mizdrak A Signal L Genç M Wilson N Impact of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes on purchases and dietary intake: systematic review and meta-analysis.Obes Rev. 2019; 20: 1187-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar Further, examining interventions that target broader social determinants and living conditions and the food environment rather than narrow behaviour-modification strategies is crucial. To illustrate, the imposition of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed foods has shown some promising benefits on reducing consumption and sales,14Teng AM Jones AC Mizdrak A Signal L Genç M Wilson N Impact of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes on purchases and dietary intake: systematic review and meta-analysis.Obes Rev. 2019; 20: 1187-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar but needs to be evaluated across a range of contexts for impact and sustainability. Investing in and promotion of implementation research to better understand how best to scale up evidence-informed strategies, especially among disadvantaged and marginalised populations, is a priority. Irrespective of equity considerations and the burgeoning interest in deploying pharmacological and surgical interventions for obesity management in children and adolescents, we must ensure that appropriate emphasis and attention is paid to preventive public health strategies. Prevention is particularly important for LMICs where many treatment strategies for obesity used in richer countries are likely to be unaffordable. Given the US$35 billion spent on marketing by the milk-formula industry,15Rollins N Piwoz E Baker P et al.Marketing of commercial milk formula: a system to capture parents, communities, science, and policy.Lancet. 2023; 401: 486-502Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar approaches to prevention of obesity and non-communicable diseases must start early and effectively. These include clear targeting of appropriate care and education for schoolgirls and adolescents, and working with families and communities to promote a healthy lifestyle, physical activity, and reduction in the intake of ultra-processed commercial foods. Obesity prevention and management will mean working across sectors, including social protection and education, and require the development of strategies for regular monitoring and tracking of outcomes. WHO and major funding bodies have a key role in the promotion of high-quality and high-impact implementation research in obesity prevention and management. These strategies will cost money, but as the world has demonstrated during COVID-19, funds for research and development can be mobilised rapidly and can make a difference. Given the looming emergency of obesity and non-communicable diseases, this investment is a priority, not an expense. We declare no competing interests.

Instead, the political agenda was defined by COVID-19, which has served as an unwelcome, although timely, reminder of the fundamental interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic systems. True recovery and a transition to a more resilient global society can be achieved by adopting an approach based on planetary health with a core focus on reducing social inequalities. This focus is necessary because the most vulnerable people globally are also the least represented in powerful positions in government and industry. As with the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental degradation disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people in society—notably, populations from low-income settings and women worldwide. In the case of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), this impact is due to the combination of unfavourable geography, with regard to climate change impacts, and a relatively precarious socioeconomic situation. Consequently, people in LMICs are less able to prepare for and adapt to the effects of climate change than are those in high-income countries. For instance, food insecurity is a greater threat in these regions, where more people rely on small-scale agriculture, making them vulnerable to droughts, flooding, and extreme weather.1Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeClimate change and land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Geneva2019Google Scholar Climate change and pollution also affect the lives of women disproportionately, largely owing to socially entrenched differences in their roles and responsibilities. For example, women and children have the highest exposure to indoor air pollution from traditional cooking and heating, increasing their burden of disease. Women also have a higher mortality rate from climate-related disasters than do men.2Green Climate FundMainstreaming gender in green climate fund projects.https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/mainstreaming-gender-green-climate-fund-projectsDate: Aug 15, 2017Date accessed: December 8, 2020Google Scholar Despite bearing the brunt of these impacts, the voices of women, especially those from LMICs, are systematically under-represented at all levels of decision making. The COVID-19 pandemic is just one illustration of this; a mere 3·5% of COVID-19 expert taskforces showed gender parity in their membership.3van Daalen KR Bajnoczki C Chowdhury M et al.Symptoms of a broken system: the gender gaps in COVID-19 decision-making.BMJ Global Health. 2020; 5e003549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar This picture is similar to that in the world of climate policy.

Global Health 50/50, London2020Google Scholar The same study found that a mere ten leaders (5%) in global health were women from LMICs. We stress that dismantling outdated social barriers can reverse this bleak scenario. To build a healthy future for people and the planet, we need to redesign existing decision making structures to ensure the representation of the communities they serve. This step is about more than fairness and equity; it is an opportunity to tap into the intellectual and economic potential of more than half of the planet, for whom the doors to decision making and economic activity are so often barred. It has been estimated that advancing gender equality could add $12 trillion to the global economy.7Woetzel J Madgavkar A Ellingrud K et al.The power of parity: how advancing women's equality can add $12 trillion to global growth.https://www.mckinsey.com/∼/media/McKinsey/Industries/Public%20and%20Social%20Sector/Our%20Insights/How%20advancing%20womens%20equality%20can%20add%2012%20trillion%20to%20global%20growth/MGI%20Power%20of%20parity_Full%20report_September%202015.pdfDate accessed: December 8, 2020Google Scholar We represent the Women Leaders for Planetary Health, a social enterprise that addresses these needs by focusing on supporting women from LMICs. To equip young female professionals with new skills, knowledge, and networks, we have created a mentorship programme, with mentees from over 20 different countries. This programme is complemented by lectures on planetary health topics, soft skills trainings, and one-on-one guidance. This approach has been shown to be particularly valuable for women in helping to overcome the additional barriers to career advancement that they encounter.8O'Brien KE Biga A Kessler SR Allen TD A meta-analytic investigation of gender differences in mentoring.J Manag. 2008; 36: 537-554Google Scholar, 9Wanberg CR Welsh ET Hezlett SA Mentoring research: a review and dynamic process model.in: Martocchio JJ Ferris GR Research in personnel and human resources management. vol 22. Emerald Group Publishing, Bingley2003: 39-124Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar This enterprise is one step in the right direction, yet more needs to be done to change mindsets in societies and governance circles. Although we are working on overcoming the barriers that some women face in their professional lives, we are well aware of the structural and societal barriers that remain, as well as of our own advantages given that not all of us are from a LMIC. Thus, we recognise these asymmetrical power relations and encourage the planetary health community to empower women, especially those from LMICs, to be transformative agents in health, the environment, and human rights. Therefore, we call for further commitment from global health organisations to have equal representation of women from both high-income countries and LMICs. Supporting future change makers within planetary health will need more attention to the disruption of outdated systemic biases and prejudices that hinder women's leadership, especially in the most vulnerable countries. This untapped potential of women in LMICs can safeguard nature and improve human resilience, both of which are fundamental goals of the planetary health community.

Using optimizing finite lives overlapping generations combined with long-term real assets and adjustment costs in accumulating capital, this paper establishes new current account and welfare redistribution results caused by financial liberalization. After briefly describing the model for the closed economy case, we study the resulting evolution of the current account, the accumulation of capital, the real wage behavior and the adjustment of asset prices, when capital flows are allowed. Under the mentioned framework, we are able to show that an unanticipated liberalization of the capital account can cause an overshooting or an undershooting in external debt behavior during the transition. Another consequence associated with the liberalization policy, is the creation of some transitional welfare losers, eventhough the welfare of steady state generations is improved. By following appropriate compensatory policies, we can show that the country may achieve a Pareto welfare improvement for current alld future generations. As a wav of reducing the intergenerational redistributions induced bv the opening of the capital account, we discuss the alternative of adopting more gradual strategies of liberalization.",,,false,,theoretical,,

was recognised as the marker of adulthood in Australia, when young people had jobs—and even families of their own. Social and economic changes over the past 30 years or so have made the transition from school to work more complex and less clear-cut. This report documents the factors that shape the lives of 123 young participants in the Life Chances Study, as they turn 21. Key points • Stereotypes about young people obscure the diverse and complex lives of 21-year-olds. This diversity is shaped by family income, gender, ethnic background and resources. The 21-year-olds included university and TAFE students, full-time and part-time workers, young parents and jobseekers. Many were both studying and working. • Those with fewer resources were more likely to identify as adults. They faced challenges that those with more resources could avoid. While some welcomed adulthood, others felt the burden of responsibilities. • 21-year-olds continued to rely on their families for advice, and emotional and financial support. The unequal access to resources reinforced inequalities because even though most had jobs, many still relied on their parents’ financial support—if they could. • Disadvantage need not be intergenerational. Disadvantage or advantage persisted for some families, but not for all. Childhood in a low-income family did not necessarily condemn children to continuing disadvantage. • Definitions of a ‘successful’ transition must take into account young people’s multiple activities and their wellbeing. Most 21-year-olds aspired to full-time employment. In this study, most of those who did not have a job and were not studying or in training had caring duties or mental health issues. Labelling these young people as ‘disengaged’ does not sufficiently capture their level of activity or wellbeing. • Transitions for 21-year-olds are uncertain, but the social and economic resources needed to address this uncertainty are not evenly distributed. Those from high-income backgrounds with strong social supports had greater ‘choice’ while negotiating their pathways than those from lower income backgrounds. • Policies need to address multidimensional disadvantage. The findings have implications for addressing socioeconomic inequalities as well as for targeted career and vocational guidance. Background The Life Chances Study is a unique longitudinal study initiated by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in 1990 to explore the impacts of family income and associated factors on children over time. It commenced as a study of 167 infants born in inner Melbourne and has followed the families as they have moved elsewhere. In stage 10 of the study we surveyed 123 young people and their parents to see how they were dealing with the important transitions towards adulthood. We also undertook 25 interviews to explore their situations in more depth.",,,false,,empirical,,

urbanisation along with ageing populations, climate change, environmental degradation, COVID-19, and other pandemics present substantial challenges for people living in cities and other communities. The capacity to identify and respond to urban challenges related to health, equity, and sustainability varies greatly across national and subnational governments around the globe, because of the available human and financial resources, structures of governance and participation, and existing policy frameworks, which are all important determinants of healthy and sustainable urban environments. The status of the social and physical urban environments will also determine the magnitude of the challenge and the urgency of the response for each setting.1WHOWHO global strategy on health, environment, and climate change.https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331959/9789240000377-eng.pdf?ua=1Date: 2020Date accessed: April 13, 2022Google Scholar Identifying key challenges and opportunities for interventions is crucial to improving the health and wellbeing gains of urban dwellers and reducing exposure to stressors, shocks, and hazards, while also contributing to fostering wellbeing and reducing health inequalities.

City planning policies to support health and sustainability: an international comparison of policy indicators for 25 citiesCity planning policies influence urban lifestyles, health, and sustainability. We assessed policy frameworks for city planning for 25 cities across 19 lower-middle-income countries, upper-middle-income countries, and high-income countries to identify whether these policies supported the creation of healthy and sustainable cities. We systematically collected policy data for evidence-informed indicators related to integrated city planning, air pollution, destination accessibility, distribution of employment, demand management, design, density, distance to public transport, and transport infrastructure investment. Full-Text PDF Open AccessUsing open data and open-source software to develop spatial indicators of urban design and transport features for achieving healthy and sustainable citiesBenchmarking and monitoring of urban design and transport features is crucial to achieving local and international health and sustainability goals. However, most urban indicator frameworks use coarse spatial scales that either only allow between-city comparisons, or require expensive, technical, local spatial analyses for within-city comparisons. This study developed a reusable, open-source urban indicator computational framework using open data to enable consistent local and global comparative analyses. Full-Text PDF Open AccessWhat next? Expanding our view of city planning and global health, and implementing and monitoring evidence-informed policyThis Series on urban design, transport, and health aimed to facilitate development of a global system of health-related policy and spatial indicators to assess achievements and deficiencies in urban and transport policies and features. This final paper in the Series summarises key findings, considers what to do next, and outlines urgent key actions. Our study of 25 cities in 19 countries found that, despite many well intentioned policies, few cities had measurable standards and policy targets to achieve healthy and sustainable cities. Full-Text PDF Open AccessDetermining thresholds for spatial urban design and transport features that support walking to create healthy and sustainable cities: findings from the IPEN Adult studyAn essential characteristic of a healthy and sustainable city is a physically active population. Effective policies for healthy and sustainable cities require evidence-informed quantitative targets. We aimed to identify the minimum thresholds for urban design and transport features associated with two physical activity criteria: at least 80% probability of engaging in any walking for transport and WHO's target of at least 15% relative reduction in insufficient physical activity through walking. The International Physical Activity and the Environment Network Adult (known as IPEN) study (N=11 615; 14 cities across ten countries) provided data on local urban design and transport features linked to walking.

As such it can also be construed as part of an agenda associated with advocates of a functionings and capabilities approach to societal well-being, and human development human development (Nussbaum Citation2011; Sen Citation2009).3. Indeed in terms of the nature versus nurture debate, it is doubtful that resemblances due to nature can be totally eliminated or compensated for.4. Equal opportunity programmes observed amongst Western societies do seem to be of this flavour. For example, when questioned on the widening gap between the rich and poor, the British Prime Minister responded that: … the issue is not in fact whether the very richest person ends up being richer. The issue is the poorest person is given the chance they don't otherwise have. The most important thing is to level up, not level down.Interview with the Prime Minister on BBC News Newsnight on 4 June 2001. Transcript available from http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/newsnight/1372220.stm.5. Much time is spent in introductory statistics courses stressing that, while independence implies zero covariance, zero covariance (the basis of inference on ) does not imply independence! Think about an exact non-independent relationship for (a fairly plausible technology), with parent quality uniformly distributed in . A random sample of agents from this would yield zero covariance between and , and hence a zero estimate of implying independence for what is a completely dependent relationship.6. While parent–child education relationships are clearly monotonic it is not clear that other relationships, e.g. parental income–child education are not necessarily monotonic given notions of diminishing marginal returns to scale in investment in education.7. The Overlap Measure proposed in this paper can be adapted to the three conceptions of intergenerational mobility suggested by Van de Gaer, Schokkaert, and Martinez (Citation2001), since each transition matrix implies a particular structure for the joint density matrix, which the empirical joint density can be measured against. Further, the third mobility measure for Markov chains proposed by Van de Gaer, Schokkaert, and Martinez (Citation2001) is related to the Overlap Measure in the sense that it measures the complement to the overlapping region of the conditional probabilities.8. Appendix 1 provides a brief description of how the measure is estimated. These indices are confined to the unit interval with proximity to one representing the ultimate in social justice however defined.9. Anderson (Citation1999), Cavanagh (Citation2002), Hurley (Citation1993), Piketty (Citation2000), and Swift (Citation2005) are some opponents.10. Studies into the effect of divorce law changes include the following: (a) divorce rates (Allen Citation1992; Friedberg Citation1998; Peters Citation1986, Citation1992; Wolfers Citation2006), (b) marriage rates (Rasul Citation2006), (c) child outcomes (Gruber Citation2004; Johnson and Mazingo Citation2000), (d) marriage-specific investments (Stevenson Citation2007), and (e) domestic violence rates (Stevenson and Wolfers Citation2006).11. Studies of the effect of custodial law changes include (a) implications for a non-custodial parent's willingness to make child custody payment (Del Boca and Ribero Citation1998; Weiss and Willis Citation1985), and (b) implications for divorce and marriage rates, and consequent impact on child investments (Brinig and Buckley Citation1998; Halla Citation2013; Halla and Holzl Citation2007; Leo Citation2008; Nunley and Seals Citation2009; Rasul Citation2006).12. Anderson, Leo, and Muelhaupt (Citation2014) showed that in a constrained world with no growth in average child outcomes, movement towards an equal opportunity outcome for one group of children must necessarily make another group of children worse off.13. Interestingly, some school boards met the equality mandate by penalizing white schools. King George County, Virginia, for example, chose to equalize its curriculum by dropping several advanced courses from its White high school rather than add them at the Black school, an example of a symmetric equal opportunity policy which we argue is not generally observed in the 1960–2000 period.14. The respective coded parental marital status responses are as follows: married, spouse present is 1; married, spouse absent is 2; separated is 3; divorced is 4; widowed is 5; never married/single is 6. This paper does not examine children born outside of wedlock, nor marriages where one parent is ""missing"" (responses 2 and 6).15. Nonetheless, the results for children of age 16 and 17 are similar and are available from the authors upon request. However, this is quite different from more traditional approaches to generational relationships where the outcomes of offspring are related to parental outcomes at similar points in the life cycle. If rates and periods of development differ by gender or race, some of the offspring differences observed here could be quite different if observed at a later stage of the life cycle.16. When considering pure EO measures, and mobility by family structure, a first concern is whether differing familial household structures have different transition structures. By comparing the overlap of the joint densities of intact versus single, and widowed versus divorced/separated parent families, the possibility of common transit structures was examined. Here, an overlap of 1 implies a common transit structure, and a value of less than 1 implies otherwise. The hypothesis of common transitional structures was rejected in every case; the results are available from the authors on request.17. These results are similar to those for Canada (Anderson, Leo, and Muelhaupt Citation2014).18. This test corresponds to those presented by Lefranc et al. (Citation2008, Citation2009), though in this case the respective circumstance classes are race and gender.","Abstract The notion of equality of opportunity (EO) has pervaded much of economic and social justice policy, and research over the last half century.

Yet, there is a significant gap in the literature about the trends, causes and consequences of late child bearing in Asian societies. Underpinning the ultra-low fertility rates in high-income East Asian societies including Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Japan is the significant delay in transitioning to parenthood. The median age at first birth in these societies is now the oldest among all high-income societies globally, and more than 20 per cent of all first births occurred to women aged 35 and above. Taking a life course perspective to investigate the shifting age norm for parenthood and the causes of late parenthood would provide a more insightful understanding of the phenomenon. In addition, the consequences of late parenthood observed in Western countries are also likely to manifest in these societies, with intergenerational consequences deserving special attention within the Asian context.",,Mengni Chen,false,,false,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17441730.2024.2348931?needAccess=true

We do so by adopting a macro-level perspective and a multi-axis conceptualization of children's outcomes - health at birth, health in later life, and schooling - and leveraging Demographic and Health Survey and World Bank data across 75 LMICs. Our results show that in societies where partnerships are characterized by more equal status between spouses - i.e., where the age range between spouses and differences in years of schooling between partners are narrower - children fare better on several outcomes. These associations are particularly strong in mid- and high-fertility settings. Despite a series of regularities, our results also highlight a set of findings whereby, at a macro-level, the prevalence of marriage and divorce/separation are not invariably associated with children's outcomes, especially in LMICs where fertility is comparatively lower. We document little cross-regional heterogeneity, primarily highlighting the centrality of demographic factors such as age vis-à-vis, for instance, region-specific characteristics that are more tied to the social fabric of specific societies.",Ewa Batyra; L.

[406]}",en,False,closed,"Driven by the social and political transformations and the general economic situation, the overall employment situation in Romania become very complex. It has shifted from generalized standard employment in socialism to wider informal or non-standardized forms of work. Over the last 25 years, Romania has undergone a very long and difficult transition period, with several social and economic recessions. The recent economic crises contributed to a decline in the country’s social and economic situation, especially for vulnerable groups (youth, aged employees, disabled or ethnic minorities) that are less protected in the face of economic challenges. Employment is one of the most important factors responsible for standard of living and quality of life. The labour market was particularly affected by crises, and the main consequences were unemployment, but also the emergence of atypical employment forms and substitute strategies for economic survival. The analysis of monetary indicators (poverty rate, equalized median income) and the non-monetary measure of poverty (deprivation rate) demonstrates a poor condition in Romania, in comparison with the European average. The article’s research objective is to study the occupational situation of a vulnerable population in a rural Romanian community. The population living in a situation of precarious prosperity (coined by Hubinger in 1996) is defined by irregular income, income and material deprivation, the concept being operationalized by following the methodology of multidimensional poverty measurement. The data were gathered through face-to-face interviews that included a wide variety of topics: employment and career paths, intergenerational exchanges, coping strategies and standards of living. To analyse the data we used analytic induction to identify the main patterns of precarious work in the area under study, investigating the dimensions of instability, insecurity, working conditions, accident risks and level of income. The results showed the dominant pattern of employment in the community to be informal, daily based work in construction, services or subsistence agriculture. Access to more stable jobs is obstructed by the costs of commuting to the neighbouring cities, as well as by the lack of social services for children or other dependent family members. The social consequences of precarious work in this community are observed in individual and family life, and particularly affect the younger generation, for whom the absence of permanent jobs delays the transition to adulthood and independence. The article’s results confirmed that there is a population living in a situation of precarious prosperity, based on informal employment experiences, very poor working conditions, low payment and adverse social consequences.",,,false,,false,,

We first introduce mobility indices and tests which examine the proximity of the transition matrix to that which would pertain in the perfectly mobile state. Unlike existing transition matrix based mobility indices, these indices and tests can be employed when the transition matrix is not square, and when the transition matrix is between states that are defined multivariately or more generally when the quantiles of the marginal states are unmatched. Using educational attainment as a proxy for permanent income for children and both educational attainment and income as proxies for parents, the tests indicate that mobility significantly increased, both in the population as a whole and within intact parent and single parent sub-populations, over the period. Within the single parent group there was much less evidence for significant mobility change for children from exogenous single parent families than for children from endogenously single parent families, which accords with theoretical predictions. There is also some evidence of convergence between intact and single parent groups, suggesting that there is a trend towards equal opportunity for children of intact and endogenously single parent families.",,,empirical,,empirical,,

[1043]}",en,False,closed,"Youth population is increasing explosively particularly in developing countries as a result of rapid urbanization. This increase is bringing large number of social and economic problems. For instance the impacts of job and
training availability, and the physical, social and cultural quality of urban environment on young people are enormous, and affect their health, lifestyles,
and well-being (Gleeson and Sipe 2006). Besides this, globalization and technological developments are affecting youth in urban areas in all parts of the world, both positively and negatively (Robertson 1995).

The rapidly advancing information and communications technologies (ICTs) helps in addressing social and economic problems caused by the rapid growth of urban youth populations in developing countries. ICTs offer opportunities to young people for learning, skill development and employment. But there are downsides: young people in many developing countries lack of having
broad access to these new technologies, they are vulnerable to global market changes, and ICTs link them into global cultures which promote consumer goods, potentially eroding local cultures and community values (Manacorda
and Petrongolo 1999). However we believe that the positives outweigh such negatives.

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the world’s young population number more than they ever have. There are over a billion young people between the ages of 15 and 24, which 85 per cent of them live in developing countries and mainly in urban environments. Many of these young people are
in the process of making, or have already made, the transition from school to work. During the last two decades all around the world, these young people, as new workers, have faced a number of challenges associated with
globalization and technological advances on labour markets (United Nations 2004). The continuous decrease in the manufacturing employment is made many of the young people facing three options: getting jobs in the informal
economy with insecurity and poor wages and working conditions, or getting jobs in the low-tier service industries, or developing their vocational skills to
benefit from new opportunities in the professional and advanced technical/knowledge sectors. Moreover in developing countries a large portion of young people are not even lucky enough to choose among any of these options, and consequently facing long-term unemployment, which
makes them highly vulnerable.

The United Nations’ World Youth Employment report (2004) indicates that in almost all countries, females tend to be far more vulnerable than males in terms of long-term unemployment, and young people who have advanced qualifications are far less likely to experience long-term unemployment than others. In the limited opportunities of the formal labour market, those with limited vocational skills resort to forced entrepreneurship and selfemployment
in the informal economy, often working for low pay under
hazardous conditions, with only few prospects for the future (United Nations 2005a).

The International Labour Organization’s research (2004) revealed that the labour force participation rates for young people decreased by almost four per cent (which is equivalent of 88 million young people) between 1993 and
2003. This is largely as a result of the increased number of young people attending school, high overall unemployment rates, and the fact that some young people gave up any hope of finding work and dropped out of the labour market. At the regional level, youth unemployment was highest in
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (25.6%) and sub-Saharan Africa (21%) and lowest in East Asia (7%) and the industrialized economies(13.4%) (International Labour Organization 2004). The youth in economically disadvantaged regions (e.g. the MENA region) face many challenges in education and training that delivers them the right set of skills and knowledge demanded by the labour market. As a consequence, the transition from school to work is mostly unsuccessful and young population end up either unemployed or underemployed in the informal sectors (United Nations 2005b).

Unemployment and lack of economic prospects of the urban youth are pushing many of them into criminal acts, excessive alcohol use, substance addiction, and also in many cases resulting in processes of social or political
violence (Fernandez-Maldonado 2004; United Nations 2005a). Long-term unemployment leads young people in a process of marginalisation and social exclusion (United Nations 2004). The sustained high rates of long-term youth unemployment have a number of negative effects on societies. First, it results in countries failing to take advantage of the human resources to increase their productive potential, at a time of transition to a globalized world that inexorably demands such leaps in productive capacity. Second, it reinforces
the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Third, owing to the discrepancy between more education and exposure to the mass media and fewer employment opportunities, it may encourage the spread of disruptive behaviours, recourse to illegal alternatives for generating income and the loss
of basic societal values, all of which erode public safety and social capital.

Fourth, it may trigger violent and intractable political conflicts. And lastly, it may exacerbate intergenerational conflicts when young people perceive a lack of opportunity and meritocracy in a system that favours adults who have
less formal education and training but more wealth, power and job stability (Hopenhayn 2002). To assist in addressing youth’s skill training and employment problems this
paper scrutinises useful international practices, policies, initiatives and programs targeting youth skill training, particularly in ICTs. The MENA national governments and local authorities could consider implementing similar initiative and strategies to address some of the youth employment issues. The broader aim of this paper is to investigate the successful practice and strategies for the information and communication related income generation opportunities for young people to: promote youth
entrepreneurship; promote public-private partnerships; target vulnerable groups of young people; narrow digital divide; and put young people in charge.

The rest of this paper is organised in five parts. First, the paper provides an overview of the literature on the knowledge economy, skill, education and training issues. Secondly, it reviews the role of ICTs for vocational skill
development and employability. Thirdly, it discusses the issues surrounding the development of the digital divide. Fourthly, the paper underlines types and the importance of developing ICT initiatives targeting young people, and
reviews some of the successful policy implementations on ICT-based initiatives from both developed and developing countries that offer opportunities to young people for learning, skill development and employment. Then the paper concludes by providing useful generalised recommendations for the MENA region countries and cities in: advocating
possible opportunities for ICT generated employment for young people; and discussing how ICT policies could be modified and adopted to meet young people’s needs.",,,false,,false,,

the University of Houston, provides a thoughtful overview of the determinants of food consumption and their implications on health and economic outcomes. Bhargava highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach to understand the pathways linking the effects of biomedical, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic factors with nutrition and health outcomes. The book is a provocative attempt to build a bridge between scientists from diverse disciplines (nutrition, anthropology, psychology, economics and public health) and decision-makers.

The author reviews a variety of thematic areas, including the effect of nutrition and socioeconomic factors on childhood morbidity and cognitive development, the association between nutrition and labour productivity among adults and an overview of the determinants of obesity. Overall, the book highlights the positive effects of enhanced diet quality (high in micronutrients and protein) on health and economic outcomes such as labour productivity. Likewise, it shows that adequate nutrition early in life, maternal nutrition and various socioeconomic factors predict child development. The text emphasizes the complex association between food intake and socioeconomic conditions, individual preferences, cultural habits and food availability. Studies on the effect of changes in food prices or income on food consumption provide important evidence for policy-makers. For example, policies to deliver nutritious foods are most needed in countries or regions with low-income elasticities for micronutrients and proteins. Similarly, subsidies to promote the consumption of “healthy food” in obesigenic environments may be successful if studies reveal increased consumption of fruits and vegetables when prices are reduced.

A review of studies from various developing countries illustrates how evidence can be used to delineate food policies in settings with constrained resources. Using intuitive examples and adding methodological notes for a more technical reader, the author highlights how econometric techniques allow unbiased estimation of intervention effects and invites economists to challenge common assumptions and to expand their vision by engaging with other disciplines.

Bhargava does not fully develop two issues that deserve deeper discussion. First, although average estimates may reveal the potential impact of interventions, they may not suffice to inform how programmes can be efficiently delivered when their effects are heterogeneous across specific populations.

While it is undeniable that observational studies, and particularly those with longitudinal designs, can provide rich evidence to outline public policies, translating this evidence into effective interventions remains a great challenge. Well designed impact evaluations of interventions could disentangle factors associated with heterogeneous effects in the population. Factors associated with unexpectedly lower effects of interventions, such as violent domestic environments, low adherence among specific groups of the target population and varied quality of health services should be carefully studied.

Second, although the book separately discusses the burden of undernutrition in poor countries and increasing obesity in affluent nations, little is mentioned about the challenges imposed by the coexistence of both conditions within a country, region or even the same household. Such dual burdens are affecting countries entering the nutritional transition where economic development and access to services are unevenly distributed.1–3

Policies that concurrently tackle under- and over-nutrition are cumbersome. Both underweight and overweight individuals have low quality diets. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that overweight women and children are likely to have iron deficiency and impaired iron absorption.4 Enhancing calorie consumption while promoting balanced diets and healthy lifestyles is critical to reduce the dual burden.

While potentially easier to define and implement, fragmented approaches to reducing malnutrition may result in unwanted effects.1 Incentives such as subsidies may promote consumption of fruits and vegetables among overweight individuals. However, it may not be an optimal policy for underweight children who need higher protein intake or specific combinations of micronutrients. Similarly, distribution of fortified food to reduce micronutrient deficiencies in emaciated children can adversely affect overweight children by augmenting their caloric intake.

Likewise, conditional cash transfers, which are aimed at reducing intergenerational poverty via demand-side incentives, have contributed to improvements in undernutrition and anthropometric outcomes, but may stimulate behaviours that lead to overweight and obesity.5 Risk of adverse outcomes such as an increase in obesity is likely to be high in areas of limited dietary knowledge or where unhealthy meals are more widely available and more affordable than nutritious food.6

The coexistence of under- and overweight individuals within the same household is an even more complex phenomenon than population-level dual burdens of malnutrition. Little is known about how food is distributed within these families, how food expenditures and feeding practices are decided, or how parents’ habits, preferences and beliefs determine children’s eating behaviours. A better understanding of the determinants of the dual burden within a household is needed to formulate adequate policies.

Food, economics and health presents an interesting approach to nutrition and food policies. The book opens multiple challenges and unsolved questions that require further research. As an economist, I appreciate the effort to convey the benefits of rigorous statistical analysis to readers from different backgrounds and advocate multidisciplinary approaches to analysis and policy designs. ■","In his book Food, economics and health, Alok Bhargava, a professor of economics at the University of Houston, provides a thoughtful overview of the determinants of food consumption and their implications on health and economic outcomes.

local economy: the local economic structure and income distribution widens the gap between rich and poor households. A constructive policy towards sustainable development would place greater emphasis on productive restructuring the agricultural sector, road transport and electric power generation, in designing actions of technological change and sustainable natural resource management. An exhaustive hybrid environmental social accounting matrix (ESAM) and linear multipliers models are used to analyse the interactions of the local economy with the use of resources, the environment and income distribution. Esta investigación se centra en el estado de Yucatán (México) y proporciona evidencia del desempeño no sostenible de la economía local: la estructura económica local y la distribución de ingresos amplían la brecha entre los hogares ricos y pobres. Una política constructiva que busque el desarrollo sostenible haría mayor hincapié en la reestructuración productiva del sector agrícola, el transporte por carretera y la generación de energía eléctrica, a la hora de diseñar cambios tecnológicos e iniciativas de gestión sostenible de los recursos naturales. Para analizar las interacciones de la economía local con el uso de los recursos, el medio ambiente y la distribución de ingresos se utiliza una matriz exhaustiva híbrida de contabilidad social y ambiental (ESAM, por su siglas en inglés) y modelos de multiplicadores lineales. 本稿では、メキシコのユカタン州に注目し、持続不可能な地域経済の実績のエビデンス、すなわち、裕福な世帯と貧しい世帯の格差を拡大させる地域の経済構造と所得分配を提示する。技術変革と自然資源の持続可能な利用管理の実行計画において、持続可能な発展に向けた建設的政策は、農業セクター、道路交通、発電の生産的再構築に重点が置かれるであろう。環境社会会計行列 (environmental social accounting matrix: ESAM)と線形乗数モデルの、網羅的なハイブリッドを用いて、地域経済と資源の利用、環境、所得分配との相互作用を分析する。 The objectives of sustainable development (OSD) include a set of actions that are implemented in an articulated way leading to the overcoming of poverty, reduction of inequality, creation of quality employment opportunities and conservation of natural resources, among other purposes (UNDP, 2016). The challenge for governments of subnational countries and regions is to determine how to implement this set of actions to generate continuous development processes in a complex and dynamic context in the geographical space of a particular territory. In the interaction economy-society-environment, there can be virtuous circles that lead to economic prosperity, reduction of social gaps and conservation of the environment. But it is also possible that there are vicious circles in which economic growth has negative effects such as widening economic gaps between households or some environmental degradation. In determining the sustainable development strategy to be implemented in a particular territory, it is important to know the direction of the interactions of the economic, social and environmental spheres that are presented in a given geographic space in a dynamic context. That is, the feedbacks are presented in the three dimensions, but bounded to a territory in a continuum of points in time. The set of sustainable development goals implemented in a co-ordinated manner by regional governments can lead to a multiplicity of development processes depending on the economic, social and political structures that make up a particular territory. In a given geographic space the goals may be discordant to each other or conflict with one another and lead to unsustainable development paths. In other territories they can reinforce each other and generate processes of harmonious development. This research focuses on the state of Yucatan, Mexico, and analyses the sustainability of local development at a point in time (2003) in three dimensions: economic, social and environmental. Sustainability is understood as a process in which the pattern of organization of production, the structure of consumption and accumulation of wealth in the local economy is in harmony with the local and global ecosystem in the satisfaction of the material needs of the population in a continuum of points in time (United Nations, 2003; WCED, 1987). The conceptual framework of sustainability is the basis for the development of the present work in line with the theoretical and methodological approaches of the school of ecological economics and to a lesser extent of environmental economics (Aguilera & Alcántara, 1994; Martínez & Roca, 2006; Pearce & Turner, 1990). In this sense, it is interesting to elucidate the directions of the interactions of the social, economic and environmental spheres in the geographical territory of Yucatan in Mexico, a territory with wide cultural, environmental and social richness. Also to determine if such interactions trigger sustainable development processes in the region. The state of Yucatan in Mexico possesses vast natural resources with abundant forest, water, coastal and aquatic resources, numerous cultural and tourist destinations and a growing economy that offers a high quality of life for the population (Lutz, Prieto, & Sanderson, 2000; OECD, 2007; SEMARNAT-CONAFOR, 2014). However, sustainable development in the region faces obstacles that if not removed can lead to the widening of economic gaps between households and processes of environmental degradation. In this context, the general objective of this paper aims to determine if the economic structure of the region is compatible with social development and conservation of natural resources in the geographical territory of Yucatan, Mexico in a specific point in time. Multisectorial models based on input–output (I-O) tables or social accounting matrices (SAMs) are frequently used in regional analysis, covering all kinds of issues: for example, Brandsma, d'Kancs, Monfort, and Rillaers (2015) present the uses of I-O tables in combination with computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to analyse the impact of regional cohesion policies within the European Union; Fuentes-Saguar, Vega-Cervera, and Cardenete (2017) use linear models based on SAMs to analyse the socioeconomic impact in Extremadura (Spain) of the closure of a nuclear power plant and Duarte, Mainar-Causapé, and Sánchez-Chóliz (2017) use SAMs to analyse the regional differences in Spain in reference to and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Regarding environmental regional analysis, Flores and Mainar (2010), Llop and Pié (2011) and Franco Solís and De Miguel Vélez (2017) are good example of the application of this tools. Input-ouptut, SAMs and linear models have also been used to study the productive structure of Mexico, both at the national level (Beltrán, Cardenete, Delgado, & Núñez, 2016; Núñez, 2018) and regionally: Núñez and Cruz (2009) analyse the economy of Oaxaca through IO analysis. and Chiquiar, Alvarado, Quiroga, and Torre Cepeda (2017) carry out a detailed study of the manufactures exports through regional I-O tables. Specific studies on energy sustainability have also been carried out using I-O (Guevara, Córdoba, García, & Bouchain, 2017). In recent years, multisectorial models have been widely used to address the issues of climate change, energy issues and water use. The models derived from the input–output framework focus on the analysis of the productive structures of the economies. The models based on SAMs emphasize the processes of distribution and redistribution of the income generated in the economies; and its extension to the Environmental Social Accounting Matrices (ESAM) allows analysing the implications of productive structures, consumption and accumulation in natural resources and the environment. To achieve the general objective of the investigation, an ESAM with economic and social accounts in monetary units and environmental accounts in physical units is estimated. The hybrid ESAM serves as the basis for the estimation of a model of accounting multipliers of the economy of Yucatan, Mexico for the year 2003. The accounting multipliers are decomposed in such a way that the articulations of the local economy with the use of resources (groundwater use and energy consumption), the environment (emissions to the atmosphere) and income distribution at the household level can be discerned. In the construction of the hybrid matrix we adopt the methodologies most used in the literature, but adapted to the reality of the regional economy. The estimated hybrid matrix is ​​proposed as a statistical approach to the reality of a local economy and as a first step towards the compilation of an integrated system of regional accounts that brings together the socioeconomic and environmental dimension into a single analysis instrument and avoids the dispersion of data and information. The literature that addresses environmental pressure and, on the other hand, the generation of income and its distribution, both within a single analytical framework, is of recent development. In the 1990s, the document entitled ""System of environmental economic accounts [SEEA]"" (United Nations, 1993) offers a methodological proposal for integrating the SNA (system of national accounts) into a new matrix format with social and environmental indicators in physical units giving rise to the ESAMs. The accounting system has been extended and refined in the SEEA 2012. However, the applied developments of the ESAM have been rather scarce. The first work in this line of analysis belongs to Resosudarmo and Thorbecke (1996) who assess the impact on household income of environmental policy in Indonesia, as well as Thorbecke and Jung (1996) who evaluate social policies also in Indonesia. Recent applications of the ESAM approach emerged in the 2000s to address social concerns (Alarcón, Van Heemst, & Jong, 2000; Pieters, 2010) and environmental concerns on three major issues: water, energy and air emissions (Duarte, Mainar, & Sánchez-Chóliz, 2010; Mampiti & Rashid, 2006; Manresa & Sancho, 2004; Rodríguez, Llanes, & Cardenete, 2007; Sánchez-Chóliz, Duarte, & Mainar, 2007). In this context, this work constitutes an important methodological and empirical contribution to the scientific literature on ESAM and its applications. In this regard, in the literature there are no studies on the construction of hybrid matrices in the context of a regional geographic space like Yucatan and this work makes an original contribution to improve the regional information systems in Mexico that serve as the basis for decision making of sustainable public policy. In addition, an original methodological proposal is presented to integrate the use of groundwater, energy consumption and GHG emission to the monetary social accounting framework. In addition, the proposed decomposition of accounting multipliers allows us to discern the implications of the productive structure of the local economy in the generation and distribution of income among households and their environmental consequences. In this regard, the novelty of the paper is to present an original multiplier decomposition focused on evaluating the (in) sustainable performance of the economy of a particular territory at a given time based on the proposal of Thorbecke and Jung (1996). The present work is structured as follows. After a brief introduction, section 2 is devoted to the main information about construction and structure of the ESAM and also, the description of the data and sources of information that fed this work. Section 3 presents the methodological proposal for the decomposition of accounting multipliers to estimate the total effects of an exogenous change in the aggregate demand of the local economy on the distribution of household income, use of groundwater, energy consumption and emission of GHG. Next, section 4 discusses the main results of the analysis in the four topics addressed and in the Section 5 a synthesis is presented as a conclusion. In order to construct the model that allowed analysing the articulations of the social, economic and environmental system, first, a system of regional accounts in monetary terms was elaborated through indirect methods of estimation (Harris, 2002; Jackson, 1998). The monetary system of regional accounts for the economy of Yucatan (corresponding to 2003) consists of: supply and use tables, input–output domestic matrix (industry by industry) and a monetary SAM. 1 The monetary SAM disaggregates the accounts associated with households by income decile. 2 SAM was balanced using the cross-entropy method (Robinson, Cattaneo, & El-Said, 2001; Robinson & El-Said, 2000). On the other hand, vectors of natural resources and emissions to the atmosphere, both in physical units, were integrated in the monetary SAM. Information on the use of groundwater was obtained from the database of the Public Registry of Water Rights (REPDA, acronym in Spanish), an information system administered by CONAGUA [National Water Council] (2010). The available data are the volumes of groundwater in m3 per year allocated for productive use classified by type of use. 3 In 2003, a total of 10,774 titles had been granted for productive use. A reclassification of water uses had to be made to its respective SCIAN (North American Industry Classification System -NAICS) code (INEGI, 2002) in order to integrate the information into the SAM framework. In the integration of the coefficient vector aw the volumes of gross extraction of granted groundwater are taken. 4 Coefficients populating matrices of energy consumption and GHG emissions (Ae and Ag respectively) were calculated based on information from the State Emissions Inventory of Greenhouse Gases (SEDUMA-CICY, 2013). Information only took the fossil fuel consumption of the energy category of the inventory as well as direct and indirect GHG emissions by this source category. Consumption of fossil fuels comprises the stationary combustion (power generation, manufacturing industry and construction), mobile sources (motor transport, air, rail, maritime) and other sources. 5 Fuels reported by the inventory are diesel, fuel oil, natural gas, LP gas, coke, marine diesel, jet fuel and gasoline) in units of terajoules (Tj) and direct GHG emissions: CO2, CH4 and N2O and indirect ones: CO, NMVOC and NOx in units of gigagrams (Gg). The classification of inventory activities does not strictly correspond to the SCIAN classification of activities so it had to be reclassified according to the second. The integration of monetary information regarding the SAM and vectors into physical units of groundwater use, energy consumption by type of fuel and the emission of direct and indirect Greenhouse Gases in the same matrix (ESAM). Information on groundwater use in m3, energy in terajoules and GHG emission in gigagrams is only available for the productive activities sector, therefore, the ESAM records the use of groundwater and energy consumption as intermediate inputs in the process of production and the emission of GHG as a byproduct of productive activities to the environment. By adding to the monetary SAM the vectors of natural resources and emissions of pollutants the inflows of the natural system are incorporated to the economy (underground aquifer water and energy consumption as inputs of production), as well as the flows of output economic system to the natural system (emissions to the atmosphere). The ESAM is developed for 2003 as the base year 6 and the structure is presented in Table 1. The economic endogenous accounts have been classified as productive factors (18 categories of labour and another account denominated other factors), institutions (10 categories of households stratified by deciles of income, companies, regional government) and production activities (19 productive activities grouped and classified according to SCIAN). 7 In the linear model used, the exogenous accounts are: central government (Public Administration), Savings-investment and Rest of the world. 8 The SAM has a dimension of 53 × 53 rows and columns. 9 yi row totals represent the revenues of the endogenous accounts, the values of the exogenous accounts are represented by xi, system leaks are represented by lj, and since income (row totals) are equal to expenses (column totals), the expenditure of the endogenous accounts are given by yi´. Endogenous accounts are determined by changes occurring in the exogenous accounts and intensity of integration of supply and demand factor, input and product markets of the local economy. Flows into the endogenous accounts are unbundled and represented by the submatrices Tij. Matrix T13 expresses payment flow of the industries (production activities) to labour and other factors for services provided during the production process; the matrix T21 is the distribution of salaries, wages and other income to different institutions; T22 represents transfers among households, regional government and enterprises (including social benefits, taxes, etc.); T32 is the consumption of goods and services by households and the regional government; T33 is the demand for raw materials by productive activities. Since tij = aijyj then we have , thus the revenues of an i endogenous account (yi) are given by multiplying the coefficients of average expenditure (aij) of the i account and the total cost of the endogenous accounts yj ∀ j = 1, …, n ( plus the value of the exogenous injection given by xi. In the matricial form, yn = Anyn + x, from which yn = (I − A)−1x is obtained. 9 The matrix (I − A)−1 is called accounting multipliers matrix, that is, it indicates how a unit increase in exogenous demand of the central government, the rest of the world and saving-investment affects household income, companies, regional government, factors and productive activities, that is, dy = (I − A)−1dx. The components of the matrix represent submatrices of mean propensities among the different accounts that compose it. 10 A13 represents the average payments of industries to production factors; A21 means the average payments of various factors to institutions; A22 is the average propensities of transfers between institutions; A32 the average expenditure of institutions in locally manufactured products, and A33 is the average spending of industries in intermediate inputs at a local level. The breakdown of interactions at the sub-account level allows us to analyse the importance of each component of the economic system and its impact on the social and environmental systems. D = (I − A22)−1A21A13(I − A33)−1 and F = A32, Let mij = rijdij, where i represents the type of household, j is the productive sector, r the consumption-production-income integration effect, d is the distributional effect and m is the income-production accounting multiplier. Since mij and dij have the same dimension, then rij = mij/dij, that is, consumption-production-income integration effect. This is done in order to compare the magnitude of the effects and to be able to determine which is the one that contributes the most in household income. As we can see, the consumption-production-income integration effect and the income-consumption-production integration effect close the circuit of effects in the algebraic formulations of total effects. The integration effect is linked to the integration of supply with demand in each of the factor, input and output markets in the economy. One hypothesis of this work is that the greater the integration between demand and supply, the higher the income of households, but the greater the use of natural resources and the emission of GHG. Impacts on the use of natural resources, gas emissions and household incomes are presumably linked by the two types of integration effects, in addition to the distributive and productive effects. The local economy in 2003 is characterized by a high concentration of household income in the upper decile (X) (Table 2). At national level, the situation is similar (Credit Suisse, 2014; Esquivel, 2015). At the national and local levels, a large part of the population is excluded from advancement in economic and social well-being such as the Mayan indigenous population in Yucatan, 13 being inequality in income distribution extreme and resulting in broad social, political and economic implications. This inequality stems from the high dependence on labour wages of households on the lower decile (therefore more linked to local labour markets), meanwhile in the upper decile, revenues have a greater source of diversification linked mainly to capital. 14 Interactions included in the SAM model used provide results about household income due to an exogenous change in the final demand by productive activity and type of effect (Table 3). The distribution effect is less than one and has an average value of 70 cents, that is, for each peso that increases the exogenous demand for a good in the economy, household income increases by 70 cents on average. This effect is the result of remuneration for the factors that intervened in the production of the good, the requirements of production and the structure of income redistribution determined by the economic structure and social policy of the federal and state government. On the other hand, the integration effect is greater than one, has an average value of 1.74 pesos, because the income generated is spent on local goods and products that generate new rounds of impacts on factor incomes and households. 14 The total effect, given by the product of the distribution effect and the integration effect, is dampened by the distribution effect (Table 3). In addition, the distribution effect determines the total effect since the activities whose distribution effect is higher than the average are those whose total effect is higher than the average (except for the trade sector). The total effect amounts to 1.22 pesos. The activities with the highest total effects above average are the following 14: MINING (21), FINAN (52), PROFSERVI (54) SUPPORT (56), EDUCA (61), HEALTH (62), RECREATION (71), ACCOMMOD (72), OTHERS (81) and GOVERNMENT (93). Table 4 shows the average effect on household income by household decile and type of effect. The distributive effect varies in the opposite direction to the integration effect but since the distributive effect has a greater weight than that it determines the behaviour of the total effect. A significant finding is that households of the upper decile (Home10) receive 25 times more than the households of the lower decile (Home1) (0.625 and 0.025 respectively) for each peso that increases the exogenous demand of the economy. Main part of this effect is due to the distributive effect, because local productive activities pay poorly to the most disadvantaged households. Moreover, the integration effect indicates that households in the bottom decile spend a significant part of their income in locally manufactured products unlike households in the top decile consuming products imported in greater proportion to those. 14 This is due to the fact that the integration effect is decreasing as the socioeconomic level of households increases. In Table A2 in the Appendix, the total effect is presented by type of productive activity and by household decile. One can see that the pattern of the total effect is predominantly increased for the same activity as we move deciles of lower to higher income. The activities with the highest total income effects of a wide range of household belonging to deciles II-VIII are ACCOMMOD (72) and OTHERS (81). The sectors of MINING (21), RECREATION (71), PROFSERVI (54), EDUCATE (61) HEALTH (62) and GOVERNMENT (93), have important effects on total household income of the IX–X deciles that far exceed the amounts of the impact on households of lower deciles. In short, the local economy has minimal impacts on household incomes in the bottom decile and high impacts on income of the top decile. Households in the lower deciles do not benefit from the boost to the local economy through demand and differences exacerbate the gaps between households. Productive activities of the local economy represent a use of 589,115,629 m3 of groundwater self-supplied to 2003 (REPDA). The main direct user of water is the agricultural sector with 93.80% of the total, 15 followed in importance by the manufacturing sector with 2.75% and the electric power generation sector with 2.48% of the total. The agricultural sector is unquestionably the most important of the local economy to ensure sustainable use of water in productive activities. 16 Production and consumption perspectives differ regarding the use of self-supplied groundwater for productive use. Two uses are distinguished: direct from the point of view of production and the total from the point of view of final demand. Direct use is determined by the volumes allocated in m3 for productive use. Total use is determined by the final demand of commodities from exogenous accounts. Total use consists of two effects: the productive one gestating in terms of production and the integration effect reproduced throughout the economic system. The productive use comprises the direct use linked to the production of goods and the indirect one linked to the use of water incorporated in the required production of commodities inputs. 17 Meanwhile integration effect comprises the use of water due to the effects of the distribution and redistribution of income in local economic system that determines the demand for products that incorporate water in their production. Table 5 shows the results of direct and total use and the breakdown of the latter in the production and integration effects. Direct use of a productive activity is less than productive, integration and overall effect because the last three comprise the first and, additionally, incorporate indirect and induced effects of the economic system. The two activities major direct users of locally self-supplied groundwater are agricultural sector and manufacturing sector (obviously, largest value corresponds to agriculture: 82,123 m3 of per one million pesos increase in the value of production activity). Productive (direct + indirect) Relative to the total use, for some activities, productive effects are greater than integration. The productive effect of the agricultural sector is the most important, followed by manufacturing sector and electric power generation, both far behind the first. It is the main cause of the high demand for the resource in these three activities. For the other sectors, the production effect is marginal. The integration effect income-consumption-production is higher than the productive effect on activities other than the agricultural, manufacturing and power generation, which use water for production; the integration effect involves the use of groundwater comprising the rebound effect in productive activities of increased remuneration of production factors and of households demanding goods and services for consumption which in turn have to be produced by industries. In Table 5 can see that the range of the integration effect is narrow as it goes up to 7,784 at a minimum of 3,511 m3. Relative to the total use, the three activities with the highest total effects on self-supplied groundwater (per million pesos to increase the corresponding exogenous demand) are: agricultural sector (87,145 m3 per million pesos to increase the exogenous demand for this activity); the electric power generation sector (8,771 m3) and manufacturing (8,331 m3). For these activities, the production effect is having greater weight in the total use of groundwater and is the main cause of high natural resource use. In short, the productive use of water in the agricultural sector accounts for 94.41% of total use in that sector. In the electric power generation sector accounts for 54.51% and 57.84% of the manufacturing total use. Therefore, given the importance of water in the three activities, a sustainable water policy must focus their actions in promoting more efficient use of water in production processes in such activities. If a more sustainable economy is wanted, it should be promoted a more efficient water use in technical terms. Fossil fuels used in the local economy account for direct consumption of 88,619.17 Tj of energy in the local economy in 2005. The main fuel is natural gas with 34.91% of the total energy; secondly, diesel with 30.92% and gasoline with 23.08% as the third most important. Other types of fuels have a marginal participation. The electric power generation sector directly consumes 60.17% of the total energy, which is based on consumption of natural gas, diesel and fuel oil. The transport sector is the second largest with 34.48% of the total and its main fuels are gasoline and diesel. These two sectors account for 94.65% of total direct energy consumption of the economy. Therefore, the sustainable development of the local economy depends on the efficiency of energy consumption in these two sectors. Table A3 shows the total effects on energy consumption by production activity and type of fuel. The sector that has the greatest overall impact on diesel consumption, fuel oil and natural gas in the local economy is electric power generation with 5.2184, 0.9303 and 7.9094 Tj. 17 Transport is the main sector in the consumption of marine diesel, jet fuel and gasoline. LP gas consumption, to a greater extent, is represented by the accommodation and manufacturing sectors as the activities with greater overall impact on consumption of this fuel in the local economy. Coke consumption is represented by the manufacturing activity as the activity presenting the greatest impact. The productive effect (Table A4) is the main cause of energy consumption in the economy. In particular, in the sector of electric power generation, the nature of their production processes in which a significant amount of fossil fuels (natural gas, diesel and fuel oil, in that order) is required, which demonstrates the high dependence on this sector on fossil fuels to continue operating and meet the production requirements of other industries. In this sector, the productive effect on the consumption of natural gas, diesel and fuel oil is greater than the integration effect. In the transport sector, the same applies but in relation to consumption of gasoline, jet fuel and marine diesel. The manufacturing and hosting services sector has the same pattern but in relation to the consumption of coke and LPG. All other sectors of the local economy have greater integration effects in all fuel types. The electric power generation sector is the main source of direct, indirect and induced consumption of energy in the local economy with 14.2957 Tj per million pesos to increase exogenous demand for this sector. The other dimension of the problem of fossil fuels is that its combustion emits GHG. Local productive activities use fossil fuels in their production processes generating GHG into the atmosphere and contribute to global warming phenomenon. In 2005, the local economy issued 6,006.28 Gg CO2 eq representing 1.56% of national GHG emissions in Mexico in units of Gg CO2 eq by burning fossil fuels. 18 The CO2 represents 99.52% of the total of GHG emissions in units of Gg CO2 eq. The gases CH4 and N2O have a marginal share, even though its warming potential is higher than that. The electric power generation sector issues the 57.58% of CO2 eq. and the transport sector reports the 35.89% of the total. The other industries have marginal units. Regarding the indirect GHG, tropospheric ozone precursors, the transport sector is the largest contributor in this sense with 59.37% of the emissions of NOx, 99.26% of CO and 98.84% of NMVOC. Table 6 shows total effect of emissions generated per million pesos to increase the exogenous demand for each activity. 19 Regarding CO2, main effects correspond to the electric power generation sector (0.9262 Gg CO2 eq) and transport sector (0.2604 Gg CO2 eq). In relation to CH4 emissions, the same two activities stand out with 0.0010 Gg CO2 eq for both. Relative to N2O, the highlighting activity is the electric power generation with 0.0024 Gg CO2 eq. In the emission of NOx, the electric power generation sector and transport stands out in the first with 0.0036 Gg and 0.0022 Gg, respectively, as the most important. 20 In relation to CO and NMVOC, the transportation sector is the largest source of emissions in the economy (0.0178 Gg and 0.0033 Gg respectively). Summarizing, the main emission source of direct GHG (CO2 as the major gas in terms of absolute emissions) on the local economy is the electric power generation sector which represents a significant portion of the emissions from energy fossil combustion. This sector stands out in the emission of direct gases: CO2, CH4, N2O and also in indirect gases: NOx. Regarding indirect GHG emissions, the most important sector is transport, although this sector is the second largest direct GHG emitter, right behind the electric power generation sector. Transport stands out in direct GHG emissions: in emissions CH4 and indirect gases: CO and NMVOC. In the overall economy, the main GHG is CO2 in terms of absolute emissions and the main emission source is the electric power generation. The productive effect on both emission sources: electric power generation and transport is the main cause of the emission of gases to the atmosphere (Table A5). That is, both activities generate large amounts of greenhouse gases due to the nature of their production processes based on combustion of large amounts of fossil energy source. In all other activities, the integration effect has greater weight in determining GHG emissions. The ESAM is a kind of snapshot in a geographical area (Yucatan) that captures the relations of economic, social and environmental system. 19 The relations of the social and economic system are captured following the path of circular flow of income in monetary units and the relations of the environmental-economic system by the environmental impact of production and consumption activities expressed in physical units. Integration of monetary and physical information in a single accounting framework results in hybrid information that partially satisfies the requirements of strong sustainability approach driven by the school of thought of the ecological economy. The integrated information system in ESAM 2003 served as the basis for estimating accounting multipliers to derive the impacts on natural systems (groundwater, energy from fossil sources, emissions pollutants into the atmosphere) and social ones (generation and distribution of income) that sustain the economic system for continuous reproduction. The results obtained here provide evidence of unsustainable performance of the local economy for several reasons: the economic structure widens the gap between rich and poor households; inefficient groundwater use in agriculture and presumably in the electric power generation and manufacturing productive use; economy based on fossil fuels from non-renewable sources that generate greenhouse gases into the atmosphere with global impacts. In the social dimension, the local economic structure and pattern of income redistribution are the most important variables in household income. The household income determines the spending in the local economy and its level and composition has important implications for economic dynamics. The household income of the lower deciles consists largely of remuneration to the labour, which are characterized by corresponding to a minimum subsistence wage, unlike top decile households, which derived greater extent of income from capital and high salaries. In this sense, the results of this study suggest that the option of establishing a progressive fiscal policy, which taxes at higher rates capital income and to a lesser extent labour income combined with a social policy of transfers to employees households, would contribute to the reduction of economic gaps between households. With these changes in the orientation of fiscal and social policies, they strengthen aggregate demand and economic dynamics lead to reducing gaps between households. Local aggregate demand would be strengthened and the economic dynamics would lead to reducing gaps between households. Regarding the use of groundwater, the results suggest that the productive use is the major factor in the sustainable management of water resources. Therefore, given the importance of groundwater in the agricultural, manufacturing and electric power generation sectors, a sustainable water policy must focus their actions in promoting more efficient use of groundwater in production processes such as those activities. If it is wanted an economy with sustainable local development, the research results suggest that an environmental policy focused on the most efficient use of water in technical terms (economic) mainly in the agricultural sector, it is needed to ensure management in line with the principles of Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, as in the case of groundwater, productive consumption is the leading cause of energy (fossil) consumption in productive sectors in the economy of Yucatan. Particularly, in the sector of electric power generation and road transport sectors, they represent the two largest direct and total energy consumers of fossil energy both determined by the production requirements of the prevailing technology in these sectors. These results provide direction in the general guidelines of a sustainable energy policy aimed at promoting the efficient consumption of energy in the above sectors and according to the availability of fossil fuels on a long-term time horizon sectors. At the same time, sustainable energy management includes the development of alternative sources of renewable energy that can replace the energy consumption of non-renewable sources. With regard to GHG emissions, the activities of electric power generation and transportation represent the two sectors with the largest GHG emissions into the atmosphere and productive consumption is the most important factor in this situation again. That is, both activities emit large amounts of GHG due to the nature of their production processes based on combustion of large amounts of fossil energy source. Based on the research results, sustainable policy options point to promote efficient production processes in the consumption of fossil fuels and transition to fuel sources that shed less pollutants into the atmosphere. For the local economy, the sector of electric power generation is the activity that largely determines the little sustainable performance of the local economy, in relation to energy consumption, GHG generation and to a lesser extent the use of groundwater. It is the sector that represents the most important challenge in the dynamics of the transition of the economy along the path of sustainable local development. For its part, agriculture plays an important role in the sustainable management of the economy as a strategic sector in the provision of food, but being little sustainable in its use of groundwater for the abuse and waste of natural resources. A constructive policy towards the sustainable development would place greater emphasis on productive restructuring the agricultural sector and electric power generation, in designing actions of technological change and sustainable natural resource management. Productive reconversion of activities along with tax policies levied further capital income and income redistribution through transfer mechanisms to households that depend on income from wage labour, would help to set up an economy a less unsustainable performance, at least on a short-term time horizon and in the right direction in the transition to more sustainable development actions. In the short term, they would be taking steps in the right direction, but in the medium and long term these actions are not enough to ensure sustainable natural resource management. The local ecosystem requires action to put in balance the demand and supply of local biocapacity in meeting the needs of the population entity. The biggest challenge is not the short term, the most difficult battle is to co-ordinate development actions in a long-term involving intergenerational co-ordination of actions in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the European Commission.","This research focuses on the state of Yucatan, Mexico, and provides evidence of unsustainable performance of the local economy: the local economic structure and income distribution widens the gap between rich and poor households. A constructive policy towards sustainable development would place greater emphasis on productive restructuring the agricultural sector, road transport and electric power generation, in designing actions of technological change and sustainable natural resource management.

Indianapolis, IN: JIST Publishing 256 pages, $19.95, Softcover Intended Audience(s): A, B, C, D, F, G, H Major Headings from the Table of Contents: Understanding Your Family Business Issues; Meeting the Lifelong Challenges in a Family Business; Facing the Challenges as a Young Adult in the Family Business; Confronting the Ongoing Challenges in Your Career; Becoming a Professional How Is the Book Most Useful for Its Intended Audience? It is one of the few resources available for the younger generation struggling with life decisions; specifically if/when it is right to enter the family business, and what that means for the future. The Top Five Things You Learned from Reading this Book: More than 80 per cent of all businesses in North America are family businesses. One out of every 10 households owns a business. During the next 20 years, almost all family-owned businesses will lose their primary owner to death or retirement. These losses will lead to the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in U.S. history. The average CEO of a large publicly traded company stays at the company less than 6 years, but the average CEO of a family business is in charge for 24 years! For the CEOs of family businesses, their positions are not just jobs-they are their lives, identities, and missions. Author's definition of social intelligence: While you are in school, more than 80 per cent of your success is determined by your technical competence, and less than 20 per cent is determined by social intelligence. Beginning the day you graduate, that equation reverses itself. On the job, about 80 per cent of your success is determined by your social intelligence, and only 20 per cent is determined by your technical competence-but no one tells you this! Out of every 100 family businesses started, only 33 or so are still owned by the family in the second generation. Of the family businesses that do make it successfully to the second generation, only 30 per cent of those successfully transition to the third generation. Family businesses tend to fail for two main reasons: lack of planning and lack of preparing. Author's definition of success: Success is having a career that aligns who you are and what you value with the best benefits the market has to offer. When Your Parents Sign the Paychecks is a thorough resource for any students struggling with decision-making about the future. Reading the book is a start, but the real professionals will invest the necessary 20-40 hours to complete the McCann Action Plan for Life Outline (MAP for Life) in the Appendix. McCann has readers work through eight challenges young people face when deciding to enter the family business: Improving social intelligence; Handling wealth and power; Earning credibility; Writing your own script; Planning your career; Including the family business in your education; Gaining marketability; and Getting objective feedback. …",,,false,,false,,

With the intergenerational occupational mobility in farming sector, the present study was carried out from July 2016 to March 2017 with a perceptual and comparative analysis among the respondents of coastal district (Jagatsinghpur) and tribal district (Mayurbhanj) of Odisha state of India with the total sample of 240 respondents out of which 120 each from tribal and coastal selected through proportionate random sampling in an intention to find out the structural and technological change in accordance with intergenerational occupational mobility in farming sector in tribal and coastal districts of Odisha. The result found that the present generation witnessed decrease in average land holding of 0.08 ha in tribal district and 0.11 ha in coastal district with respect to previous generation. Most of the tribal farmers (47.50%) remained in lower level of change in extension participation whereas most of the coastal farmers (39.17%) remained in the medium level of change in extension participation. Majority of tribal farmers (40.83%) remained at lower level while majority of coastal farmers (42.50%) placed in medium level of change in accessing modern technologies like line sowing, INM, HYVs, Hybrids, IFS, drip irrigation etc.",,Anshuman Jena; Kajal Srichandan; A.

Over 90% of adolescents live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but data needed to inform policies and programs that address the unique developmental and health needs of adolescents in LMICs are limited. Population-based data surveillance such as Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) and school-based surveys provide unique opportunities to address this gap by collecting population-representative longitudinal data on adolescent health and well-being. The Africa Research Implementation Science and Education (ARISE) Network therefore systematically developed adolescent health and well-being indicators and a questionnaire that can be used in such settings through a multistage collaborative and iterative consultation process with network members and health-domain and adolescent health experts globally. Six key domains emerged from this process: health awareness and behaviors; nutrition; mental health; sexual and reproductive health; substance use; and healthcare utilization. For each domain, we generated a clear definition; rationale for inclusion; sub-domain descriptions, and a set of questions for measurement. The ARISE Network will test these tools longitudinally at ten sites in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa and two countries in Asia. Integrating these tools within established population-based data collection platforms such as HDSS and school settings can complement other data on adolescent health and well-being and provide standardized data for policy and program planning and evaluation in LMICs.Funding: The Botnar Foundation (Grant #INV-037672) financially supports this work through a grant.

Although a large majority of family businesses are managed by senior family members who are older than age 55 and more than 80 percent of such senior family members claim that they want the business to remain in the family, less than 30 percent of such businesses have tackled the challenge of developing a plan for transitioning the business to the next generation. For over 90 percent of such families, this planning challenge is aggravated by the fact that they have no diversified wealth: the family's wealth is the business. This article examines the technical challenges of designing such a transition plan that meets the specific objectives of the family, including the family's tolerance for complexity. Through the use of a simple case study, this article reviews essential elements that should be carefully evaluated in the design of any transition plan and explains numerous technical traps that must be avoided in the plan design. These elements and the related traps include timing considerations, valuation discounts, marital deduction planning, life insurance structuring, entity limitation and conversion options, compensation opportunities, and co-shareholder planning. The comparative benefits and inherent limitations of alternative transition strategies and business restructuring options are also illustrated, including the complexities and unique challenges of incorporating advanced estate planning strategies into the plan design. The article explains and illustrates why certain popular estate tax savings strategies, including the grantor retained annuity trust, the intentionally defective grantor trust installment sale, the self-canceling installment note, and the family partnership, often become problematic, inadvisable, or merely supplemental when the bulk of the family's wealth is tied up in a valuable family business. The tax benefits, challenges, and risks of each of these strategies and others are explained, along with the practical problems that surface with a family business. The article also explores alternative strategies for anticipating and resolving conflicting interests between children who work in the business and children who have no career ties to the business. The purpose of the article is help professionals better understand the importance, magnitude, and difficulty of the intergenerational transition challenges of family-dominated businesses. As the article demonstrates, these are not challenges that can be met with stock solutions or quick fixes. Each situation requires a custom, strategic plan that, when implemented wisely over an appropriate period of time, addresses the core objectives of the family and avoids destructive traps and useless complexities. The ultimate goal is to design a plan that effectively incorporates a mix of strategies that accomplish the highest priority objectives at a level of complexity that works for the family. I. INTRODUCTION-MOUNTAIN OR MARBLES Mom and Dad have labored a lifetime building a profitable business that services a market niche and regularly delivers a paycheck to two hundred hard-working employees. On paper, most would consider them rich, but they fully appreciate that the bulk of their wealth is tied up in a business operation that could be derailed by changing market conditions, a breakthrough technology, a new tenacious competitor, sloppy management, or a host of other factors. They have witnessed the demise of other businesses that were all considered rock solid at some point in their existence. The time has come for Mom and Dad to slow down, turn over the reins, and enjoy their retirement. One child is immersed in the business, fully prepared and anxious to run the show, and two other children are off pursing other careers. The family wants a plan that will ensure the parents' financial security, treat all children fairly, protect the business, promote family harmony, and minimize all tax bites. …",,,false,,false,,

We estimate effects by gender and focus on behaviors that are important for socioeconomic and health trajectories and represent early observable consequences of the reforms for the next generation.Using two nationally-representative datasets, we exploit differences in welfare reform implementation across states and over time in a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework to identify plausibly causal effects of welfare reform on a range of prosocial and antisocial behaviors (volunteering, participating in clubs/teams/activities, skipping school, getting into fights, damaging property, stealing, hurting others, smoking, using alcohol, using marijuana, using other illicit drugs). We explore maternal employment, supervision, and child's employment when not in school as potential mediators. We find that:(1) Welfare reform had no favorable effects on any of the youth behaviors examined. (2) Welfare reform led to a decrease in volunteering among girls. (3) Welfare reform led to increases in skipping school, damaging property, and getting into fights among boys. (4) Welfare reform led to increases in smoking and drug use among both boys and girls, with generally larger effects for boys (e.g., approximately 6% for boys compared to 4% for girls for any substance use). (5) The mediators we are able to consider explain little of the observed effects of welfare reform.Overall, the results from this study suggest that the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable, particularly for boys, and do not support longstanding arguments that incentivizing maternal employment by limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation. As such, the social gains of welfare reform for women found in previous studies may have come at a cost to the next generation, particularly to boys who have been falling behind girls in terms of high school completion for decades.",Error fetching abstract,,false,,false,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/196706/1/dp12208.pdf

The statement is expected to provide benefits to members, to members' valuation clients, to third parties who rely on valuation reports, and to the general business valuation community. * The statement allows for two types of engagements: the valuation engagement and the calculation engagement. The statement allows for several types of valuation reports. For a valuation engagement, two types of reports are permitted: a detailed report and a summary report. For a calculation engagement, one type of report is permitted: a calculation report. For all engagements, oral reports are permitted. * The statement applies to engagements to estimate value when the member (1) applies valuation approaches and methods and (2) uses professional judgment in that application. Based on years of deliberation and debate encompassing numerous groups within the AICPA, the statement provides members, clients and parties who rely on member valuation services with professional guidance, structured valuation service levels and well-defined valuation reporting options. ********** CPAs perform valuation services for numerous purposes, including transactions, financings, taxation planning and compliance, intergenerational wealth transfer, ownership transition, financial accounting, bankruptcy, management information, and planning and litigation support. In June, the AICPA Consulting Services Executive Committee issued the Institute's first professional guidance to members who provide valuation services, Statement on Standards for Valuation Services (SSVS) no. 1, Valuation of a Business, Business Ownership Interest, Security, or Intangible Asset. This article summarizes the content and intent of the statement related to valuation engagement considerations, valuation development guidance and valuation reporting requirements. It also outlines the practical application (and practical implications) of the statement. The statement, which is effective for valuation engagements accepted after Jan. 1, 2008, is expected to: 1. Provide members with professional guidance related to best practices in valuation services. 2. Allow members who provide tax-related valuations to comply with accepted appraisal standards as required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. 3. Improve the quality and consistency of valuation practices. 4. Enhance the transparency and replicability of valuation analyses and reports. 5. Encourage the standardization of valuation analysis data gathering and valuation report content and formats. 6. Recognize what are (and are not) generally accepted valuation approaches and methods. 7. Enhance the reliance on the valuation process by clients, judicial finders of fact, the investment community and others. 8. Encourage a clear, documented understanding between members and clients as to (a) the level of valuation service and (b) the type of valuation report. Exhibit 1 presents the Top 10 expected benefits. Exhibit 1 Expected Benefits Associated With the Statement Expected Client Benefits 1. Clients can reach a clear understanding with the valuation analyst regarding the level of valuation service to be performed. The statement provides Dr well-defined alternative types of valuation development analyses. 2. Clients can reach a clear understanding with the valuation analyst regarding the type of valuation report (that is, engagement deliverable). …",,,false,,false,,

America were invited by regional representatives to comment on the economics of health care for children because it relates to their region. The series of articles that follow this introduction reflect what each author believed was relevant. Two of the articles are written by economists at The London School of Economics and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and delineate the role of health care in economic development; whereas, the other articles express the views of physicians in specific regions about the effects of economic development on individual or community health issues. Although it is true that intellectual genius is not related to economic or social status, societies benefit when the abilities of children are recognized and supported through education and opportunity, access to affordable health care for all children increases individual productivity, and economic empowerment of women improves children's health, there are no data to support the hypothesis that investing in children's health ultimately improves a country's economy. It would seem reasonable to believe that improving health care for children would result in their becoming better educated, reaching their intellectual potential, and being more productive, all of which in turn would result in economic improvement. Physicians who, by training, focus on the needs of an individual child find this worldview to be consistent with their beliefs, but economists who have a broader view of factors that affect economic development realize that health care for children is but one factor of economic success. Although investment in children's health has not yet been shown to directly affect economic growth, such an investment may not demonstrate benefit for decades. Allocation of modest resources to childhood health care may not be sufficient to affect an economy. The experiment may require a bold and comprehensive program to maximize impact. Both physicians and economists agree that the argument to support health care for children and to empower women need not be justified by an economic benefit to society, but rather is laudable on its own merits. Additional studies may be needed to convince governments that investing in health care for children and women will “trickle up” to improve the lives of all of the citizens and validate the expression once used by President John F. Kennedy, “A rising tide lifts all boats.” HOW CAN WE IMPROVE POLICIES TO PROMOTE CHILDREN'S HEALTH IN EUROPE? Elias Mossialos and Huseyin Naci Children's health is influenced by socioeconomic status as well as physical and socioemotional environments. To promote and improve children's health in Europe, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes a life-course approach, which aims to address the health challenges at each stage of development from prenatal life to adolescence (1). This translates to 7 areas for action, including maternal and newborn health, nutrition, communicable diseases, injuries and violence, physical environment, adolescent health, and psychosocial development and mental health. Meeting the objectives of a life-course approach poses significant challenges to health systems because it necessitates multisectorial commitment, which spans across agriculture, education, transport, and social care sectors. Improving policies to promote children's health in Europe requires a different philosophy, or a reconfiguration of the health system, to allow for better coordination with other sectors. Health systems have traditionally favored the treatment of illness and disease rather than the promotion of future health. The failure to address the risk factors in early life of serious chronic illnesses such as obesity is likely to increase the medical costs associated with these conditions later on. Children who are obese, for instance, are likely to be obese adults, substantially increasing their risk for costly comorbidities such as type II diabetes mellitus (2). A multisectorial life-course approach is justified on the basis that promoting children's health would have the potential of reducing the future costs not only to health care, but also to education and social welfare systems. Intuitively, there are pathways that provide a link between children's health status and educational and economic outcomes. Improvements in children's health can lead to improvements in educational outcomes, the prevention of irreversible harm to future economic contribution to society, and given the strong relation between poor health and income level, the mitigation of the intergenerational transmission of poverty (3). A multisectorial approach that embraces the life-course approach is increasingly the focus of policymaking across European settings. The Finnish government, for example, prioritizes health promotion that spans across physical and socioemotional environments, that is, lifestyles, living environment, and quality of products (4). Similarly, the “Healthy Lives, Brighter Futures” framework, the UK government's children's health strategy, aims to achieve easier access to health services to improve not only physical health but also psychosocial well-being in the form of universal, targeted, and specialist support across 3 life stages: early years and pregnancy, school-age children, and young people (5). An important challenge facing decision makers in Europe is coordinating the efforts of various stakeholders and ensuring that they share the same incentives around the common goal of promoting and improving children's health. So far economic incentives, such as those in place for family practitioners in the UK, have been constrained to the health system. These so-called quality indicators (eg, screening for high blood pressure) are generally not applicable to children, and those that are (eg, management of type 1 diabetes mellitus) do not always address the greater social context. Extending the reach of these incentives to other sectors, and aligning the objectives across multiple stakeholders, remains an important policy objective in Europe. Given the complex methodologies required to evaluate interventions that span multiple sectors, there are inevitable limitations of the research efforts exploring the relation between children's health and wider economic and social outcomes (3,6). Reflecting the limitations of the existing data sources, studies adopt a short-term view, without taking into account the long-term costs and benefits; and often neglect important cost dimensions such as social benefits. To inform evidence-based policies, accurately capturing both costs and benefits associated with multisectorial interventions is essential. In this context, a number of country- or regional-level cohorts are collecting a wealth of longitudinal information on children's health and its determinants in Europe. Examples include the Amsterdam-born Children and their Development cohort in the Netherlands, the Norwegian Child and Mother Cohort study (7) in Norway, and the Newcastle Thousand Families Study in the UK. In an attempt to coordinate these efforts, a Europe-wide research strategy is emerging as a result of CHICOS (Developing a Child Cohort Research Strategy for Europe) (8). Funded by the European Commission, this effort is striving to develop a strategy for future research within European children's cohorts designed to improve evidence-based policy. These efforts provide an opportunity to measure the longitudinal effects of policy initiatives, and allow for a careful evaluation of the relation between children's health status and wider societal outcomes. A multisectorial life-course approach is needed to promote children's health and align system-wide incentives. Recent efforts to mobilize country- and regional-level data collection mechanisms will offer valuable evidence to evaluate policy initiatives in European countries. CHILDHOOD HEALTH AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES Amitabh Chandra This section reviews the relation between investing in health and later economic outcomes. Causal empiricism reveals 2 observations: healthier people are richer and richer countries are healthier, leading many commentators to believe that investments in health, especially in children, will yield economic benefits that are analogous to investments in schooling. As with early investments in human capital such as childhood enrichment programs, health capital is believed to pay off in the form of longer, healthier, and more productive lives. A child's intellectual and physiological development occurs early in life, suggesting that early setbacks may have deleterious effects on the ability to make future investments. The evidence on so-called critical periods for certain dimensions of development amplifies these concerns. Finally, there is a long tradition of assuming that what is true for individuals can be applied to larger aggregates such as states or countries. Distinguished commentators have argued that countries who pursue pro-natalist and pro-child investments would see large economic payoffs from their efforts to combat early insults such as malnutrition, diarrhea, and polio (9). The logic behind such reasoning is simple and intuitive, but the theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in support of it are far less obvious. Let us first focus on the child as an individual and ignore the arguments surrounding aggregating his or her experience to the nation. The first reason that the link between early health investments and later health is not immediate is the problem of competing risks. Put simply, there are multiple health risks that a child faces, and eliminating the most prevalent risk will not guarantee that a child will survive to adulthood—a child who is free of polio may still succumb to malaria, a child who is cured of polio and malaria may still contract hepatitis. Therefore, if policies that target children's health target individual diseases, as many efforts by developing countries and WHO do, the salubrious effects of health investments will be diluted. The dilution depends on the presence of these competing risks, which are likely more prevalent in poorer parts of the globe. This is also 1 reason why investing in slightly older children may yield higher health benefits than investing in infants, who are subject to more competing risks because of their inherent frailty. Economic theory offers another cautionary tale about the mechanism by which childhood health investments increase later earnings. The channel that economists emphasize is that better childhood health allows a child to learn faster and become stronger. In economic parlance, this is a productivity shock. Better health also may increase incentives to remain in school longer, but the gains from this channel will be second order relative to the direct effect of being healthier on earnings. This is because individuals select the number of years of schooling by comparing the benefits of more schooling to its costs. They may do so imperfectly, but better health only marginally alters their decision-making calculus. Moreover, better health can perversely increase incentives to drop out of school because of higher market wages, especially for physical work. The third reason is that the extrapolation from the individual to the population is fraught with pitfalls. In high-mortality environments, disease restricts the ability of a population to grow, but when a population grows (because of improvements in health), it reduces the capital per worker, and through this channel, the productivity of labor and, consequently, earning. Therefore, although improvements in individual health may increase individual earnings, the same logic may not aggregate up to the country level. Indeed, this is the key finding of Acemoglu and Johnson (10), who found that major health improvements in the 1940s (the international epidemiological transition) stemming from the widespread use of penicillin, streptomycin, and DDT, were successful in improving life expectancy, but these improvements in life expectancy did not increase income per capita, largely because of the offsetting increase in population. Taken together, these results lead economists to conclude that it is wrongheaded to argue that investments in health are a policy tool to improve economic outcomes. Rather, better health is an end in its own right and should be valued regardless of its effects on economic outcomes. In the spirit of this argument, Becker et al (11) demonstrate that the striking convergence in mortality between rich and poor countries, which is contrary to their income trajectories, did much to reduce the gap in human welfare between rich and poor countries. Good health means much more than higher incomes. It affects human capabilities and capacity to imagine, consume, and live. This is a sufficient motivation to invest in childhood health. AFRICA: ECONOMICS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY Haroon Salojee Sub-Saharan Africa makes up 11% of the world's population, accounts for 24% of the global disease burden, is home to only 3% of the global health workforce, but commands <1% of global health expenditure (12). Health care delivery infrastructure is inadequate, skilled health care workers and essential medicines are in short supply, and weak health information systems restrict appropriate responses. The health care financing system is as deficient as the health care delivery system it supports. It depends on a mélange of measly governmental spending, heavy (but dwindling) foreign donor assistance, and substantial reliance on user fees and out-of-pocket contributions that primarily disadvantage the poorest. With the lowest health spending in the world (averaging $24 per person annually in 2010 [WHO recommends at least $40]), countries cannot ensure universal access to even a limited set of health services. Africa's health care challenges are heightened by the sheer diversity of the continent. Weak economic growth, inefficient budgeting and spending, poor accountability, and corruption are a few of the immediate causes of the fiscal crisis. Budgetary stringency under health sector reforms that accompany structural adjustment programmes instituted by institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have handicapped many African governments’ ability to respond appropriately to citizens’ health needs. At the same time, inadequate investment in the health sector has paralyzed service delivery. In 2001, African governments agreed to allocate 15% of their budgets to health; to date, only 6 countries have met this commitment. Undoubtedly, the continent's greatest challenge is narrowing the inequity in access to care for the “have's” (privileged) and the “have not's” (ordinary citizens). Universal health schemes are returning to Africa. Countries such as Ghana, Rwanda, Gabon, and Senegal have led the way in pooling risk and transforming access to health care, with South Africa and Nigeria following suit. Ethiopia, for one, has demonstrated the power of strong political will to create a primary-care service virtually from scratch. Simultaneously, an emerging middle class, increasingly active private health care industry, and shifting disease burdens are transforming the way health care on the continent is being funded and delivered. Africa accounts for more than half of global maternal and child deaths, with infectious diseases predominating. Ensuring access to clean water and sanitation, battling ongoing communicable diseases, and stemming the tide of preventable deaths still dominate the health care agenda in most African settings. The last decade has seen significant progress in marshalling resources to tackle human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, malaria, and tuberculosis, as new donors and institutions have emerged; however, there is concern that this focus has negatively affected progress in other areas, such as diarrheal disease and malnutrition reduction. Although diseases such as HIV and malaria are inextricably linked to diarrhea and malnutrition, both causally and in their successful management, the fear that funds that primarily address the latter diseases have been diverted elsewhere needs to be allayed. The evidence for this is equivocal. In the case of childhood diarrhea, in the face of remarkable decreases in mortality globally, diarrhea has superseded pneumonia as the number one cause of under-5 mortality in Africa. Improvements in access to safe drinking water and sanitation have also stalled in Africa, making it difficult to combat stubbornly high levels of water-borne illnesses. A staggering 80% of African countries are presently unlikely to meeting the Millennium Development Goal sanitation target. More costly but still important have been the reductions in HIV-related morbidity through improved prevention of mother-to-child transmission strategies and antiretroviral therapy access, particularly in southern and east Africa. In the case of malnutrition, evidence of disease reduction is lacking. Underweight prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa has remained roughly the same during the last 2 decades. More than half of the children hospitalized with severe malnutrition in countries such as Malawi, South Africa, and Zambia are HIV infected. The difficulties of ensuring access to nutritious food for the most vulnerable in Africa have been compounded by a convergence of global trends: skyrocketing food prices; an increase in the number and intensity of weather-related disasters (eg, droughts); and an escalation of ongoing civil conflicts. Although billions of dollars of international assistance are labeled “food aid,” <2% is being spent on interventions targeted specifically at reducing malnutrition among children (13). Médecins Sans Frontières have raised the concern that wealthy countries are investing in long-term agriculture programmes at the expense of urgent measures to target food aid at the hungriest children (13). Where lies salvation for Africa's children? Extending universal health care coverage to Africa's poorest offers the best prospect for addressing equity and other issues. It takes the focus of health systems away from providing expensive, hospital-centric, and disease-focused care and reestablishes the premier position of primary health care and the importance of community-based activities. Reducing reliance on international aid organizations and giving local communities more control over health care resources is crucial for meaningful change, but historically has been difficult to institutionalize. Nevertheless, community-based ambulatory treatment of severe malnutrition is an example of how this kind of change can occur. Inpatient care of malnutrition in many African settings is now reserved for the most severe cases, with many children being managed at outpatient or clinic nutrition centers, or at home. Costs of this ambulatory community-based treatment have been consistently lower than that for institution-based treatment, ranging between US$46 and $453 per child, depending on the type of care provided and the costing methods used (14). At this price, the intervention is cost-effective compared with other priority health interventions in low-income African countries. Africa's health care systems are at a turning point. The crisis is as much political as fiscal. Governments must make tough choices and their decisions will be crucial to determining whether mortality rates remain crushingly high, or whether the “dark continent” illuminates a new path demonstrating how citizens’ basic needs, including health, can be met, and diseases such as diarrhea and malnutrition obliterated to clinical peculiarities. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC INSTABILITY ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH Yuichiro Yamashiro In the last 2 decades, at least 3 major economic crises have occurred. The Asian currency crisis in 1997, the so-called Lehman Shock in 2008, and the present European market crisis. Globalization is rapidly influencing events worldwide. More than three-quarters of the countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have experienced a growing gap between rich and poor during this period. Income inequality can damage health through 2 pathways. First, a highly unequal society implies that a substantial segment of the population is impoverished, and poverty is bad for health. Second, income inequality is thought to affect the health of not just the poor but also the better-off in society. The so-called spillover effects of inequality have in turn been attributed to the psychosocial stress resulting from social inequality (15). The fight by conservative forces in the United States against the bill to reform Medicaid is 1 example. Health care delivery in highly developed countries can be roughly divided into 2 systems: the European type and the US type. The former is based on the principle of universal coverage. It is operated by tax-financed organizations such as the National Health Service in the UK (16). It is offered to all of the members of the population in times of health care need, and it provides largely free care at the point of use and lends itself to the principle of equal access for equal need. The latter relies on the incentive mechanisms of the purchasers and providers of health care and is based purely on economic notions of competition, rather than regulation by the government (17). Although the European type has been modified and reformed in each country, their health outcomes have been satisfactory. This is in contrast to that in the United States, where the lack of a national health care system to provide universal coverage, together with the lack of health insurance in a large segment of the population (>50 million, including even 7.5 million children in 2009), has led to a health crisis (17,18). It is worth keeping in mind the notion that health is not a game; it is a public good, and thus health services should not be about competition; they should provide equity for all people, irrespective of their socioeconomic or demographic position. Patients are not treated as merely consumers. This is especially true for children. In other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development signatory nations, however, core objectives of the system also have not been performed smoothly. This is mainly because of income inequality. Care is no longer entirely free at the point of use for all health services because of various reasons, including the increasing cost of health care management. Health inequality is a serious and growing problem worldwide, even in Japan (19), where wealth inequality is still lower than in other highly developed countries, according to the Gini coefficient. Indeed, cost performance for health care service in Japan is extremely good. For example, in 2008 the total expenditures for health/capital, in US dollars, were 7720 in the United States, 3644 in Sweden, 3280 in the UK, and 2878 in Japan (20). Furthermore, the lowest infant mortality rate, the longest life expectancy, and the lowest obesity rate among both adults and children were in Japan. In highly developed countries, a lower level of education is associated with health inequalities. Lower education levels can lead to insecure income, hazardous work conditions, poor housing, and even psychosocial stresses, all of which can have a bad influence on children's environments for healthy growth. These factors cause higher rates of premature babies and of infant and child mortality, along with lower breast-feeding rates, leading to poor school performance, child abuse, and obesity with metabolic syndrome. There is no valid argument against giving a high priority to the health of mothers and children, yet women and children are particularly vulnerable to socioeconomic inequalities. Medicaid in nearly half of the states of the United States is almost collapsing (21). This is threatening children with chronic diseases and leading to a widening health gap between different social groups. What world medicine needs today to avoid the sacrifice of children's health is a new and stronger political voice. Medical professionals working for children's care should strengthen their professional moral responsibilities because they know that a more involved and motivated profession will lead to better outcomes for children with diseases, throughout the world. THE ECONOMICS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: ENSURING EQUITABLE ACTION FOR CHILD SURVIVAL Zulfiqar A. Bhutta Although there has been remarkable progress during the last decade in reducing the burden of child mortality, the rates of reduction in child deaths globally vary considerably. From an estimated 10 million deaths among children younger than 5 years annually in 2000 (22), now corrected to 9.6 million deaths, present figures indicate that there are 2.0 to 2.4 million fewer deaths ever year (23,24). There have been major reductions in childhood diarrhea-, pneumonia-, and measles-related deaths, and despite variations in malaria estimates (25), there has also been progress in reducing malaria-associated deaths; however, despite the reduction in the under-5 global mortality rate in children younger than 5 years to 57.1 from 73/1000 live births, progress across the globe remains variable. There are some varied estimates of gains over time and trends largely depending upon methodology used to derive estimates. The recent Countdown to 2015 initiative (26,27) reports that of 75 countries with >95% of the global burden of maternal, newborn, and child mortality, only 22 are on track to achieve Millennium Development Goal 4 and 13 (17%) have made little or no progress. Of the 7.6 million under-5 child deaths globally, despite progress there are still close to 2 million deaths due to diarrhea and pneumonia annually. In 2010, 64% (4.875 million) of all of the child deaths were attributable to infectious causes, and pneumonia (14%, 1.068 (uncertainty range [UR] 0.972–1.173 million) and diarrhea (10%, 0.748 (UR 0.532–1.026) million) accounted for almost one-quarter of all deaths. There were notable regional variations. The southeast Asia region was also heavily affected by childhood pneumonia, which was responsible for 22% (0.455 million, UR 0.357–0.550 million) of child deaths in the neonatal and postneonatal periods. In India alone, of the 1.682 million under-5 children child deaths in 2010, newborn deaths accounted for 52% of these deaths, whereas pneumonia (0.394 million, UR 0.301–0.483 million, 23%) and diarrhea (0.208 million, UR 0.179–0.274 million, 12%) accounted for another third (3). For pneumonia and diarrhea, the 5 countries with the most deaths include India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ethiopia (28). Although challenges and inequities remain (29), there has been progress. Of the 2 million fewer deaths seen between 2000 and 2010, 41% of the lives saved were related to diarrhea and pneumonia. Pneumonia deaths fell from 1.846 (UR 1.608–2.124 million) to 1.393 million (UR 1.185–1.639 million), with the pneumonia-specific mortality rate dropping by an average of 3.1% (UR 2.6%–3.4%) per year. Diarrhea deaths fell from 1.160 (UR 0.911–1.574 million) to 0.798 million (UR 0.550–1.176 million), a 4.0% (UR 2.5%–5.6%) decline; however, the present rate of reduction of these deaths is insufficient to attain Millennium Development Goal 4. Despite reduced mortality, there is evidence that morbidity rates have hardly reduced during the last 2 decades (30), reflecting relatively sparse attention paid to preventive strategies and social determinants of health. Child undernutrition trends show some improvement, but unequal progress (31) and rates of reduction in stunting in Africa and parts of south Asia remain extremely slow. There is considerable overlap between interventions to prevent and treat childhood diarrhea and pneumonia. Most of these interventions are inexpensive and well established, such as exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months, access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, oral rehydration therapy, zinc supplementation, and community case management, yet their global coverage remains low, with huge differentials between various socioeconomic groups (29). Preventive interventions, some of which reduce the incidence of both diseases, include optimal breast-feeding practices and adequate nutrition, immunizations, hand washing with soap, and access to improved water and sanitation facilities. Lifesaving treatment options after a child becomes sick include antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia and oral rehydration salts and zinc for diarrhea; however, coverage of these interventions remains low, particularly among the most vulnerable children. In addition, many interventions requiring modifications of care seeking and household behaviors also do not have effective coverage, and if anything, overall coverage rates of oral rehydration for diarrhea have stagnated for the last decade. In a previous estimation of costs for scaling up interventions for child survival, we assessed costs according to service delivery modes (community-based services, outreach programs, and facility-based clinical services) and suggested that a modest global investment of US$5.1 billion (UR US$3.1–8 billion) in new resources was needed annually to save 6 million child lives in the 42 countries responsible for 90% of child deaths in 2000 (32). These figures have been revised since to include a range of costs for integrated packages of maternal, newborn, and child health and include costs of training sufficient human resources, developing management capacity, and other aspects of the health system needed to scale up and sustain these coverage levels. A major cost-effective strategy for this is the development of cadr","Received August 30, 201 From the Massachusett University, Karachi, P ment, Harvard Unive Laboratory, Juntendo Japan, the jjDivision Witwatersrand, Johan Economics and Poli Pediatrics, School of M and the Instituto d Universidad de Chile, Address correspondence Massachusetts Gener Boston, MA 02114 (e The authors report no co Copyright # 2012 by E Hepatology, and Nut Gastroenterology, He DOI: 10.1097/MPG.0b01",H.

Raffelhüschen and Jasmin Häcker point out that by now it is common knowledge that the German Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) is in urgent need of a broad reform. Without any doubt, two fundamental mistakes have been made from the scretch: First, it was constructed as a pay-asyou- go scheme, despite of the demographic turbulence ahead. Secondly, contributions were drawn from the payroll although the risk of long-term care is definitely not correlated with personal income. Hence, it is essential to revise both mistakes and to bring about a new and sustainable insurance scheme. In their paper they suggest a reasonable transition from the current pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded strategy thereby accounting for the burden each generation is confronted with. With the help of generational accounting they demonstrate that the so called “Auslaufmodell” achieves a certain intergenerational balance. It is, however, crucial that the reform takes place instantly, otherwise it will never. This is due to the fact that only in the very near future people can not argue that they have paid their dues. Winfried Schmähl and Heinz Rothgang discuss the consequences of a judgement of Germany′s Constitutional Court. In April 2004 it decided that the Social Long-term Care Insurance discriminates families as compared to those without children since the former also contribute to the system by raising children while the latter do not. The court thus asks for an internalisation of the externalities resulting from child raising, i.e. future contributions of the children. Until 2004 the legislator has to reform the financing system respectively. In this article several options to do so are discussed. With respect to five normative criteria the authors conclude that a reduction of contributions for families is inferior to a fixed cash transfer per child financed by a special tax. Gisela Färber points out that reforming Germany′s system of Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) is necessary for two major reasons: Since 1999, spendings in this pillar of Social Insurance in Germany exceed contributions; in 2003 deficits added up to 700 Million Euro. Demographic changes will even increase the funding gap. Furthermore, Germany′s Constitutional Court decided that families are discriminated in the existing pay-as-you-go system, a disadvantage which has to be corrected before end of 2004. The author criticises the Court’s argumentation from an economic point of view. She argues that the problem of LCI is not the lack of children but the increase of life expectancy with each year of birth. She therefore proposes to add elements of capital funding within or besides the existing system which helps to overcome the increasing costs. A total abolition of the pay-as-you-use principle however would restrict (limited, but necessary) spaces of redistribution within the LTCI. Furthermore, adult family members of employees should not get free insurance coverage anymore, but pay at least a minimum rate of contribution themselves. Then contributions for family members during a certain period of education might be subsidised by tax revenue.","Abstract In their contribution Bernd Raffelhüschen and Jasmin Häcker point out that by now it is common knowledge that the German Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) is in urgent need of a broad reform.

First, we ascertain the degree to which intergenerational wage mobility can be measured using available survey data. Second, using a simple regression based approach, we determine the extent to which wages are persistent on the part of sons and daughters relative to fathers’ wage outcomes. Third, we highlight the role of parental education and measure how the labor market rewards or penalizes labor market participants. Fourth, we examine the statistical importance of parental educational achievements relative to their children using the ordered probability model. The paper finds wage persistence. Transition probabilities show that persistence is observed at the lowest and highest quintiles of the wage distribution. The transition probabilities show that persistence is not uniformly observed throughout the reference distribution. Returns to education among the well-educated sons and daughters remain high, and parental education continues to determine the relative magnitudes of wage gains and penalties. Children of highly educated fathers expectedly reap wage gains while those whose fathers have finished no more than high school education suffer from wage penalties. Parental education profiles determine a child’s educational achievements. Results indicate that children with college educated parents tend to graduate from college with high likelihood of success. In terms of resources, nonlabor income will only boost the probability of being a college graduate, with the rest of the education outcomes registering negative effects.

Rates of late or no marriage as well as divorce are going up birth rates have plummeted to below replacement. Intergenerational continuity and care of both young and elderly are seriously compromised. Repercussions on society are worrisome and take the form of absolute decline in labor force and national populations, rapid ageing of the population and increasing dependency ratios that threaten national social welfare systems. As a response to these national calamities, householding is going global. Spouses are being searched for abroad. Children, with their mothers, arc sent overseas for education, leaving fathers behind to work to finance them. Hundreds of thousands of foreign domestic helpers and caretakers of children and the elderly are being recruited for daily reproduction of households. In the absence of support from their progeny, seniors are retiring abroad as a way of subsisting on fixed incomes. Variations in global householding are pronounced among the three societies, revealing how local contexts matter in a global age. Yet the similarities in responses are even greater. Together all of the elements of global householding present a fundamentally new moment in East Asia history that challenges ideas of citizenship and social homogeneity that have long been associated with the nation-state in this world region. They also potentially offer amelioration to social crises emanating from the current demographic transition embedded in declining capacities of local households in social reproduction.",,,false,,false,,

Americans live in unhealthy neighborhoods that are marked by limited job opportunities, low-quality housing, pollution, limited access to healthy food, and few opportunities for physical activity, and that nearly half of black children live in particularly unhealthy areas of concentrated poverty.1

Housing mobility programs provide vulnerable populations—including families with children—with resources to escape neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage and move to neighborhoods of socioeconomic opportunity. These programs have the potential to improve population health and reduce health disparities by increasing access to health-promoting neighborhood amenities (e.g. grocery stores, safe recreational spaces, higher quality housing units), reducing exposure to chronic stressors (e.g. violence and crime), altering social networks, and achieving intergenerational increases in socioeconomic status and educational attainment. Prompted in large part by findings from the Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration (“MTO”), policy makers have begun to ask how to most effectively leverage the nation’s housing programs to maximize health. Increasingly, attention has focused on using housing mobility to target young children.

MTO, a randomized controlled trial conducted in the 1990’s, tested whether the offer of counseling, together with a housing voucher that could only be used in a low poverty census tract for the first year of its use, would lead to better outcomes, compared to a traditional housing voucher or remaining in public housing. In practice, the MTO counseling families received was modest, post-move counseling was not provided when families moved a second time (which was a common occurrence), and administrative barriers made it difficult to afford higher rents in opportunity suburbs. As a result, many of families who received a MTO voucher to move to a low poverty area did not relocate and, even among those who did, many returned to high poverty neighborhoods after a short period of time. Despite this, MTO demonstrated that the offer of a voucher to move to a low poverty neighborhood led to improved health outcomes including obesity, diabetes, and rates of physical exercise.2 Recently, Kessler and colleagues found that girls from families who were offered a voucher to move to a low poverty neighborhood had, as adolescents, lower rates of depression and conduct disorders but boys had higher rates of depression, PTSD, and conduct disorders.3 The reasons for these counterintuitive findings for boys are the subject of on-going debate.

The MTO results underscore the challenges of using housing vouchers to move to, and then to stay in, neighborhoods of opportunity. The need for housing assistance far exceeds the available resources at the local, state, and national levels in the U.S. The Housing Choice Voucher program is the federal government’s largest rental assistance program. It helps 2.2 million of the nation’s poorest and most vulnerable households afford decent housing in the private market, at an annual cost of about $19 billion.4 The program is an important federal investment designed to reduce worst case housing needs (i.e., the number of households living in substandard housing or experiencing financial hardship by paying more than half their income for housing costs) among very low income households.

Housing Choice Vouchers have been criticized for failing to expand access to quality housing for low income families in neighborhoods where jobs, transportation and high quality educational opportunities are greatest. Despite the buying power that the voucher provides, nearly half of the families using vouchers live in high poverty neighborhoods,5 and their children rarely have access to high quality educational opportunities.6 Black voucher participants have even greater difficulty translating this buying power into improved neighborhoods.7

MTO employed a powerful research design, but its health findings offer promise precisely because the “treatment” was a short lived and relatively weak intervention as compared to today’s mobility counseling programs. Today’s programs provide families with stronger supports for longer periods of time to overcome barriers to using vouchers in opportunity neighborhoods. The two largest mobility programs that are now operating, in Dallas and Baltimore, resulted from litigation settlements. In Baltimore, where disparities in life expectancy can vary by as much as 20 years depending on where one lives, over 2,400 families have chosen to move into racially integrated, lower poverty neighborhoods. With on-going post-move assistance, families typically stay in these new neighborhoods, or those that are similar, for many years. Across the nation, however, federal funding for housing mobility programs has been scarce and sporadic. Currently HUD funding for Housing Choice Vouchers covers the cost of the voucher but not the accompanying mobility counseling services that enable minority families to use the voucher to access higher opportunity neighborhoods.

Several key gaps must be filled to build support for mobility counseling to be combined with housing vouchers as a health promoting intervention. First, policy makers have suggested that the potential costs of operating mobility programs maybe offset by changes in health care spending over time. Currently, HUD and local housing agencies have little incentive to bear the costs of mobility programs on their budgets if the ‘savings’ accrue to health agencies. Rigorously quantifying the potential cost savings of housing mobility is an important step in better aligning health and housing policy goals and building an evidence base for these agencies to jointly pay for mobility counseling as a potential health and wellness intervention.

Second, the optimal way to target mobility programs to obtain the biggest health return on investment remains largely unknown. The agency that oversees Baltimore’s mobility program has recently adopted an early childhood preference, targeting housing vouchers and counseling services to eligible low income families with young children (0 to 8 years old) living in Baltimore City’s poorest neighborhoods. Their reasons are explicitly health-related—evidence suggests that exposure to neighborhoods characterized by violence have a detrimental impact on brain development and long term health outcomes. Measuring health benefits and cost savings that accrue when a family with children moves to better housing in a safer and healthier neighborhood is critical. Additional research is necessary to determine whether mobility counseling might result in health benefits and cost savings for other vulnerable populations, such as those with preexisting diabetes and obesity.

At the same time, potential disruptions in health care may be especially salient for patients with preexisting health conditions if families move further away from their doctors or clinics. It is possible that providing counseling about health care resources in new neighborhoods may factor into families’ decisions to move to specific homes and help ease their transition.

Finally, clinicians, health care systems, and insurers may play an important role in not only identifying individuals and families who may benefit from a referral to a housing mobility program but also supporting their health as they move. Health care reforms that promote population health management, such as accountable care organizations, may provide an impetus for collaboration with and financial support of mobility programs.

Evidence demonstrates that poor families living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods are exposed to significant health risks. Such evidence also suggests that durable investments in housing programs that help low-income families find and afford housing in high-opportunity neighborhoods can improve health. Quantifying the potential health care savings is critical for aligning incentives and increasing funds to extend the mobility’s reach.","In its recent call to action, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Commission to Build a Healthier America noted that nearly a fifth of all Americans live in unhealthy neighborhoods that are marked by limited job opportunities, low-quality housing, pollution, limited access to healthy food, and few opportunities for physical activity, and that nearly half of black children live in particularly unhealthy areas of concentrated poverty.1

impact on all areas of public life in the 21st century. The influence of the population aging process on various areas of social activity will be determined by its scale and depth, i.e. by the potential demographic structure of the future society. At the same time, the ability of modern society to cope with elevated risks associated with this process is a problematic matter. The risks and problems associated with population aging include economic recessions, pension crises, the issue of caring for the increasingly more numerous disabled and frail people, maintaining the financial savings of the elderly, the issue of ageism, and the vulnerability of the elderly during periods of crisis and pandemics, and consequently maintaining life expectancy as well as stable democracy and even world order. These risks and problems are of particular concern given that by the mid-21st century two thirds of people over the age of 65 will be living in medium and low income countries. Moreover, aging will affect even today’s poorest countries that are located in Sub-Saharan Africa with their populations that are still young as of today. In view of this, the problem of social security and healthcare for the elderly is becoming increasingly acute and requires implementing proactive measures. The problem of population aging does not get enough attention from such international organizations as the UN and WHO; in general, studies on this issue both in the public realm and in scientific discourse are limited. However, even now global aging is an extremely important problem, and we assume that it will become the most crucial problem in the future. Thus, not paying sufficient attention to it might lead to negative consequences such as societal tensions, crises and intergenerational conflicts, as well as political and social instability. In this article we approach the process from the perspective of transitioning from perceiving it as a problem to considering it as something that provides new opportunities associated with the more mature and older generation possessing worldly wisdom and experience. Today specific measures must be taken in different areas, and special long-term programs must be adopted to promote a higher health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for the older generation, as well as to combat the widespread stereotype of feeling doomed at an old age, the idea being that your life is over. Grinin et al. point out the importance of technologies, the development of which can be stimulated specifically by the process of global aging and the need to increase life expectancy. As a background for the forthcoming technological wave (which we refer to as the Cybernetic Revolution), global aging may create an acute demand for labor-conservation technologies, as well as provide a powerful stimulus for the field of medicine. Progress in the latter realm would help prolong working age and improve health-related (biological) quality of life.","This article analyzes the process of global population aging, which has a significant impact on all areas of public life in the 21st century.

occupational choice by using register‐based individual panel data for the period 2003 to 2006. Individuals choose to move into self‐employment out of three possible initial statuses: paid employment, combiner or inactivity. These groups are of specific interest for the Swedish political agenda. The question that we specifically pose is how a set of socio‐economic factors separately induce men and women in these three statuses to enter self‐employment.

These new entrepreneurs share certain characteristics that make them choose employment in small firms in the first place. 5. See Rees and Shah (1986 Rees, H. and Shah, A. 1986.

[Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). 8. The time subscript is suppressed hereafter. 9. Incomes in our study cannot be adjusted for working hours. We assume though that individuals are aware of the long working hours that self‐employment may lead to and that it may be the total income from each status that plays the decisive role for switching. 10. Although the choice of these limits is made on an ad hoc basis, further sensitivity analysis of our estimations do not show any dramatic changes. 11. For a similar definition of combiners see Folta, Delmar, and Wennberg (2009 Folta, T.B., Delmar, F. and Wennberg, K. 2009. Hybrid entrepreneurship. Management Science, [Google Scholar]). 12. The reduced form multinomial logit models estimated in the first stage contain all variables. Variables that are thought to affect the status choice but not earnings are excluded from the earnings equations for identification reasons. Capital income variables, intergenerational relations, firm‐size, start‐up subsidies for inactive, days in inactivity, inactive groups and the combiner distinction are thus excluded. Results on transition into wage‐employment, combiner status or inactivity are available upon request. 13. The results are expressed in log‐odds units. The reason for not choosing marginal effects is that they depend on where the independent variables are being evaluated (at the mean, quantiles or other points in the distribution). This in turn may lead to a change in sign for the parameter estimates, which makes them difficult to interpret. 14. Although we do not present a detailed discussion on these results, they are available upon request. 15. A formal test does not, however, support a significant difference between men and women. Performing such a test, which compares coefficients between men and women in binary choice models is not a trivial exercise (see Allison 1999 Allison, P. 1999. Comparing logit and probit coefficients across groups. Sociological Methods and Research, 28: 186–208. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). The outcome of applying it is available upon request. 16. We have no evidence in our data whether the respondents' partners work in the same business. 17. If, for some reason, unemployment is caused as a result of structural transformations, these workers might still be very productive. 18. As discussed in de Wit and van Winden (1989 de Wit, G. and van Winden, F.A.A.M. 1989. An empirical analysis of self‐employment in the Netherlands. Small Business Economics, 1: 263–72. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), the inclusion of industry as an explanatory factor implies that the entry decision is made after the selection of industry. Our data show, however, that about 70% of employees and combiners enter self‐employment within the same industry. 19. Although the level of education among self‐employed is lower compared with employees (Table A2), the entry rate of highly educated employees into self‐employment is higher.","The objective of this paper is to empirically examine the determinants of the self‐employment decision, with a particular focus on gender differences and occupational choice by using register‐based individual panel data for the period 2003 to 2006.

neglected the exponential spike in private wealth and plutonomic tendencies in the post-reform period. This article maps the political economy of the staggering rise and growth of superrich in India. It traces the roots of the state-capital relationship in the colonial period and provides the main contrast between the political economy of the pre-reform and post-reform periods. It does so by analyzing key variables that have facilitated, or continue to facilitate, the flow of private wealth in India. It also examines three major drivers of superrich wealth in India–rent-seeking, entrepreneurship, and inheritance. The article makes two arguments. Firstly, the state's dramatic turn in support of private capital/wealth accumulation began quite earlier but assumed formal and dynamic forms only after the implementation of economic reforms in 1991. Secondly, the rise of India's superrich has not simply been a function of merit and entrepreneurial skills as is popularly believed. It is a peculiar combination of other factors that are leading to enormous resources and capacity concentrated in the hands of the superrich and their ability to exert considerable influence on India's domestic and global policies. Above all, the indispensability of the state's support has been one of the key factors explaining why some people become and continue to grow rich in India.

It is important to note that the proximate terms such as plutocrats, affluent, and elite used in this article are taken in the same parlance as the superrich or billionaires, unless indicated otherwise. For a detailed discussion on the usage of the term, see Sin Yee Koh, Bart Wissink and Ray Forrest, ""Reconsidering the super-rich: variations, structural conditions and urban consequences,"" in Handbook on Wealth and the Superrich, ed. Iain Hay and Jonathan V. Beaverstock, (UK: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2016), 20–22.2 While research on superrich has lately made inroads into mainstream political and economic studies, it has steadily grown as an interdisciplinary research area over the last decade. There is a visible shift in major disciplines notably in international relations and international political economy in terms of growing attention toward the global superrich. Hagel (2021) has probably, for the first time, presented billionaires as distinct and important actors in world politics. Focus on the superrich varies with context and spheres. Page, Seawright and Lacombe (2019) highlight the role of billionaires in the US politics, with a spotlight on their lesser visible or covert forms of interventions in elections and economic policies. Similarly Collins (2021) focuses on hitherto unknown routes through which billionaires funnel their wealth and preserve it from the tax authorities. See Iain Hay, Jonathan V. Beaverstock, ""They've 'never had it so good:' the rise and rise of the super-rich,"" ed. Iain Hay and Jonathan V.

For all estimations and figures pertaining to India's superrich, this study has relied on this archived data (unless suggested otherwise) that is accessible at: https://stats.areppim.com/stats/links_billionairexlists.htm.7 Forbes' approach for estimating the superrich wealth involves a unique methodology that includes an estimation of a broader range of assets, including cars, jewelry, yachts, planes, ranches, houses, stocks in private and public companies and other luxury items. The major limitation of Forbes data is that that it only captures the stated or declared wealth of the superrich; hence undeclared assets remain beyond the purview of these estimations. See Jennifer Wang, ""Forbes 400 Methodology: How We Crunch the Numbers,"" Forbes, October 2, 2019.https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2019/10/02/forbes-400-methodology-how-we-crunch-the-numbers/?sh=798aef2f1715.8 Although the term plutonomy has relatively recent origins, the economic condition dates back to the Sixteenth century. It entered the popular lexicon in 2005 with the publication of a Citigroup report. It defined plutonomy as economies, or tendency in economies, where ""economic growth is powered and largely consumed by the wealthy few."" This article seeks to make the case that the Indian economy exhibits some generic plutonomic characteristics, especially if the share of superrich wealth and their ability to influence policy decisions are taken into account. For original discussion on plutonomy thesis, see Kapoor, Ajay, Macleod, Niall, Singh, Narendra, Equity Strategy: Plutonomy: Buying Luxury, Explaining Global Imbalances, (New York: Citigroup Research, 2005), 1, https://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-1.pdf.9 Manmohan Singh, ""Budget 1991–92 Speech of Shri Manmohan Singh: Part A"" (New Delhi: Ministry of Finance, Government of India, July 24, 1991), 3, 8, accessed on 12 April 2019.https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/bspeech/bs199192.pdf.10 Quoted in Moneycontrol.

The role of ""Protestant Ethic"" in material transformation in the West is an excellent example. The cultural and religious depictions of the rich certainly influenced the perception of wealth in India. It is this collective perception of society that Deepak Lal calls ""cosmological beliefs.""

Raghuram Rajan (2008) calls it ""Oligarchic Capitalism"" for the reason that the superrich now dominate India's capitalist story apart from being one of the most unequal economies in the world. See Raghuram Rajan, ""Is there a threat of Oligarchy in India,"" University of Chicago, September 10, 2008. https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/raghuram.rajan/research/papers/Is%20there%20a%20threat%20of%20oligarchy%20in%20India.pdf. James Crabtree (2018) uses the term ""Billionaire Raj"" to emphasize upon the incredible presence of the billionaires in an otherwise poor country. See Crabtree, The Billionaire Raj, xxiii-xxiv. Chancel and Piketty (2019) also use term ""Billionaire Raj"" but largely to demonstrate increasing concentration of income to a tiny section of the population––an unprecedented phenomenon in India since the ""British Raj."" See Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, ""Indian Income Inequality, 1922–1915: From British Raj to Billionaire Raj,"" Review of Income and Wealth 65, (2019): 54–58. https://doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12439.29 Many scholars have made this argument, but more elaborately by Baldev Raj Nayyar.

See Rudolph and Rudolph, Lakshmi, 1–7.39 Chrystia Freeland, Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Superrich and the Fall of Everyone Else, (London: Penguin Books, 2012), xiv. In terms of implications, it is hard to anticipate that the superrich, being so powerful, would help produce neutral policies and rules. This is described as the ""bipartisan blind spot"" of capitalist economies. See Brink Lindsey, Steven M. Teles, The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth and Increase Inequality, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2017), 8.40 See Rahul Mukherjee, Political Economy of Reforms in India, (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2014), 11.41 Kohli, Poverty Amid Plenty, 3.42 Deepak Nayyar, ""Economic Liberalization in India: Then and Now,"" Economic and Political Weekly 52, no.2 (2017): 41–48. https://www.epw.in/journal/2017/2/25-years-economic-liberalisation/economic-liberalisation-india.html.43 Varshney's argument is relevant even today. The farmer resistance to the recent farm laws forced the government to revoke the legislations. It implies that the economic reforms that concern the masses in a democracy are unlikely to succeed.

For a detailed account of structural conditions, see Koh, Wissink and Forrest, Structural Conditions, 22–23.48 Scholars have described a combination of pathways through which the power of the business groups operate. The former involves direct use of power such as financing elections to seek favorable policies, lobby government, assume political positions directly. The latter includes more opaque ways in which business groups occupy major economic levers that politicians cannot but take care of their interests.

As per these estimates, the cumulative superrich wealth in India was $ 28.03 billion in 2000; $ 222.1 billion in 2010; and $517.02 billion in 2020. In 2022, the net superrich wealth accounted for 24.72 percent of India's GDP.73 The data on India's GDP is taken from the World Bank data ""GDP (current US$) – India,"" available at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=IN.74 New World Wealth, Global Wealth Migration Review (Mauritius: AfrAsia Bank, 2018), 8. https://www.afrasiabank.com/media/2915/gwmr-2018.pdf.75 Aditi Gandhi, Michael Walton, ""Where Do India's Billionaires Get their Wealth,"" Economic and Political Weekly 47, no. 40 (2012): 10–14, https://www.jstor.org/stable/41720206.76 Gandhi and Walton, ""India's Billionaires,"" 13.77 Ibid., 12.78 See Sutirtha Bagchi, Jan Svejnar ""Does Wealth Distribution and Sources of Wealth Matter for Economic Growth?

See Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Subhir Ghosh, Jyotirmoy Chaudhuri, Gas Wars: Crony Capitalism and the Ambanis, (New Delhi: Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, 2014). Chapter 10. The publication of this work was soon followed by defamation suit filed by Reliance. The matter is still sub judice. More recently, Adani slapped a similar defamation suit against the news portal The Wire which had earlier published article indicating the role of government in easing rules pertaining to Special Economic Zone so as to help Adani Power Limited. The process of filing defamation lawsuits by superrich has become a regular tactic aimed to undermine research on crony practices.82 See Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Union Civil Compliance: Report Number 11 of 2016, 02 August, 2016, 103–115.https://cag.gov.in/cag_old/sites/default/files/audit_report_files/Union_Civil_Compliance_Report_11_of_2016.pdf.83 For a similar kind of argument, see Arye L.

This article maps the political economy of the staggering rise and growth of superrich in India. It traces the roots of the state-capital relationship in the colonial period and provides the main contrast between the political economy of the pre-reform and post-reform periods. It does so by analyzing key variables that have facilitated, or continue to facilitate, the flow of private wealth in India. It also examines three major drivers of superrich wealth in India–rent-seeking, entrepreneurship, and inheritance. The article makes two arguments. Firstly, the state’s dramatic turn in support of private capital/wealth accumulation began quite earlier but assumed formal and dynamic forms only after the implementation of economic reforms in 1991. Secondly, the rise of India’s superrich has not simply been a function of merit and entrepreneurial skills as is popularly believed. It is a peculiar combination of other factors that are leading to enormous resources and capacity concentrated in the hands of the superrich and their ability to exert considerable influence on India’s domestic and global policies. Above all, the indispensability of the state’s support has been one of the key factors explaining why some people become and continue to grow rich in India.",A. A. Wani,false,false,false,false,

It is well known that the new Meiji government endevored to dissolve the discrimination based on feudal estate system and more than ninety percent of the total population was made to be equal, social as well as legally, although not economically, within a relatively short time. However, our nation-wide sample survey of 1965, which offers us for the first time after 1904 figures concerning to population distribution of Samurai descendants and commoners, revealed that substantial difference between Samurai descendants and commoners still exists. The proportion of Samurai descendants occupying the higher position in occupation, education, and income is larger than that of commoners, although the differences are smaller in the present generation than in the preceding ones. Why does social superiority, although not outstanding, of Samurai descendants still exist after one handred years since legal discrimination was abolished ?

Our sample survey conducted in 1964 in Tokyo revealed percentages of mobility-oriented responses to various kinds of attitude questions and scales by the distinction of Samurai descendants and commoners, taking account of the influence from present occupation.

measure of societal progress is that our children will be better off than their parents, building a thriving, more equitable and sustainable Australia for future generations. Today, it seems we are failing in this basic measure of societal achievement. Despite many gains, such as increased immunisation rates1 and educational attainment,2 inequities have increased steadily in Australia over the past two decades3, 4 and children and young people are faring poorly across core metrics. For example, one in six children live in poverty,5 one in four experience overweight or obesity,6 three in five adults report experiencing some form of child maltreatment,7 one in two adolescents are very or extremely worried about climate change,8 and one in seven children and adolescents have a mental disorder.9 For children and young people in priority populations (eg, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin or low income households), health and wellbeing outcomes are often far worse.10 As a wealthy nation, we have the tools to redirect the current trajectory for children and young people and ensure we create a thriving, sustainable and equitable society. However, turning this around will require considerable societal focus, political will and policy effort. Measuring what matters to children and young people needs to be placed at the heart of policy decision making, with government commitment to regular reporting and with clear accountability mechanisms. This inaugural MJA supplement proposes a path forward for Australia to create policy environments that centre on the health and wellbeing of our children and young people and future generations. This requires systemic policy change. It means thinking about upstream root causes, such as the social determinants of health (eg, commercial, structural, political and economic determinants), prevention, and pre-distribution of spending (rather than redistribution), and should involve young people and children's voices in decision making.11, 12 This necessitates an economy that works for the people and the planet13 — where children's and young people's health and wellbeing are considered the real and measurable profit to the current and future economy. Like many high income countries, decades of an economy focused on growth at all costs, rather than sustainable and equitable growth, has threatened the health and wellbeing of children and young people and future generations.14, 15 It has also contributed to a culmination of “wicked problems” — those complex social and cultural problems that are interconnected and difficult to solve. Examples of such problems include the climate emergency, obesity, gross inequities and a mental health crisis, all of which disproportionately affect our children and young people, particularly those in priority groups.3, 10 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shone a light on Australia's inequities,16 with children and young people faring poorly and emerging as a strong policy interest.17 It is now critical to maintain this interest and consider how best to manage these complex issues with a sense of urgency. Australia also has many strengths (eg, high quality existing service and prevention systems), making it poised to turn things around, particularly through policy environments. Policies for children and young people often focus on their closest environments — family, school and community — and these are key to ensuring children can thrive. But the effects of policies within a wider circle of environmental influences — workplaces, societal, economic, political and cultural — also have an impact on their lives (Box 1).18, 19 As outlined by Stanley and colleagues19 almost two decades ago, these influences are outside the control of families and schools, yet they can enable or disable healthy futures by creating a civil or uncivil society (Box 1). A key example has been our failure to prioritise preventive health spending, which comprised a mere 2% of health expenditure in 2019 and saw Australia rank 30 out of 40 on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) league table of countries.20 Source: reproduced with permission from Stanley et al.19 The Countdown will report on the most important health and wellbeing outcomes for children and young Australians — those where change could make a real difference in their lives by 2030, laying down the stepping stones for a better future. We will track progress towards these outcomes as a way of holding us all, particularly policy makers and governments at all levels, to account on these metrics. We plan to do this every year through publication in the MJA and through our collective voice and advocacy, pushing us all to go beyond the rhetoric. Australia has invested substantially in measuring and tracking the health and wellbeing of children and young people. For example, over 13 outstanding Australian child and young people wellbeing frameworks already exist, such as the Australian Children's Wellbeing Index, UNICEF/Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY),10 and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Children's Headline Indicators.21 These frameworks measure outcomes across a wide range of domains that reflect key health, social, cultural and environmental aspects of young Australian lives. They have been important for spotlighting children and young people's health and wellbeing, with some gathering sporadic political traction. However, it has been challenging to get buy-in from policy makers, financial investment and the general public. A major reason for this has been a lack of national coordination of children's policy and the fact that children's and young people's health and wellbeing are not a national priority. Policy developments in recent years have begun to emphasise the health, wellbeing and development of children and young people. The federal government has made a commitment to “leaving no-one behind” through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,22 the National Children's Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy,23 the Early Years Strategy,24 Measuring What Matters as part of Australia's First Wellbeing Framework,25 Australia's Youth Policy Framework26 and Youth Advisory Groups established by the Office for Youth.27 The Uluru Statement from the Heart28 provides a clear agenda for health and other policies that would help deal with the ongoing intergenerational effects of colonisation that continue to affect children's and young people's health, education and social wellbeing.29, 30 When Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are empowered to make decisions about their community's health and wellbeing, this can have a profound impact.31 A constructive national dialogue and a new path must be forged to help ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices are heard and that we close the gap. Similarly, the national Measuring What Matters Wellbeing Framework25 represents a major step in the right direction and includes some key child- and youth-centred measures, with a special focus on the early years. However, in its current form it does not provide any mechanism for government accountability. The Countdown will complement the government framework and contribute clear accountability measures tailored to improve policy and funding to achieve better outcomes for children and young people. National action plans or strategies, frameworks, taskforces, seminal reports and well intended policies will ultimately fail unless they are implemented through systemic policy change and a long term vision to bring about equity and intergenerational advancement.32 Policy making is highly dependent on how Australia's short policy and political cycles can respond to significant policy and societal challenges. This requires advocacy, expert knowledge and public awareness to be harnessed to achieve political will and commitment along with legislative initiative, bipartisan support and a national commitment to monitoring, evaluation and reporting. Only with a committed longer term lens can we avoid the collapse of well intended polices at the end of each political cycle. These issues are by no means isolated to Australia. Other countries have begun to address them systematically and we can learn from these examples. The Nordic countries have done this well for decades, with policies aimed at creating fair societies.33 Subsequently, the Nordic countries have some of the lowest rates of children living in poverty compared with other OECD countries.34 More recently, Wales implemented a novel legislative mechanism where intergenerational impacts form part of budgeting and policy decisions.35 Meanwhile, other Wellbeing Economy Governments, such as New Zealand and Scotland, have committed to using child wellbeing measures as part of budgeting reporting and recognising intergenerational effects.36-38 European countries have also recently agreed to a “child guarantee” to prevent and combat social exclusion by guaranteeing effective access of children in need to a set of key services (eg, free early childhood education and care, free health care, and adequate housing).39 What all of these examples include is clear government accountability for the health and wellbeing of children and young people and, in some cases, future generations (ie, the Future Generations Commissioner in Wales). In Australia, we currently lack coordination and accountability for children's and young people's policy, with it being widely dispersed across portfolios and jurisdictions. The Countdown aims to build on and draw attention to existing work. Within Australia, there has already been tremendous progress to understand what matters to children and young people. From our review of the peer reviewed and grey literature, together with our networks, we identified existing frameworks that reflect the breadth of national and state and territory efforts in articulating priority outcome areas for children and/or young people. Specifically, we were interested in current frameworks that comprise multiple domains of child or youth wellbeing, or that establish multiple priority areas for policy. We also sought to include an international perspective for comparison. This led to mapping 16 highly regarded established frameworks that measure the health, wellbeing and development of children and young people, comprising seven national10, 21, 23, 26, 40-42 and six state-based Australian frameworks43-48 and three major international frameworks.49-51 We then conducted a literature review to examine their developmental age span, number of domains, outcomes and indicator measures, reporting period, accountability mechanisms, and if they were developed with input from children and young people. A high level summary of the literature review is presented in Box 2. Each framework is also detailed in the Supporting Information, appendix A, and a full list of framework domains and indicator measures is included in the Supporting Information, appendix B. The quality, expertise and evidence base of each framework were considered, with each providing key elements relevant to our purpose. Particular issues identified in the literature review that are central to our aims for the Countdown are outlined below. ACT = Australian Capital Territory; AIHW = Australian Institute of Health and Welfare; ARACY = Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth; CCYP = Commissioner for Children and Young People; na = not applicable; OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; UNICEF = United Nations Children's Fund. * Six priority areas. The colours indicate whether the framework includes the reviewed element: green = yes; dark orange = no; light orange = unclear. First, age coverage was often separated between child or adolescent frameworks, with just over half of the frameworks covering the full developmental age span from birth to young adulthood. Investments targeted at early childhood development (age 0–8 years) have been long understood to improve outcomes later in life.52 Similarly, investment in adolescents and young adults (age 10–24 years) is critical and yields a triple dividend of benefits.53 As the late Professor George Patton so perfectly articulated, by investing in this age group “you change not only the present lives of young people, but also their future adult health trajectories and the welfare of the children their generation will go on to parent”.54 Many frameworks, policies and services take a child legislative approach up to the age of 18 years only. But young adulthood is a major transition period incorporating change, exploration and risk taking55 and where mental disorders can emerge or compound.56 Thus, any attempt to measure what matters to children and young people must consider the full developmental spectrum from ages 0 to 24 years.57 Second, only half of the frameworks were developed with the involvement of young people. Children and young people are experts in their own lives;58 they can offer rich, contemporary perspectives on their own experiences, wellbeing and worries, as well as unique solutions.59 This also matters from a rights perspective, where, under Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, children have a right to be heard, to have their views respected and to have a say on issues concerning them, particularly where adults are making decisions that affect them.60 Tasmania's Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy43 provides an example of how children and young people's voices can shape policy priorities and investments, and the Victorian Department of Education's Amplify toolkit illustrates how student voices can have positive impacts on school culture and student outcomes.61, 62 Third, the review revealed that the six domains (valued, loved and safe; material basics; healthy; learning; participating; and positive sense of identity and culture) that form the Nest,42 a wellbeing framework developed by ARACY in 2012, were commonly used across the frameworks. These domains have been adopted by UNICEF in the Australian Children's Wellbeing Index,10 by the Tasmanian Government in their Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy,43 and the Northern Territory Government in their Story of our Children and Young People.48 The constructs are also closely mirrored by the six domains of the New Zealand Government's 2019 Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy.49 It is unsurprising that the Nest framework has been adopted widely, given that it was developed considering the voices of more than 4000 children, families and experts.63 A comprehensive refresh of the Nest, incorporating a new generation of child and youth voices, is anticipated in 2024. Fourth, the volume of indicators used in the frameworks ranged from 16 to over 100, with most focusing on measuring deficits rather than taking a strengths-based approach. Ignoring positive outcomes puts us at risk of not understanding the complete picture of what shapes health and wellbeing at the population level.64 Recognising the social, psychological and environmental influences that facilitate positive health and wellbeing has been shown to have a comparable impact on health as a focus on risk factors.64 Thus, considering both positive and negative outcomes is required if we are to nurture the health, development and wellbeing of all children and young people. Finally, we examined accountability mechanisms and the frequency with which frameworks are able to report on progress towards outcomes. Framework reports varied greatly, with very few indicators being measured annually, biennially or triennially, and often data were only collected every five to 14 years (eg, in the Census and the Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing).65 This makes tracking progress extremely challenging and does not enable or promote accountability for progress. The ARACY Nest Framework42 is most aligned with our aims for the Countdown's framework. The key elements informing this decision were its holistic nature, its coverage of the full age spectrum of children and young people (0–24 years) and that it was developed with the participation of children and young people. The Framework has now been presented in three report cards by ARACY and twice by the Australian Children's Wellbeing Index (UNICEF/ARACY), with the latter's most recent release in March 2023.10 This Index is an obvious starting point for the Future Healthy Countdown 2030. However, an additional domain that is increasingly significant for the future health and wellbeing of children and young people is the environment and sustainability.66 Accordingly, the Future Healthy Countdown comprises the six domains of the Nest framework, with the seventh domain “Environments and sustainable futures” (Box 3). The Countdown will be a vehicle to drive public awareness and strengthen advocacy towards a healthy future for today's children and young people and for the next generations. It is designed to be a high level policy and advocacy tool that can be used to ensure children's and young people's wellbeing is front and centre in policy decisions over the next seven years. In this first inaugural Future Healthy Countdown 2030 supplement, we asked Australia's experts across child and youth health and wellbeing to canvass each of the seven domains used in the Countdown framework. They were asked to propose key indicators for progress in these domains for all children and young people and, most importantly, for children in Australia who are the most vulnerable to poor outcomes. We plan to publish a refined set of Countdown indicators with more in-depth analysis of each domain in 2024. The Countdown brings together experts from a range of disciplines across the traditional silos of child and adolescent research and policy work. Further development of the Countdown indicators and annual reports will be enriched by increased diversity of leadership from a broader range of disciplines, sectors and priority population groups relevant to the future health and wellbeing of children and young people, including the input of children and young people themselves. Recognising young people as experts in their lives and concerns is central to this collaborative work. Future Countdown supplements and annual reporting will be framed by the concerns and aspirations of children and young people through qualitative data analysis each year — the Countdown is intended to enable their voices to provide a powerful narrative for change. The next seven perspective articles in this supplement present each domain that comprises the Countdown and the outcomes that most critically affect children and young people's health and wellbeing. During the coming year, we will develop a concise set of core Countdown indicators encompassing these domains to track progress on the indicators of change that demonstrate a real difference to the lives of children and young people by 2030. We intend to present the Countdown's core indicators in a 2024 supplement in the MJA and report against them each year as we count down to 2030. A simple, concise set of measures is critical for policy makers to prioritise budgetary decisions that have public support. There are strong frameworks and vast research evidence to support prioritising effective policy action for Australia's children and young people, to protect and support at-risk and vulnerable children and benefit future generations. Policy action requires both public interest and accountability mechanisms at the whole-of-government level, just like core economic metrics. Accountability lies with us all, but, in particular, accountability means holding those with power to protect and improve the circumstances of children and young people to account (eg, policy makers, government and commercial and other societal institutions). The Future Healthy Countdown aims to do this. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that almost anything is possible, so if not now, then when? It is no longer acceptable to simply observe the inequities facing children and young people in Australia. We must capture the current interest, policy landscape and political will to address the “wicked problems” facing Australian children, young people and future generations to ensure they have opportunity to thrive in a sustainable and equitable Australia, for all of us. This article is part of the MJA supplement on the Future Healthy Countdown 2030, which was funded by the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth) — a pioneer in health promotion that was established by the Parliament of Victoria as part of the Tobacco Act 1987, and an organisation that is primarily focused on promoting good health and preventing chronic disease for all. VicHealth has played a convening role in scoping and commissioning the articles contained in the supplement.

We make new contributions by analyzing rich panel SWB data from Russia over the past quarter century, which address various shortcomings with traditional income data. We find that intergenerational SWB mobility - as measured by subjective wealth and life satisfaction - exists, with daughters having higher transmission of SWB from their mothers than sons. Adding other child and parent characteristics to the multivariate regression models can reduce the estimated impacts of mothers' SWB by up to 40% but does not change the gender gaps in the intergenerational transmission.

In Latin America in particular, cash transfer programs have adopted a multidimensional approach to poverty, whereby income support is provided together with simultaneous interventions in health, education, and nutrition. This “human development” approach to poverty reduction places a strong emphasis on tackling the intergenerational transmission of poverty through human capital investment (Levy and Schady 2013; Niño-Zarazúa 2011; Levy 2006). Mexico's Progresa-Oportunidades-Prospera, Brazil's Bolsa Familia, Colombia's Familias en Acción, and Chile Solidario are prominent examples of this antipoverty policy framework. The incentive mechanisms that cash transfers generate for schooling decisions are instrumental in enhancing human capital formation and tackling the structural roots of poverty (Parker, Rubalcava, and Teruel 2007). Monetary incentives are particularly important, as they link income support with mandatory regular school attendance. This is done through explicit conditions that are monitored and enforced with varying degrees of effort and efficacy across countries.1 Since cash transfers target the poor, monetary incentives can have both an income effect (contingent on the size of transfers, relative to household income) and a substitution effect, which materializes through a reduction in the shadow prices of education and which in turn can affect decisions on both schooling and child labor (Behrman, Parker, and Todd 2009; Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Leite 2003). The empirical literature on the impacts of cash transfer programs on schooling and child labor has shown that overall, cash transfers can successfully raise school enrollment and attendance (Attanasio et al. 2010; Dammert 2009; Schady and Araujo 2006; Skoufias et al. 2001); under certain conditions, they can also delay or reduce child labor, both the likelihood of children working and the intensity of work for those who do work (Behrman et al. 2012; de Janvry et al. 2006; Ferro, Kassouf, and Levison 2010; Schultz 2004; Skoufias et al., 2001). In this article, we investigate the schooling and labor market impacts of Bolivia's Bono Juancito Pinto (BJP), a cash transfer program launched by the Bolivian government with the explicit objective of improving enrollment, retention, and completion rates of pupils in public schools. Unlike other cash transfer programs in Latin America, BJP does not follow a strict poverty-targeting mechanism; instead, it is nearly universal in its coverage, as it covers 90 percent of school-age children who are enrolled in public schools. The program began in 2006 by providing income support of 200 Bolivianos per year (about US$25) to children enrolled in grades 1–5 of primary school. In subsequent years, the government gradually expanded its coverage to include children in secondary education, raising the number of beneficiaries from nearly 1.1 million school-aged children in 2006 to 2.1 million in 2014. Using data from the Bolivian National Living Standards Survey, we exploited the exogenous variation in the timing of the announcement of the program expansion, as well as the changing age eligibility criteria, for identification. More specifically, we resort to difference-in-differences (DD) estimators to measure the effect of the program on schooling and the incidence and intensity of child labor.2 This article contributes to the literature on cash transfer programs in three ways. This is the first study that estimates the impact of the BJP program among children in secondary school, the level at which important occupational transitions take place in the country. Additionally, while most studies have focused on the incidence of child labor, we also provide evidence of the impact of the BJP program on the intensity of child labor. Finally, our identification strategy—relying on eligibility—solves the problem of selection bias seen in previous studies. In situations of poverty, where children's and adults’ labor income are substitutable, child labor arises not because of parental exploitation, but because of the need for additional sources of income (Basu and Van 1998). Legal frameworks prohibiting child labor would only be effective if policy interventions were in place to reduce households’ liquidity constraints and compensate them for the income loss from schooling. It is important to distinguish here between children's participation in the labor market and the intensity of their engagement. Patrinos and Psacharopoulos (1997) have pointed out that the allegedly mutually exclusive relationship between child labor and schooling is not linear, particularly when labor is part-time and acts not as a substitute for children's time in school, but rather as a complementary strategy that may in fact allow children to continue their education. In the particular context of cash transfer programs, the literature has largely focused on short-term effects on schooling (Akresh, de Walque, and Kazianga 2013; Behrman, Parker, and Todd 2009; Dammert 2009; Filmer and Schady 2008; Lincove and Parker 2016; Maluccio and Flores 2005; Skoufias et al. 2001) and on child labor (Behrman et al. 2012; Edmonds and Schady 2012; Ferro, Kassouf, and Levison et al. 2010; Skoufias et al. 2001).3 Cash transfer programs are conventionally not designed with the explicit objective of reducing child labor. They have, however, proven to be effective—under certain conditions—at lowering children's participation in the labor market (Behrman et al. 2012; de Janvry et al., 2006; Schultz 2004; Skoufias et al. 2001). This is important, because early entry into the labor market can lead to school dropout, which has long-term implications for children's future income and well-being in adulthood (Canelas 2015). In several contexts, child labor can also be associated with hazardous employment, with its detrimental and long-term negative consequences (Anker 2000; Edmonds and Pavcnik 2005; Ide and Parker 2005). Thus, reducing child labor can be generally regarded as a positive contribution of cash transfers toward sustained efforts to reduce poverty and vulnerability. In Colombia, for example, Familias en Acción led to a significant reduction in domestic work in rural areas, particularly among children ages 8–13 (Attanasio et al. 2010). Similar effects were found in Nicaragua's Red de Protección Social for children in the same age-group (Barrientos and Santibañez 2009) and among beneficiary children of Ecuador's Bono de Desarrollo Humano (Schady and Araujo 2006). Similarly, a study of Brazil's Programa de Erradicação do Trabalho Infantil, or PETI (Child Labor Eradication Program) found that the program increased children's time in school, improved academic success, and reduced labor participation and hazardous work (Yap, Sedlacek, and Orazem 2009). In Mexico, Rawlings and Rubio (2005) found small but significant reductions in child labor among beneficiaries of Progresa-Oportunidades, although no significant reduction was found for boys aged 16–17, a finding linked to the increasing opportunity cost of schooling. In Costa Rica, Superémonos increased school attendance and educational attainment among poor children, but there was no evidence of a reduction in child labor (Duryea and Morrison 2004). A review by de Hoop and Rosati (2014) identified 30 studies worldwide, among which 23 were of cash transfer programs implemented in Latin America. None of these studies addressed Bolivia's BJP program. Most studies cited in the review focused largely on the incidence of child labor; however, little attention was paid to the intensity of child labor, with the notable exceptions of the work of Skoufias et al. (2001), Ferreira, Filmer, and Schady (2009), Attanasio et al. (2010), Gee (2010), and Del Carpio and Loayza (2012). In the specific context of Bolivia, scholarly work on the impact of BJP on schooling and child labor is scant. The few studies available, while providing useful information, remain limited in their focus and methods. For instance, using household survey data for the period 1999–2007, Grigoli and Sbrana (2013) found that being a recipient of BJP in 2006 increased school enrollment in 2007 but had no effect on school attendance or child labor. The study relied on whether children enrolled in school in 2007 reported receiving the transfer in 2006. This created a selection bias, since children who were reported in the 2007 survey as having received BJP in 2006 had already met the enrollment and attendance conditions for 2006 and thus may have been predisposed to meet them again in 2007, with or without the stipend. Using static microsimulation techniques with data for 2005, Yáñez (2012) found that BJP had a small effect on school enrollment and attendance, which in turn led to a lower incidence of child labor and poverty. Hernani-Limarino (2015) examined the effect of the program covering the period 2005–2009 and found a positive effect on school enrollment for children aged 6–8. More recently, Vera-Cossio (2017) looked at the effect of BJP on adult female labor supply from households with eligible children and found that BJP increased adult female working hours by 8 percent, a change largely explained by credit constraints and fixed costs of labor. The BJP program was introduced in 2006, initially with the objective of promoting school enrollment, retention in school, and completion of the first five years of primary education in public educational institutions across the country. However, since 2007, program eligibility gradually expanded, and by 2014 BJP covered all levels of primary and secondary education. Children 6–19 years of age attending public schools are eligible to receive support from the program. The transfer consists of a yearly payment of 200 Bolivianos (approximately US$25), conditional on proven school attendance during the school year. The transfer is paid in cash at the end of each school year directly to the children. It is distributed at ceremonies for that purpose, guarded with the help of the armed forces. According to official estimates, between 2006 and 2014, the number of beneficiaries increased from nearly 1.1 million to 2.1 million school-age children enrolled in public schools. The program currently costs about 0.3 percent of Bolivia's gross domestic product. Table 1 shows the coverage and roll-out process of BJP. Relevant for our analysis is the timing of the public announcement of the program. The Bolivian government announced the creation of BJP in December 2006 to initially cover, as discussed earlier, children who were enrolled in grades 1–5 of primary school and who had complied with the program conditions. Thus, at the beginning of the 2007 school year, eligible children were those who had at most four years of schooling and had the choice of enrolling (or not) in grades 1–5 of primary school. A year later, in October 2007, the government announced the expansion of the program to include children enrolled in grade 6 of primary school. This meant that eligible children were those with at most five years of schooling by the time of the announcement. In July 2008, the government announced a further expansion of the program to include children enrolled up to grade 8 (i.e., the second year of secondary education). BJP remained unchanged until October 2012, when the government announced a further expansion to include children enrolled in grade 9 (i.e., the third year of secondary school). That meant that at the beginning of the 2013 school year, eligible children were those who had completed at most eight years of schooling, (i.e., up to the second year of secondary school). The progressive expansion of BJP continued until October 2014, when the program covered the entire range of primary and secondary education levels, including high school (see Table 1). The data used in this study come from the Bolivian National Living Standards Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida) for the period 2005–2013, which was conducted by Bolivia's National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Bolivia [INE]). This is a nationally representative household survey of the Bolivian population. The survey collects detailed information on household demographic characteristics, health, education, occupations and labor force participation, housing and asset ownership, household food and nonfood expenditures, and income, including contributions from social assistance. It also gathers information on whether the individual has participated in paid or unpaid market activities for a private and/or family business and the number of hours allocated to these activities. Unfortunately, it does not obtain information on domestic tasks and leisure time activities. We focused our analysis on children aged 7–17 years, as this is the age cohort that is covered by primary and secondary education in Bolivia, and also the age range in which children are reported to have engaged in paid or unpaid work in the previous week in any of the following activities: (1) working in agricultural activities or caring for animals; (2) helping in the family business; (3) selling products; (4) making products to sell; and (5) providing services for payment (washing clothes, cutting hair, teaching, etc.). We took a broader definition of schooling to measure children enrolled in school in the reported academic year. Formal education in Bolivia starts at the age of 6. Education is free of tuition fees and since 2009 is compulsory throughout all primary and secondary levels. The school year starts in February and lasts until the end of October or early November. Primary and secondary education consist of six years of education each. Each academic year lasts for about 40 weeks, five days per week and four hours per day.4 Short school days and a lax legal framework that allows child labor from the age of 10 has meant that about 20 percent of children aged 7–14 engage in labor activities (Bureau of International Labor Affairs 2014).5 In rural areas in particular, child labor—especially related to agriculture—is embedded in normative aspects and tradition, whereby it is considered as part of children's instruction and skill development (Fontana and Grugel 2015, 2017). The considerably high incidence of child labor is captured in Table 2, which shows basic statistics on school enrollment, work participation, and time allocated to income-generating activities during the week prior to the survey interview. While children's work participation has declined slightly between 2005–2006 and 2013, its incidence remains high and at a level twice that of the Latin American average (UNICEF 2017). Table 3 shows the status of children in the school system between 2005–2006 and 2013. Retention rates were relatively high, although there was slow progress throughout the school grades. The proportion of children behind the corresponding grade for age was high, particularly at baseline in 2006. This can be explained to a certain extent by late school entry rates: 39 percent of children aged 6–8 were not enrolled in school in 2006, and 45 percent of children aged 9–11 were enrolled in a lower grade than the one corresponding to their age. In more recent years, the basic education system has achieved some progress. For example, by 2013, 68 percent of school-age children were in the school grade corresponding to their age, while 26 percent had fallen behind and only 4 percent had dropped out of school altogether.6 BJP targets all children enrolled in public primary and secondary schools; while the transfer benefits all children independent of their socioeconomic status, coverage has expanded gradually over time. We exploited this variation in coverage to compare children who were eligible to receive the cash transfer (the treatment group) with those children who were just above the eligibility threshold at the same point in time and who therefore did not benefit fully from the program throughout the entire period covered in the analysis (the control group). A second source of variation comes from the timing of the announcement of the program expansion. We also exploited this exogenous variation to estimate the differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups before and after the program implementation, in a DD framework. The basic idea behind our identification strategy is illustrated in Table 4. For the analysis, we focused on the last school grade covered by the program in the last available survey. We did so for several reasons. First, enrollment rates in primary school in Bolivia are relatively high. In fact, primary school is almost universal, so if the transfer is effective in increasing enrollment rates and school retention, this is more likely to be observed in secondary education, in which occupational transitions and school dropout rates are more common. Therefore, for our analysis, it was more relevant to test whether vulnerable groups who were more likely to drop out of school and work more intensively—due to an increasing opportunity cost of schooling—improved their schooling achievements relative to the pretreatment period. Second, by using the last available survey and looking at the behavior of children and their schooling and work decisions in the last covered school year in the survey, we can take advantage of their cumulative exposure to the program, meaning that those children who were last covered by the program were also exposed to the cash transfer for a longer period of time. By 2013, children who had completed at most eight years of schooling at the beginning of the 2013 school year were eligible to receive BJP. In this case, our treatment group consisted of children who had completed eight years of schooling, whereas the control group was made of children who had completed nine years of schooling and were not eligible to receive BJP at the end of that academic year. We note, however, that with the 2013 sample, the control group might have been exposed to the program in earlier years and therefore cannot be used to measure the average treatment effect of the program, but just the effect of the program in grade 9, the period in which a very important school–labor market transition occurs in Bolivia. To get a better sense of the broader impact of the program, we also used data from the 2011 survey, where children with nine years of schooling had not been exposed to the program, and estimated the DD matching estimators, following the framework described below. The results, presented in Appendix Table A6, were very similar in terms of size and direction.7 A potential source of concern for this strategy comes from the fact that the treatment and control groups in the postprogram period were from samples with a one-year gap. However, in the absence of any major shock that could have affected schooling decisions between these two groups, we are confident that children with nine years of schooling in 2011 are a good control group for the postprogram period. Nevertheless, while our matching estimator should minimize any remaining source of observed heterogeneity, we acknowledge this data limitation and caution concerning the policy interpretations of our findings. The DD estimates would provide unbiased treatment effects of the program in ninth grade under the assumption of “parallel trends”—that is, in the absence of the treatment, the outcomes of the two groups would have followed similar trends. As noted by Attanasio et al. (2010), while this assumption cannot be tested formally, it is useful for comparing trends in outcomes between the treatment and control groups before the program started. If they are similar, it is likely they would have been the same in the posttreatment period in the absence of the program. We tested this formally using data from the pretreatment period (2005–2006). The results, presented in Appendix Table A9, indicate that time trends were similar for treatment and comparison groups. Appendix Tables A1–A5 show the characteristics of matched and unmatched samples at baseline and the different tests concerning the balancing property of the different groups. In general, the matching substantially improved the quality of the comparison, as shown by both the reduction in the mean absolute standardized bias and in the pseudo R2 of the probit model for the selection of treated children. For reference, we also present the p values of the mean differences for each of the observed characteristics we controlled for. We note, however, that t-tests and other statistical tests of hypothesis are influenced by the sample size, and therefore we expected few significant differences between the treated and controls to remain after the matching for the subsamples under analysis. Finally, given the nature of the outcome variables (two dichotomous and one censored at 0), we should ideally have performed the estimation using nonlinear models (i.e., probit and tobit); however, as pointed out by Greene (2010), while the marginal effects of the interaction terms can be computed, testing their statistical significance is not possible. We therefore carried out the estimations using ordinary least squares (OLS). A few remaining concerns about identification are addressed in Appendix B. We report here the results first for the full sample and then for different subpopulations. Tables 5 and 6 show the effect of BJP on the probability of school enrollment and labor force participation among children in the ninth grade, while Appendix Table A6 presents the results for the 2011 sample, which captures the average treatment effects of the program. Table 7 presents results on the intensity of child labor. Here, the idea is that while the transfer size is too small to alter labor force participation of children, it may still affect the number of hours children spend working during the week. The first columns of Tables 5 and 6 report the DDM estimates on the full sample. Overall, we found an increase in the likelihood of school enrollment of 5 percent in ninth grade. The effect was nearly identical when the full average treatment effect of the program was measured using the 2011 sample (see Appendix Table A6). This is quite significant, given the important occupational transitions that usually occur at that age in Bolivia. Unsurprisingly, the program had no sizable impact on child labor, either at the extensive or intensive margin. In general, our results are consistent with previous work on cash transfer programs in Latin America, including those of Schultz (2004) in Mexico, Macours and Vakis (2009) in Nicaragua, and Attanasio et al. (2010) in Colombia. Rural-urban differences in living standards are marked in Bolivia. In 2006, 76.5 percent of the rural population were poor9 (that is, eight in every 10 persons); in urban areas, this proportion amounted to 50.3 percent. Differences in extreme poverty levels were even more striking, with rates of 62.3 percent in rural areas and 23.4 percent in urban areas. The incidence of child labor is also high. The labor participation rate was 64.9 percent among rural children and 17.0 percent among urban children. In this context, it is expected that the transfer will have different impacts according to the geographic location of the household. Columns 2 and 3 of Tables 5 and 6 and Appendix Table A6 present the results of the DDM estimates by area of residence. The transfer had a significant positive effect on school enrollment in rural areas, but not in urban areas. While the coefficients of work participation and work intensity both had the desired negative sign in both rural and urban areas, the estimates were not statistically significant. Bolivia's educational system allows children to work, since the school day lasts on average only four hours. As a result, an important percentage of children combine work and schooling. This fact, coupled with the small amount of the transfer, can explain, in our judgment, the nonsignificant effect of the program on child labor. In 2008, a study on child labor in Bolivia carried out by Bolivia's National Statistical Institute and the International Labour Organization revealed that the monthly average salary of children aged 14–17 was 633 Bolivianos in urban areas and 657 Bolivianos in rural areas.10 This means that in 2008 the BJP represented on average just about 2.5 percent of children's income in both urban and rural areas. Bolivia does not have a significant gender gap with regard to school attendance. Regarding child labor, however, it is more common to find boys working in productive activities, paid or unpaid, while girls are mostly confined to household chores. Columns 4 and 5 of Tables 5 and 6 and Appendix Table A6 present the gender results by focusing on girls and boys separately. Similarly, to the previous estimations, we found statistically significant results only for school enrollment, although the likelihood of schooling increased only for girls. In the absence of time-use data on domestic activities and leisure time, we were unable to account for the substitution effects between different activities. In the case of girls in particular, the traditional division of labor led us to infer that the increase in school enrollment reduced the time allocated to household chores. Unfortunately, we were unable to test whether this was the case. The results for child labor remained virtually unchanged irrespective of sex. Once again, the monetary value of the transfer, which was too low to compensate for the opportunity cost of schooling, seemed to provide a sensible explanation for absence of impact. Bolivia's National Statistical Institute (INE, 2010) reported that boys aged 14–17 years earned on average 715 Bolivianos per month. Their salary was also 1.6 times higher than that of girls (457 in urban areas and 427 in rural areas). In this context, the BJP transfer accounted for only two percent of a boy's monthly earnings. Finally, in this section, we tested whether the positive effect of the program on schooling is robust by controlling for spillover effects at the household level. Appendix Table A7 presents the results of Equation 4. The coefficient of interest α captures the spillover effects of the transfer in 2013. If significant, spillover effects cannot be rejected. As shown in Table A7, the results were robust to spillover effects at the household level for all specifications. Different from other cash transfer programs in Latin America, BJP is nearly universal, with coverage of about 90 percent of school-aged children who are enrolled in public schools in Bolivia. By adopting a DDM approach, we assessed the effect of the program on schooling and child labor decisions at an important juncture in the life of young people. Overall, we found evidence that the program has been successful in increasing school enrollment rates, which is consistent with previous scholarly work; however, we observed no evidence of program effects on child labor. There are at least two potential explanations for this result. First, the monetary value of the transfer may have been too low to compensate for the increasing opportunity cost of schooling, particularly among children aged 13–16, the period in which important school–labor market transitions occur in Bolivia. Second, the structure of the educational system, together with high poverty rates, normative factors, and a lax legal framework that regulates child labor in the country, allowed children to combine schooling with income-generating activities. One immediate implication of our findings is that parents are likely to substitute other uses of their children's time, such as leisure. So, in the presence of child labor, an increase in school participation may come at the expense of a reduction in children's leisure time, including playing and recreational activities, with important consequences for their cognitive, emotional, and physical development. This is an important area for future research. Grade repetition rates SOURCE: Author calculations, based on the Ministry of Education data. Dropout rates by education level SOURCE: Authors based on the Ministry of Education figures. There are a few remaining concerns about our identification strategy. The first relates to the fact that the transfer was directed only to children enrolled in public schools—90 percent of all school-age children in the country. If the transfer were to become an incentive for children in private schools to switch to public schools, our results would be biased. We argue that given the small amount of the transfer and the fact that children in private schools usually come from better-off families, this situation is highly unlikely. Previous studies have emphasized that efforts to keep children in school through legal instruments, without a good understanding of the economic and social constraints faced by the poor and vulnerable, can only have limited success (Jacoby and Skoufias 1997; Lleras-Muney 2002). Indeed, by 2018, almost 10 years after the introduction of the constitutional reform, there were still children out of school. Moreover, while school dropout rates have fallen steadily (see Appendix Figure A2), this decline began much earlier than 2009 (in fact, in around 2006), at the time BJP was introduced. Nevertheless, universal education at both the primary and secondary levels remains a priority for the Bolivian government, and the BJP has become one instrument to achieve that goal (if not the main one). Previous analyses have attributed the decreasing dropout rates to the BJP (UNICEF 2011; Peredo-Videa 2013; UNESCO 2014; Ministerio de Educación 2015), including qualitative studies that interviewed school headmasters, teachers, and parents (Navarro 2012; Observatorio Social de Políticas Educativas de Bolivia 2011).",,C.

improving in every country on the planet, thanks to the control and prevention of infectious diseases in the 20th century. The global average life expectancy at birth improved from 46.5 years in 1950 to 70.8 in 2015 and is expected to increase to 77.0 in 2050.[1] The World Health Organization (WHO) states that an aging population is a triumph of modern society. A population that has aged shows that social and health practices have been put into place that have extended life and reduced premature deaths earlier in the life course. As a result, at the turn of the millennium, there are more people living and the global population is growing. The world is now facing a new challenge: soon, we will have a larger number of older people than children and more people at extreme old age than ever before. For example, there are more than 60,000 people in Japan alone who are over the age of 100. The comparator is to count the population between the ages of 0–4 (children) and those over the age of 64, globally. In 1950, there were 335 million children and just 131 million people aged 65 years or more. According to the United Nation's Population Division estimates for mid-2010, there were 642 million children and 523 million over the age of 65. The UN also projects that, for the 1st time in history, the 0–4 age group will decline between 2015 and 2020, having peaked at around 650 million. The 65+ population is projected to exceed the 0–4 population during that same 5-year period, rising from 601 million in 2015 to 714 million in 2020 although precisely when that happens will depend on birth rates in developing countries. In fact, it just happened in Canada in March 2017. As both the proportion of older people and the length of life increase throughout the world, a major review done by the US National Institute on Aging and the WHO,[2] raises some key questions: What is the scope of aging population? Will it be accompanied by a longer period of good health, and sustained sense of well-being or will it be associated with more illness, disability, and dependency? How will aging affect the already strained health care and social costs? Is there any way we can act to establish an infrastructure “ both physical and social “ to foster better health and well-being in older age? In other words, are we prepared to meet the challenges of aging? What about population aging in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), which is rapidly aging both in proportion and absolute numbers than their counterparts in the high-income countries? To answer these and many other emerging questions, we need to look at the changing epidemiological transition combined with rapid demographic changes in all parts of the world. There are more people living with chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) with an increased burden of disability to the individuals, their families, and the society at large. In older people, in addition to the conventional NCD such as cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, the major issues are isolation, depression, and dementia. In today's world, increasing chronic diseases can be attributed to changes in lifestyle and diet, as well as aging. The potential economic and societal costs of NCD of this type rise sharply with age and could affect economic growth of the countries. Healthy aging is determined by the following four influencers: (1) Environmental: adequate housing, family composition, education level/economical level, infectious disease exposure, toxic substance exposure, radiation exposure, and violence exposure; (2) Health Care: the 3 A's - availability, accessibility, and affordability; (3) Lifestyle: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, inadequate activity, alcohol abuse, and risky behaviors leading to injuries; and (4) of course, Genetics: race, sex, and genetic make-up, of which we have little control. All G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States - recognized the implications of aging and have vested in the health of senior citizens to address the three influencers “ environment, health care, and lifestyle. Likewise, the Scandinavian countries have put in policies and programs in favor of healthy senior citizens. Can we adapt the lessons learned from these countries in other parts of the world, especially in the LMIC? Active aging is the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation, and security to enhance the quality of life as people age. In an age-friendly city, policies, services, settings, and structures support and enable people to age actively by recognizing the wide range of capacities and resources among older people; anticipating and responding flexibly to aging-related needs and preferences; respecting their decisions and lifestyle choices; protecting those who are most vulnerable; and promoting their inclusion in and contribution to all areas of community life. Active aging depends on a variety of influencers or determinants that surround individuals, families, and nations. They include material conditions as well as social factors that affect individual types of behavior and feelings. These factors and the interaction between them play an important role in affecting how well individuals age. Many aspects of urban settings and services reflect these determinants and are essential characteristic features of an age-friendly city.[3] Elements of an age-friendly city are housing, social participation, respect and social inclusion, civic participation and employment, communication and information, community support and health services, outdoor spaces and buildings, and transportation. In fact, many of the Western countries have put programs in places to have age-friendly healthy cities in their urban development plans. In fact, in Canada, the main discussion is around affordable housing, particularly to seniors, who in general have reduced income. Most G7 and Scandinavian countries have a social security system that protects the seniors to have adequate economic support to sustain for the rest of their lives. In Canada, three sources of economic security to the seniors are (1) Canada Pension Plan, based on the number of years one has contributed, during the working years, to the plan; (2) those who are over the age of 65 and below a certain threshold of income qualify for Old Age Security; and (3) those whose income from all sources is below a certain threshold level are entitled to Guaranteed Income Supplement, which brings them well above the national poverty line.[4] Similar arrangements have been reported in the Western European countries of Italy, Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. Combined with Universal Health coverage and guaranteed minimum income for seniors, they can live independently as long as they could and then move into an assisted living facility and finally transfer to nursing homes. In the context of rapidly aging population worldwide, the health care of the elderly has become a major concern. To meet the needs of the growing elderly population worldwide, the WHO has restructured its program on the health of the elderly and named it Ageing and Health as early as 1977.[5] Rather than focus upon a static age group apart from the rest of the population, efforts were made to view aging as merely one stage during individuals' lives. Program activities approach aging as part of the lifecycle, promote long-term health, observe cultural influences, adopt community-oriented approaches, recognize gender differences, and strengthen intergenerational links.[5] When dealing with the functional capacity of individuals, the WHO suggests that people should perform above a disability threshold. During the very early life “ growth and development phase “ the functional capacities continue to increase until the adult life and begin to decline as people age and feel severe shortage of functional capacity in the older ages. Practicing healthy lifestyle during adult ages along with proper nutrition could prevent a rapid loss of functional capacity and will prevent rapid decline of health in older ages. The supporting programs such as rehabilitation and ensuring quality of life have been proven to maintain independence and to prevent disability during the older ages. With the attempted universal health care in most countries of the world, plans must be in place to deal with aging and aging-related diseases. Italy is the country with highest resource allocation for seniors and their care at 15.6% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. Most Western European countries and North America, except Mexico, spend over 10% of GDP among senior citizens. The two most populous countries on the face of this planet China and India spend relatively less GDP at present. For example, in China, the current expenditure is at 3.4% of GDP and the planned increase to 2050 is at 10.0%, almost in par with most Western European countries. Whereas India is spending only 1.0% of GDP now and is expected to reduce to 0.7% in 2050.[1] When the International Monetary Fund[6] evaluated the Old Age Dependency Ratio (OADR), defined as the number of people older than 64 per 100 working age people (15–64 years) and compared between 2010 and 2050, the ratios are staggering. In all countries studied, the rise in OADR was almost double. For example, in the United States, OADR went up from 19% in 2010 to 36% in 2050. Similar increases for Brazil (10%–36%), Mexico (9%–32%), Turkey (11%–34%), Germany (32%–60%), France (26%–44%), Italy (31%–62%), India (8%–19%), China (11%–39%), Japan (36%–72%), and South Korea (15%–66%). The lowest OADR is in India “ both in 2010 and 2050. The highest jump in OADR from 2010 to 2050 was observed in South Korea, >4 times or 400%. Thus, aging is clearly an economic issue which needs to be dealt with. Many countries are grappling with this imminent burden in different ways according to its economic levels and culture. There are a number of programs which are successful and cost effective that can be transported to many of the countries in economic transition. The sooner the country's administration recognizes the impending aging tsunami, better it is to cope up.","© 2017 International Journal of Noncommunicable Diseases | Published by Wolters Kluwer ‐ Medknow It is a well‐known fact that life expectancy keeps improving in every country on the planet, thanks to the control and prevention of infectious diseases in the 20th century.

recognizing how previous understandings of social justice issues failed to account for reports on climate change. As the rate of change in the earth’s ecosystems continues to impact individuals’ daily lives through droughts, warming, acidifying oceans, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and the disappearance of species and their habitats; the emancipatory vocabulary handed down from the long tradition of social justice struggles in the West must be revised.This does not mean abandoning common educational reforms that challenge how the West’s consumer-dependent industrial, and now digital, revolution continues the old forms of injustice and perpetuates new ones as globalization continues. What needs to be revised is the vocabulary that supports the West’s interpretation of progress. Ironic as it may be, the social justice agenda of educational reformers, as well as the neoliberal agenda of computer scientists, corporations, and the government’s foreign policies both use the same conception of progress; and that conception is causing grave problems.Across the political spectrum people are thinking of “progress” in terms of vocabularies inherited from the legacy of the Enlightenment thinkers of the late 16th and 17th century. That legacy was founded on concepts like individualism (with the ideal being the autonomous thinking individual), change and innovation, critical inquiry and science overturning traditions, transformative thinking, freedom, and literacy. These values are are meant to lead to objective knowledge and individual empowerment that is epitomized by students constructing their own knowledge and values from the available data.Still today, “progress” the most powerful word for legitimating ideas, policies, innovations, and the continual quest for the new and experimental. In this context, progress is understood as overcoming the backwardness of the past — that is, overcoming traditions. When Enlightenment thinkers, or modern scientists such as Carl Sagan, claim that “we give our highest rewards to those who convincingly disprove established beliefs” (Sagan, 1997, 35), they fail to understand that social justice achievements of history, such as habeas corpus, become traditions. By reducing traditions to abstractions Sagan and other anti-tradition thinkers failed to recognize the traditions they relied upon daily. They also failed to recognize that overturning traditions, is itself a tradition.Following in the tradition of ethnographically uninformed thinking of John Locke, René Descartes, John Dewey, and Paulo Freire, most of today’s critical pedagogy reformers continue to share the same Enlightenment view of traditions as sources of oppression and backwardness. But overturning traditions in the name of progress is a complicated affair. While educational reforms seek progress in the name of justice, computer scientists and neoliberal and heads of corporations rely upon this same Enlightenment vocabulary to justify overturning cultural traditions throughout the world in order promote consumer-dependent and environmentally destructive lifestyles.The irony is that none of these Enlightenment thinkers had a deep cultural understanding of the traditions they took for granted — even as they relied upon the many traditions built up over generations to write their books. The tradition they relied upon most is still so powerful, that we often fail to even recognize it as a choice at all: writing. They relied upon the long standing tradition of the early Greeks who encoded their ideas in the printed word to foster abstract thinking. This emphasis stifled awareness of the lived cultural patterns that connect within different face-to-face relationships.The anti-tradition abstract theorists of the past (as well as those still under the spell of the Enlightenment legacy that have morphed into today’s progressive ideologies) ignored how the crafts and skills used to create their dwellings, grow their food, provide the artistic performances of the day, and even enact social justice were embodied and passed through generations. Living is so much richer than can be contained in a word printed on paper.An even greater loss is that if these Enlightenment thinkers had been less ethnocentric and ignorant of environmental limits, they might have detected the interconnectedness between their traditions and their development of ecological intelligence from indigenous cultures.Silences and misconceptions of Enlightenment thinking are still being carried forward by computer scientists, hubris driven researchers genetically re-engineering the biological world, academics, teachers, and curriculum theorists. In confronting this, we will be well served to remember that one of the traditions of Enlightenment philosophers that is being carried forward, is to ignore the practices of cultures that failed to recognize environmental limits and eventually died off.In Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed (2005), Jared Diamond documents the experience of cultures that failed to recognize that their forms of intelligence were unable to understand the emergent, relational, and co-dependent nature of the ecological systems they were dependent upon. The vocabularies that support the West’s understanding of progress as emancipation from tradition that leads to ever more profits leaves little space for recognition of distinctive cultural expressions of ecological intelligence.In order to slow environmental degradation and end the West’s messianic tradition of economic and technological colonization, we need a social justice vocabulary that does not repeat the naive anti-tradition tendencies of the Enlightenment. We must notice that neoliberal and libertarian promoters of consumerism, worker exploitation, and over turning civil liberties couch there philosophies in the the name of progress; and social justice educators are taking this progress oriented vocabulary to articulate their own goals. In imagining justice to be only emancipation from tradition, reformers are losing sight of the wisdom held by tradition, and repeating many of the very mistakes they are fighting against.As educational reformers begin to recognize that the warnings of environmental scientists must now be taken seriously, they are likely to be caught in the same conceptual double bind as the sixty or so percent of the public that is concerned about what the future holds for them: they understand the need to change, but are unable to imagine the nature of the lifestyle changes that must be undertaken. The double bind is rooted in being educated to think of themselves as autonomous individuals, in an environment they have traditionally exploited, and in a world of unending progress. Too many people, including curriculum theorists, cannot see and teach alternatives to the misconceptions that are at the core of the Enlightenment progress-oriented paradigm. People will be stuck unless they can see that the ecological crisis is also a cultural crisis.The way out of this double bind, where “progress” reigns supreme, is to begin to think within an ecologically informed paradigm that takes account of how all life forms are emergent, relational, co-dependent, and participanting in different ecologies of information and semiotic exchange. We can begin by recognizing that everything has a history. Cell behavior, insect communication, personal identities, oral and print communication, and ideologies that justify exploitation all arise because of a complex and interconnected set of causal factors. We should not see these phenomenon as separate, but rather as part of a complex ecology of thoughts and things.All ecologies involve observable patterns and relational networks of communication, and it is these observable connecting patterns that provide evidence of whether ecology is headed in a sustainable direction, or if it is a self-destructive mode. Relying upon an ecological paradigm as the source of knowledge means giving close attention to the emergent nature of lived cultural and environmental patterns rather than relying upon the printed word which generally overlooks the interpretations of the writer, and later the reader, as well as the interpretation of classroom teachers and professors who are often unaware of their own assumptions.In order to invite people into this way of thinking, we need a new vocabulary of social and environmental justice that supports the exercise of ecologically informed intelligence and intergenerational knowledge. We need to start speaking in words like: ecological sustainability, ecological intelligence, intergenerational knowledge and skills, traditions of social justice, indigenous knowledge and skills, wisdom, critical inquiry and exploration, double bind thinking, cultural/bio conservatism, non-monetized relationships and practices, face to face communication, living in an interpreted world, ethnically diverse cultural commons, enclosure of the commons, and so forth.This vocabulary is also relevant for understanding how cultural and natural ecologies differ from the neoliberal/libertarian (Enlightenment) paradigm that is being promoted by many computer scientists, engineers, and corporate heads who do harm in the name of “progress.” By differentiating our vocabulary we can see the fundamental problems of Enlightenment thinking more clearly: data collections that can birth artificial intelligence and algorithms that eliminate jobs and amasses profits is lauded as innovation; long term memory is being replaced by short term memory; face to face relationships are being replaced by abstract relationships; monetized activities and relationships are leading to digital profiles that are sold to corporations and governments; intergenerational knowledge and skills essential to viable cultural commons — and that have smaller ecological footprints — are being replaced by the convenience and efficiency of online consuming; and the Internet is undermining privacy and birthing hackers, cyber attackers, and extremist groups along with all of the good it brings.We are fast losing our civil liberties as governments become more able to gather data to anticipate possible behavior in order to do “predictive policing” and post photographs of millions of people on the FBI network without their consent. How does one explain the willingness of so many people to exchange their privacy for the conveniences of the Internet and its processes? All of this is happening in the name of progress. Perhaps the myth of progress has become a religion that promises salvation from the forces of evil; and if it is, then we need to be very cautious of how we use it in our social justice education.An ecological paradigm involves a reversal in how language functions within the Enlightenment paradigm where print-based and thus abstract vocabularies influence both awareness and interpretations of the ecologies of the behaviors and communications encountered in daily life. The abstract vocabulary that represented traditions as backward, women as conceptually limited, autonomous individuals as original thinkers, and now data as objective, has led to ignoring the complexity of people’s lives that did not fit with the stereotypes of a print-based abstract world.The lack of an adequate vocabulary to describe how all forms of life are dependent upon robust natural systems — like the lack of adequate vocabulary to describe how women were being repressed — led even well-intentioned social justice reformers of earlier eras to ignore the biases encoded in the language that framed their awareness, and what that language ignored. To make the point more directly: academics across disciplines have taken for granted the core Enlightenment assumptions; this led them to fall behind on recognizing gender bias, and now they are behind on recognizing the threat of the digital revolution to our civil liberties and to the cultural commons that represent community-centered lifestyles that have a smaller ecological footprint. Language can mask important dynamics, and the Enlightenment’s obsession with language, particularly its own language, is steering reformers off course.Educators need to introduce students to how emergent, relational, and co-dependent patterns in natural and cultural ecologies can lead to the reframing of words. In the same way print-based Enlightenment influenced thinkers took for granted the autonomous nature of a single plant or piece of data, they took for granted the autonomous static nature of ideas such as freedom, free markets, and property; and in doing so they took fictions and imagined them into facts. This stands in opposition to the thinking of someone like Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist and deep ecological thinker. He explains that the truth that every aspect of the life world is emergent, relational, and co-dependent, is overlooked when we focus on a word. For example, when we see the word “flower” we imagine a separate autonomous entity, but this is a confusion inherited from the misconceptions of our past. The truth is that “nothing can exist by itself alone:”Looking deeply into a flower, we see that the flower is made of non-flower elements. There is nothing that is not present in the flower. We see sunshine, we see rain, we see clouds, we see the earth, and we also see time and space in the flower. A flower, like everything else, is made entirely of non-flower elements. The whole cosmos has come together in order to help the flower manifest herself. The flower is full of everything except one thing: a separate self, a separate identity (2002, 47–48).All aspects of both natural and cultural ecologies can be described in the same way.The use of a metaphorical language with meaning framed by the analogs settled on in the past and passed forward as the taken for granted way of thinking (i.e. the ideas of progress and emancipation from traditions, the objective nature of data, the ecological crisis, and so forth) would all be understood differently if our language were informed by an awareness of relationships — and the observation that each of the relationships also has a history that continues to influence the present and even the future. The use of nouns hides the emergent, relational and co-dependent nature ecological world within which we live. The ignoring of the history of words such as data, intelligence, progress, God, I, property, globalization, and so forth, contributes to the misrepresentation of the living world by focusing us on nouns and not on interconnected relationships.The intellectual mistakes of our Enlightenment based vocabulary are clear: the fixation on the written word makes us believe things are autonomous and separate; we even see ourselves as separate from the traditions and histories that birthed us; and we think of progress and freedom as becoming more separate from naive traditions of the past. Disregard for interconnectedness and tradition has come to dominate our social justice vocabularies as well. In order to address the cultural and linguistic roots of the ecological crises we need to change the way think, and to do that we need to change the way we teach.The following four areas represent the starting points for curriculum reform. They all need to be expanded as different ethnic groups begin to assess which of their traditions will contribute to slowing the rate of environmental degradation and which have been imposed on them by the colonizing efforts of the West.Classroom teachers can begin to overcome the the West’s vision of isolated entities by presenting an ontology of relationship, emergence, and interdependence. This paradigm shift can be incorporated in many settings beginning even with students in the early grades. Teachers can lead students to consider the experiential differences between the printed and spoken word; between sharing a meal with their family and friends and eating in front of the television; between face to face conversations with friends and communicating through an iPad or cell phone; between caring for a garden and purchasing industrial processed food; between learning a skill from a mentor in one of the arts and studying YouTube clips. Then teachers can have students compare their reflections on these questions with one another.Learning to give explicit attention to the emergent, relational, and interdependent patterns that connect in these examples exercises ecological intelligence. There is an added hurdle because learning to think relationally is undermined by other taken-for-granted patterns in culture such as the notion that there is a “right answer” that can be found by constructing an idea within the solitude of one’s own head (thereby reinforcing the myth of the self as an autonomous individual thinking about the external world in terms of discrete parts). It will be necessary for teachers to pose questions that prompt students to consider aspects of their taken for granted experience and challenge assumptions about what truly constitutes learning.Promoting relational thinking in the later grades can involve a wider range of examples that integrate more complex thinking: students can measure the environmental impact of hundreds of thousands of people driving to see their favorite football team; reflect on the relationship between the history of scientific achievements and the growing number of prominent scientists now engaging in scientism; debate about who benefits from reducing people’s experience to data and from the growth of surveillance technologies; research how the use of printed maps and treaties were use as colonizing technologies; investigate how the industrial system of production, digital technologies, automation influence cultural change, unemployment, and political extremism; study how online consumerism leads to the use of more delivery trucks and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; and provide reports on how the idea that progress and technologies are both inherently positive force coexists at the same time as the notion they are culturally neutral. All these examples could be projects or units in high school classes that weave threads between disciplines while engaging students in the realities of the contemporary moment.Relational thinking needs to be promoted by using examples from the different cultures represented in the classroom itself. Students can reflect on the ways in which they rely on the internet and how that impacts intergenerational communication; examine the relationships between racial differences, levels of unemployment, prison populations, the privatization of the prison systems, and the history of racism in America; compare how culture impacts their understanding of wealth; reflect on their relative reliance on the money economy; and consider how minority cultural groups are now represented on television as driven by the same pursuit of fun, silliness, and consumerism as the members of the dominant white culture. Teaching around these issues will draw students’ attention to the ways culture and history impact how they exist in the world.Making relational thinking a part of the curriculum can focus on the mundane, on what students want to explore, and even on the deeply important cultural issues and relationships that may not have occurred to students as affecting their future well-being. As prior socialization to the autonomous world of things and stand-alone entities reinforced by the noun dominated nature of the English language still dominates most students’ taken for granted world, it is necessary to continually remind students that thinking relationally is part of learning to exercise ecological intelligence — of learning to recognize the patterns that connect within the emergent, relational, and co-dependent worlds of the cultural and natural ecologies that their futures depend upon.Students need to understand more about how language is impacting their thought if they are going to free themselves from the insidious effects of their inherited vocabulary. Teaching should focus on three dynamics that provide insight into how ontology and language impact power relationships and are leveraged as ecological and colonizing forces: (1) the failure to understand the metaphorical nature of our largely taken for granted vocabularies; (2) how print and data (for all of their important uses), reinforce abstract thinking that undermines the exercise of ecological intelligence; and (3) how face-to-face intergenerational communication is essential to revitalizing the cultural commons.Understanding the metaphorical nature of language is especially important to becoming aware of how taken-for-granted vocabularies carry forward the misconceptions and silences that are at the root of so many of the ecological and social justice problems we now face. The question for many Americans, including classroom teachers and university professors to wrestle with is this: how have the misconceptions that fail to represent all living systems as relational, emergent, and as networks of information exchanges embedded itself in the words that express our own ideas and that represent the nature of the external world of facts and objective knowledge?Though it may seem pedantic, we need to take seriously what seems like an absurd and difficult to understanding explanation of the metaphorical nature of our taken for granted vocabularies. Understanding why Niezsche got it right and George Lakoff and Mark Johnson got it wrong will give all of us more ability to craft the understandings required to achieve environmental justice. By understanding that the basis of the meaning of language lies in metaphor, we can reclaim the power to creatively reimagine our language.Popular social justice discourse often points out that the meaning of certain words such as “woman” were framed by reference points settled upon by influential thinkers in the past who were themselves carrying forward the misconceptions and silences of their era. But we rarely discuss how this is the process by which all language gets it meaning, and that every speaker is an active participant in the process. If we made a deep inquiry into language a part of our curriculum learners might notice that many apparently neutral words carry tremendous cultural baggage. The analogs that framed the meaning of the word progress, turning it into a universal myth, were derived from the advances in print, from the early stages of modern science, and more efficient and profitable technologies that became the analogs for the mechanistic interpretative framework (root metaphor) for understanding even organic processes — including the human brain.The taken for granted meaning of most of our vocabulary ranging from “civilization”,” “tradition”,” “primitive”,” “individualism”,” “data”,” “work”,” “poverty,” “mankind”,” “God,” “science,” “technology,” , and so forth, were framed by the analogs settled upon in the past — and reproduced through generations as new members of the language community relied upon the meanings they inherited. That the analogs that frame the meanings of the vocabulary can be changed is usually not explained, even though social change continues to introduce different analogs that highlight what is problematic about the old analogs. This leaves the majority of people in the language community not empowered to participate actively in the meaning creation process.This way of thinking about language is really just a specific site of relational thinking, albeit a very important one. Relational thinking about language can be made explicit as part of helping students examine the nature of the analogs that frame the meaning of words they would otherwise not reflect upon. The political nature of the accepted metaphorically encoded vocabulary can be seen in how different words privilege certain groups over others; as is now being recognized in terms of gender, ethnic, and racial differences. Relational thinking is also involved in examining how the taken for granted vocabularies of neoliberals and libertarians, prevent them from recognizing that there is an ecological crisis and that it is leading to a catastrophic endgame. Exploring how the use of nouns both serves to hide the metaphorical nature of most words but also marginalizes awareness that life forming, sustaining, and destroying processes are emergent, relational, and interdependent, will lead to other important insights.The taken-for-granted view of print-based cultural storage and communication, which is now being replicated in how the authority of data is being understood, has been focused on the positive contributions of these Janus-faced technologies. How they reproduce both the Enlightenment view of individual intelligence and reinforce the tradition of abstract thinking that undermines an awareness of our complex world is less recognized. As the benefits are well understood, the focus here will be on what has generally been ignored.Students need to discuss how print and data undermine the exercise of ecological intelligence that will enable people to recognize how to live less consumer and environmentally exploitive lifestyles. They will also be well served by a deep ethnographically informed examination of what aspects of their own experience cannot be fully represented in print and by data.Focusing on the impermanent and interconnected nature of the world gives the lie to the notion that fixed and autonomous entities characterize life forming and sustaining processes, and thereby helps us witness the limitations of print and data that often go overlooked. Print and data enable an abstract understanding which includes the following limitations: (a) a surface knowledge that lacks depth in representing local ecological contexts; (b) they represent a mere snapshot of the flow of experience (which can be tested by obtaining a printed account of a crashing wave or an ongoing conversation); (c) what is committed to print, even when used by a gifted writer, too often takes on a life of its own and becomes reified as a universal, which can be seen the abstract theories of Western philosophers and social theorists; (d) the abstract thinking reinforced by print and data-based accounts is inherently ethnocentric and it ignores the emergent, relational, and semiotically complex networks of communication taken into account in oral cultures. (That is, face to face communication often involves historical memory, awareness of what is being communicated by the Other, critical thought, awareness of traditions, and even empathy); (e) what is committed to print and represented as data encodes the taken for granted assumptions, cultural frame works, and silences acquired earlier in the writer’s and data collector’s process of primary socialization to thinking in the language handed down from the past; (f) because of the limitations accompanying the use of print and data, and the cultural tradition of thinking of language as part of a conduit, that is, a sender/receiver process of communication, both the printed word and data are too often assumed to represent objective facts, information, and data; (g) the lack of understanding that the taken for granted meaning of most words were framed by the analogs settled upon in earlier times, along with the cultural convention of writing as a third person observer, leads to the widespread failure to recognize that what is written is always an interpretation, and the reader’s relationship to what is written or represented as data is also an interpretation based the taken for granted thinking of earlier generations; (h) the abstract thinking reinforced by print and data leads to unequal power relationships, especially in light of other cultural baggage such as the assumption that print is evidence of a civilization’s superior rationality and advancement from oral based culture. (this can be seen in how the use of maps, printed treaties, and the use of Western metaphors established ownership of the lands of indigenous cultures).Ecologically sustainable community-centered lifestyles also represent zones of safety from the predatory practices of the hackers, scammers, and surveillance systems that now exist throughout the world. They are called the cultural commons that enable people to be less dependent upon money economies and industrial systems of production and consumerism that are based on the myth of unending progress. The intergenerational knowledge and skills (i.e. traditions) passed forward — primarily in face to face and in mentoring relationships — cover the entire range of cultural activities: from the growing and preparation of food, to ceremonies, the arts that range from music, dance, poetry, traditions of social justice, mentoring in the how to exercise ecological intelligence, vocabularies, games, craft knowledge of how to work with wood, clay, stone, and metal to how to read what is being communicated between the natural and cultural ecological systems.Learning, through careful observation, how talents and skills are nourished within the community, how acquiring the skills connected with different cultural commons activities, and how cultural commons activities involve patterns of mutual support, should be a central focus of curriculum reform. The curriculum should encourage students to consider why cultural commons activities are less environmentally destructive than consumerism, and how they lead to being less dependent upon a money economy that will become increasingly restricted as digital technologies and the combination of market liberalism and Enlightenment ideology replace more workers with robots and algorithms. There should also be an in-depth discussion of the relational and co-dependent nature of how the cultural commons conserves traditions of local decision making, enabling people to be less vulnerable to digital technologies that put their security at risk — including their moral narratives central to their sense of cultural identity. Wealth in the cultural commons is understood as the talents and skills that contribute to the wellbeing of others. Unlike the wealth that is measured in money, wealth of the cultural commons is largely immune from being hacked.The curriculum should also introduce students to how the ideology of market liberalism/libertarianism continues to undermine what remains of the cultural commons of different cultures, as well as how according high status to print and digital based knowledge serves to undermine the cultural commons. This is where the earlier discussion of how the vocabulary that supports the myth of progress needs to be reintroduced as part of the discussion of why so many people are unable to recognize that the traditions of today’s cultural commons represent alternatives to the industrial/market driven/consumer-dependent culture that is leading the world to the endgame of collapsing natural systems. This discussion should also introduce students to the many groups and movements that go by different names, such as the Transition Communities in the southwest of England, the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies, and the global spread of the Localism Movement described in the following way: http://www.localfutures.org/wp-content/uploads/climate-action-paper.pdf.In addition to making different aspects of the cultural commons the focus of ethnographic studies of the community, and exploring issues related to the health of cultural commons activists — as well as their satisfaction of living lives characterized by voluntary simplicity — students need to experience the difference between engaging in cultural commons activity and a similar activity that involves a consumer relationship. What are the basic differences in terms of discovering a personal talent and developing the skills that reduce dependency upon consumerism? Many students are already involved in the creative arts, in helping others in the community, and in social justice activism — including environmental restoration projects. Their insights about the experiential differences between learning a skill and participating with others in largely non-monetized activities will help bring out what is ecologically sustainable about the cultural commons.",,C.

RESIDENTIAL CHANGE AND ADJUSTMENT IN THE LATER YEARS A 20-year collaborative, longitudinal study will shed light on what it's like to grow old in various residential settings, how older people decide to move, how they adjust to housing changes, and ways to promote life quality in different types of housing. Perhaps dad can no longer mow the lawn or shovel the driveway. Or mom breaks her hip in a bathtub fall. It's time for them to decide, Where do we go, now that we can no longer live in our home? Or their adult children face the question, What do we do with our parents now that they can no longer live alone? As older people age, their health as well as their other needs change so that the home they've lived in for a long time may no longer be appropriate, says John Krout, director of Ithaca College's Gerontology Institute. Some older people, because of their disposition or income or other factors, don't think very far ahead when it comes to planning for appropriate housing. The burden can fall to their children. Phyllis Moen, director of the College of Human Ecology's Bronfenbrenner Life Course Center, sees this late life transition as an interplay between chance and choice. Compared with other life stages, the risks and the options are very clear, she explains. we see in some people a tremendous avoidance of decision making while others are great planners. Apart from health, housing is the single most critical determinant of an older person's independence. Yet it has heretofore been relegated to the private sphere, an issue that people either deal with or avoid on their own. In truth, it is a public issue of increasing importance as we anticipate the older population doubling over the next 30 years, says Moen, the Ferris Family Professor of Life Course Studies. With little comprehensive, long-term research available on the dynamics of voluntary residential change to guide families, policy makers, and the housing industry, Moen and Krout set out to fill that gap. The result is Pathways to Life Quality: A Long-Term Study of Residential Change and Adjustment in the Later Years, for which they are the co-principal investigators. The Pathways study is the first multidisciplinary research project to bring together the expertise of faculty from both Cornell and Ithaca College. With a $1.57 million grant, the project is now in the first five-year segment of its anticipated twenty-year duration. The study's findings will shed light on three main areas: what it's like to grow old in various residential settings, from one's own home to a continuing care community; how people make decisions about how and when to move and how they adjust to changes from one type of housing to another; and ways to reduce health care costs and promote life quality within and across different types of housing. The breadth and depth of information to be collected in the study reflects the research expertise of the fourteen participating faculty members, seven from each institution. Human Ecology collaborators will look at, among other things, how aging influences perceived life quality and well-being; intergenerational relationships, including ways parents give and take help from their children; and financial considerations, such as the use of reverse mortgages. The Ithaca College faculty, including researchers in the School of Health Sciences and Human Performance, bring expertise in occupational and physical therapies as well as psychology, sociology, and marketing. For the researchers involved in the Pathways study, housing is not just bricks and mortar; rather, the term is used to encompass the physical and social space in which the elderly spend most of their lives. Beyond being merely a dwelling situated in a neighborhood, housing affords ready access to (or isolates people from) companionship, intellectual stimulation, and care - both personal and medical. …",,,false,,false,,

transition path and due to new discretionary measure, may differently affect retirement behaviours, with
significant economic consequences in the short run on income distribution and poverty as well as on the long run
on wealth from pension and labour. In this paper we present new evidence on the effect of the recent seniority
pension reform, considering the evolution using a dynamic aging approach. Our dynamic microsimulation model
- calibrated to replicate the main demographic and economic features and retirement dynamics of the Italian
economy - is used to examine behavioural changes along proposed pension reform paths.
In particular, we compare, under two �retirement behavioural rules� (individual and family-bounded rationality),
how changes in the current transition path (B) due to the recent seniority pensions reform (M) can affect the
trend of inequality and poverty among pensioners and the distribution of human capital (the distribution of
wealth from actual wages and expected pensions) analyse intragenerational and intergenerational issues.
The impact of policy M may slow down the increase in income concentration and poverty, due to the transition
to the defined contribution regime. In particular, the rise of the legal age seems to be particularly effective under
family bounded rationality since it forces workers (especially females) to postpone retirement, rising in this way
their pension annuity.",,,false,,false,,

Additionally, populations in Africa have been affected by a high burden of infectious diseases, including HIV.

Predictions of NCD prevalence in Africa have generally been modelled under the assumptions either that the rise in NCDs will reflect trends in urbanisation and demographics (producing conservative estimates), or that it will follow past trends in NCD prevalance.7Bollyky TJ Templin T Cohen M Dieleman JL Lower-income countries that face the most rapid shift in noncommunicable disease burden are also the least prepared.Health Aff (Millwood). 2017; 36: 1866-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar A problem is that past trends data only capture recent history,8Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 CollaboratorsGlobal, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.Lancet. 2015; 386: 743-800Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4472) Google Scholar perhaps before the effects of malnutrition and infectious disease exposure in early life have manifested, and before widespread exposure to overnutrition has occurred. These predictions might be accurate, but they could also be gross underestimates. If countries in Africa are to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals targets 3.4 and 3.8, to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by a third and to achieve universal health coverage, more information on the interaction between malnutrition, infectious diseases, and later-life NCDs is urgently needed. To address gaps in knowledge and policy, we formed the Africa Chapter of the DOHaD Society, with support from the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study (STIAS) and the African Academy of Sciences. The broad rationale for the Chapter is fourfold: first, to highlight the massive effects that early-life exposures will have on future burden of disease; second, to emphasise the dearth of knowledge around this subject and advocate for research funding to address this gap; third, to form a network of African scientists and collaborators from elsewhere to develop and study research questions relevant to DOHaD; and fourth, to build local capacity by encouraging and supporting young scientists in DOHaD-related research. Importantly, a key mission of the Africa Chapter is to highlight the need for urgent policy action to implement public health solutions that are transferrable from other contexts. In this regard, South Africa is leading the way with the introduction of a sugar-sweetened beverage tax.9Economics Tax Analysis Chief DirectorateTaxation of Sugar Sweetened Beverages. National Treasury, Republic of South AfricaJuly 8, 2017Google Scholar Such policies need to be enacted in many more African countries, but there are other initiatives that could potentially be scaled up to ensure that future generations' early life and subsequent exposures are more favourable. Ensuring an optimal maternal environment during pregnancy is crucial for reducing deleterious early-life exposures. However, to achieve this optimal maternal environment, interventions should also be targeted to other life stages. In particular, we believe that children represent an important and currently undertargeted population. Because knowledge and behaviours learned in adolescence influence lifestyle choices in adult life,10Viner RM Ozer EM Denny S et al.Adolescence and the social determinants of health.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1641-1652Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar investment in young people's formal and informal education targets those at a key age point in the DOHaD trajectory. But just as there is little understanding of NCD trajectories, our understanding of how to provide messages that affect young people is also poor.1Atun R Davies JI Gale EAM et al.Diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa: from clinical care to health policy.Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2017; 5: 622-667Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar Given the strong association between childhood body-mass index and later-life obesity and type 2 diabetes, and the subsequent adverse effects of these diseases on future generations' health, we desperately need to understand how to communicate more effectively with children.

Our main recommendation is that we need to act now and we need to collaborate multisectorally if we are to temper the epidemic of NCDs in Africa.PanelKey priorities for research and policy change•Discover the attributable effects of early-life exposures on later life NCD burden in Africa•Ascertain how a DOHaD framework can aid achievement of the sustainable development goals•Assess the best strategies to improve maternal health during pregnancy•Test solutions for optimising child and adolescent health•Increase awareness of DOHaD across Africa.•Ensure multisectoral collaboration to address DOHaD across governments, industry, civil society, and academia.•Advocate for innovation and funding agencies to include DOHaD in Africa in their calls for proposals•Use, and study the results of, fiscal policies to promote healthy living at all ages•Foster a new generation of young African scientists to address DOHaD research questions •Discover the attributable effects of early-life exposures on later life NCD burden in Africa•Ascertain how a DOHaD framework can aid achievement of the sustainable development goals•Assess the best strategies to improve maternal health during pregnancy•Test solutions for optimising child and adolescent health•Increase awareness of DOHaD across Africa.•Ensure multisectoral collaboration to address DOHaD across governments, industry, civil society, and academia.•Advocate for innovation and funding agencies to include DOHaD in Africa in their calls for proposals•Use, and study the results of, fiscal policies to promote healthy living at all ages•Foster a new generation of young African scientists to address DOHaD research questions We declare no competing interests.",,J.

With Brexit, for once this is not hyperbole. It represents the most significant moment of political choice and potential rupture since the Second World War, and in peacetime, possibly since the repeal of the Corn Laws in the nineteenth century. For four decades, membership of the European Union (EU) and its predecessors has shaped the evolution of Britain's model of democratic capitalism. It has anchored the UK's economic policy framework, governed the UK's trade, restructured British manufacturing and its supply chains and helped attract foreign direct investment into the country. The City of London has been transformed since the 1970s to serve EU as well as global markets. European companies now supply many of Britain's utility needs, from energy to rail and bus transport. EU membership is even built into our hard infrastructure, most obviously through the Channel Tunnel. The supply of migrant labour from the EU, particularly since 2004, has greatly altered the UK's workforce, transforming a number of sectors like retail, hospitality, care and food processing. Other industries like agriculture and fisheries have been fundamentally reshaped by common EU policies. The impact of the EU extends far beyond economics, however. British society has a different make-up and look and feel due to EU membership. The population, and the places in which it lives and works, has become more European. Several generations’ horizons, sense of mobility and travel patterns have been greatly broadened. Social and environmental policies, from annual holiday rights to clean beaches, have rested on EU initiatives. The UK's place in the world and foreign policy has been moulded and moderated by our membership. Our legal system, and the very form of statecraft pursued by the British state, has been transformed. It is no exaggeration to say that the European project has re-made us. Yet to present this simply as a story of disruption and transformation would be to mislead. There are deep continuities too. There is a UK ‘pre-history’ to EU membership that has also endured, not least in our political economy, much of which is rooted in the Victorian era. The UK is a liberal market economy with a global financial sector, deregulated labour market, shareholder dominated corporate governance, and an education system with a strong bias against vocational skills in favour of generic ones. Entry to the ‘Common Market’ in 1973 helped cement the structures of this British liberal market economy, rather than fundamentally reforming it along coordinated or social market European lines. The UK did not leave its economic past behind when it joined the European project. The role of the state in the economy was significantly reduced as well as reformed in the 1980s, and the postwar growth model of an export-orientated national economy with significant domestic manufacturing, energy and food production was progressively dismantled.1 But the underlying institutions of the UK liberal market economy remained in large part intact throughout these transformations. They evolved in tandem with a political system dominated by two main parties and a liberal welfare regime of mostly flat rate benefits and significant means-testing, rather than the multi-party politics of proportional voting systems, and social insurance or universalist models of welfare found in Northern Europe.2 As it entered the new millennium, the UK was an open, financialised economy, deeply integrated into European markets, with a growth model underpinned by consumption and an oversized housing sector. High value service exports and foreign direct investment helped to offset a persistent deficit in manufactured goods. To be sure, this growth model had formidable strengths: competitive advantages in knowledge-based sectors; a buoyant labour market, drawing in highly skilled migrants; and productivity gains driven by leading edge service companies and world class universities and research. But these were matched by chronic failings: weak investment; entrenched inequalities between people, places and generations; a dystopian housing market; and rampant insecurity in segments of the jobs market, among others. When the UK was battered by the financial crisis in 2008, it exposed economic fault-lines that had been obscured by the long era of benign growth in the 1990s and 2000s. They became even more visible, and acquired greater public consciousness, following the Brexit referendum. Despite the gains made before the crisis, levels of UK productivity remained comparatively low and, remarkably, have now barely improved for a decade. Real wages are still significantly below pre-crisis levels. And longstanding inequalities of income and wealth, between both the regions of the UK and its social classes, show little sign of diminishing. As a nation, the UK continues to rely, in the words of the governor of the Bank of England, on ‘the kindness of strangers’ to pay its way in the world. A new and darker global context also overshadows the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. The protectionist, America First agenda of Donald Trump reverses seventy years of US commitment to an integrated Europe and has already engendered geo-political division over tariffs, the role of NATO, and the EU's relationships with Russia and Iran. In tandem with this we've witnessed the rise of nationalist and neo-fascist parties, both within the EU and outside it, who share a common hostility to internationalism at a time when the looming crisis of climate breakdown demands urgent global action. Brexit arises at a moment when the postwar institutions of the international community are under huge stress. At the level of domestic policymaking, withdrawal from the EU presents a series of discrete challenges, such as how to handle a range of repatriated powers. Each policy area is important. But if our analysis is narrow, focussing on a set of single issues, we risk missing the bigger shifts. Hence, in this book, we address Brexit in the context of the impending challenges of the 2020s and beyond. We situate the question of leaving the EU and what it means in the larger sweep of the outlook for democratic welfare capitalism in the UK. The leading contributors to this special volume range widely across politics, economics, social policy and democratic and constitutional reform, while the book as a whole seeks to connect the domestic situation of the UK with its external position, both economic and geo-political. At the time of writing (January 2019), the politics of Brexit remain radically uncertain. A number of scenarios—Theresa May's proposed deal, leaving the EU without a deal, a soft Brexit, an agreed extension of the Article 50 process, or a second referendum with the option of remaining in the EU—are all still possible. For the most part, the contributions to this book are predicated on some form of withdrawal from the EU taking place in the years ahead. But beyond that, the scope for analysis and interpretation remains very wide, and the chapters consequently contain diverse perspectives on what has caused the Brexit rupture in British politics, and what its consequences might be. To make sense of the vote to leave the EU, we need to unpack both the moment in history in which it occurred, as well as the coalitions who supported it. The timing of the vote was inauspicious from a Remain perspective. Not only did it take place amid the worst decade of pay growth since the Napoleonic wars, the deepest austerity in modern times and in the shadow of the eurozone crisis. It also occurred when broadly eurosceptic baby boomers were at their electoral peak, while the more pro-European ‘silent generation’ of the war years was in steady decline, and their younger more Remain-minded cohorts were yet to reach their full electoral potency. Economically, as well as electorally, it represented a truly reckless moment for a Remain-supporting Prime Minister to seek to settle the European question. But whatever the timing, the referendum fundamentally pivoted around the creation of an alliance of older, conservative middle class voters and the semi-skilled and unskilled working class—a combination of what David Willets has called ‘the insulated and the excluded’.3 Political discourse about the referendum has been dominated by the plight of so-called ‘left behind’ voters. Yet in reality, older, relatively prosperous voters were just as significant in number, reflecting the UK's marked inequalities in voter turnout by age. The referendum result, therefore, represented a reckoning with places that have never recovered from the shock of de-industrialisation and Thatcherism, as well as groups who have not been reconciled with the ascendance of ever greater social liberalism and the cosmopolitan remaking of Britain, or the European remaking of the British state. For those reasons, the outcome of the vote is difficult to explain in terms of the dominant political economic interests in the productive economy. The City of London, the major business organisations and the trade unions all supported Remain, as did the main political parties. The Leave vote disproportionately came from interests outside the labour market—older voters with a foundation of housing and pension wealth, or the state pension and pensioner benefits—and those struggling precariously within it, like the low skilled and self-employed. Its campaign was led by a political and economic elite—even if it was an unconventional one, drawn from beyond the organised pillars of the economy—but it successfully channelled an eruption of politics against the established political economy. It shook to its core the world-view that the big contours of the UK's economic policy were firmly set and resided outside the reach of democratic contest. And it forced attention—if not public policy—upon an economic trajectory that had so unevenly distributed the gains of growth over the last four decades. Other drivers of the referendum vote are perhaps easier to grasp. The young and middle aged, and the better educated, were far more inclined to vote Remain. These are the social groups most comfortable with immigration and the diversity of modern Britain. The geography of the referendum reflected this, pitting most of the major urban centres and university cities against the towns, countryside and coastlines. Majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted Remain, while most of England and Wales opted to Leave. This political geography is new: in 1975, none of the UK's constituent nations voted ‘No’ to EEC membership, and England and Wales recorded the largest supporting majorities. While these headline territorial patterns are striking, consideration needs to be given to differences within regions and how they interact with the effects of age. Look, for instance, at retired voters in a strongly ‘Remain’ region like London and we see that they backed Leave in similar proportions to the retired of Yorkshire, the north-west or Wales. Equally, if we just consider those in work, we see that Remain won in more nations and regions of the UK than Leave. Brexit has certainly fractured the electorate in important ways, but it is a far more complicated picture than London, Scotland and Northern Ireland versus the rest of England and Wales. The Brexit juncture comes in a new era of UK politics. It marks the first real crisis of politics in the post-devolution era in which the UK has become formed as a multi-national state, not just in terms of its governance, but in its identity too. Formal decisions concerning Brexit reside with the Westminster Parliament, but the consequences ripple across the UK's nations and their assemblies, parliaments and civil societies. The European question has layered another deep cleavage onto the already fractious territorial politics of the union. Over the last forty years, Britain has sought consistently to entrench its liberal market model within the EU, pursuing the creation and completion of the single market, while (for the most part) resisting Delorsian ambitions to embed European capitalism in a pan-European social democracy. Its period of membership may have often been grudging, but it has also been consequential. The decision to leave the European project can therefore be expected to alter the future trajectory of the EU. But what might it mean for the future political economy of the UK? Will it essentially be a story of continuity or should we see dislocation? Will it be the same but worse, or is this the start of something very different? When it comes to the UK's growth model, it is hard to see where a significant re-orientation will come from. The major devaluations of sterling over recent years (one following the 2008 crisis, the other after the Brexit vote) have not spurred export growth but have reduced real wages. If nothing else, they have exposed the contemporary hollowness of the age-old hope that a weaker currency will prove to be an elixir for British manufacturing. A surge in export-led growth in the years ahead seems highly unlikely: if the UK ends up outside the single market and customs union, there will inevitably be new frictions in trade with Britain's biggest market, while any new trade deals with other countries will be time consuming, involve sharp trade-offs and are likely to generate only negligible gains in GDP compared to the expected losses arising from diminished access to the EU. Financial services, on which the UK relies heavily for export performance, are likely to shift a significant proportion of business to the EU. Gravity is not so easy to defy. A new era of wage-driven growth feels unrealistic too. Even now, at a mature stage of the economic cycle and in the face of a tight jobs market, pay rises remain anaemic by postwar standards. Without a turnaround in productivity, wage growth will remain weak, as will household income growth, all of which is a major constraint on the consumption-led UK growth model.4 Business investment, too, is not well placed to come to the rescue. The UK's long-running problem of weak investment has, if anything, intensified in the post-crisis era and now Brexit uncertainty represents a major additional drag on business sentiment. Public investment is increasing substantially, but not at a rate sufficient to transform the overall outlook. The engines of demand in the UK economy have been slow to recover since the financial crisis and have been further weakened by the prospect of Brexit. This will place more strain on macro-economic policy. It is unlikely the UK will return to anything like ‘normal’ monetary policy in the immediate future. Fiscal pressures are set to ease relative to the deep austerity of recent years, but this is only likely to mean that spending keeps up with inflation rather than recovering any of the ground lost after 2010. And history suggests that before too long—even leaving aside any disruptive shocks—we should anticipate another recession or slow-down. A new phase of policy activism may well be needed before the last phase has been wound down. Between 1997 and 2010, New Labour pursued a social investment strategy: fleshing out the UK's liberal welfare state with new spending on tax credits, childcare, investment in education and skills, and a major expansion of higher education. Poverty fell, inequality levelled off and income mobility rose. These were major social achievements, though for many post-industrial towns and cities, they never amounted to the creation of a viable new economic future. What appeared for a while to be a durable electoral coalition of the working class and middle class socio-cultural professionals underpinned this policy shift, but has since fragmented. This period of growth in our welfare state was followed by sharp retrenchment after 2010, with deep cuts in support for those of working age and a pronounced reshaping of spending in favour of pensioners. By the time the Brexit referendum took place in 2016, public opinion had already begun to turn against further cuts to social security—a trend that is likely to continue in the years ahead—rendering the politics of ‘welfare savings’ ever more intractable.5 The fiscal pressures on the welfare state will only grow. All ageing societies like the UK face significant challenges financing their welfare states, particularly because of rising health, social care and pension costs. This shrinks the space for fiscal generosity and sharpens trade-offs between the welfare preferences of different sections of the electorate. The UK has already aggressively pursued the ‘orthodox’ repertoire of strategies for mitigating long-term fiscal pressures of ageing on the welfare state: migration has grown, the employment rate is at a record high, punitive working-age welfare conditionality has been imposed, and the state pension age has been hiked. On each score the limits have been reached. Any version of Brexit will serve to intensify these fiscal constraints, not only because of the damage done to tax revenues, but also because of additional pressures on spending. Since the referendum, there have been repeated calls from across the spectrum for increased spending to respond to the popular demand for change, and shore up Britain's domestic and international frailties: we've seen this on issues ranging from industrial and regional policy, to training, housing, farming and defence. There is little sign that Brexit points towards a smaller state. All told, the Brexit penumbra will make the already difficult politics of moving to a sustainable twenty-first century welfare settlement far harder. The postwar welfare expansion was funded on the back of major switches in spending priorities, historic broadening of the tax base and a prolonged era of productivity growth. Any post-Brexit welfare adjustment will have to put more of the strain onto higher taxes. There will, however, be clear limits to the tax rises that a wage-squeezed public will bear. Ultimately, the future of the welfare state—and the social contact that depends on it—will require a rekindling of productivity growth. If our liberal market economy cannot achieve this, then political pressure will grow for the state to pursue far more dirigiste strategies. These will have to encompass the ‘everyday’ or ‘foundational’ economy of private sector and publicly procured low wage service jobs in which millions of British workers are employed, not just the leading edge of high valued export sectors that industrial strategy typically embraces.6 The marked age divide in British politics that has emerged in recent decades acted as a midwife to the Brexit vote and was consolidated at the 2017 general election. Age has not ended the importance of social class, nor have voters’ ‘values’ become somehow detached from any relation to their material circumstances or the wider institutions of the economy. But it is certainly true that navigating the demographic schism has become the sine qua non of political management in the UK. If the Brexit cleavage remains central to British politics in the decades ahead—and ‘Remain’ vs ‘Leave’ become entrenched in the long-term political identities of large swathes of the electorate—this will only serve to magnify existing intergenerational tensions. Political parties seeking paths to electoral majorities will need strategies—including public policies for tax and spend, and social cohesion—that can plausibly overcome or at least ameliorate these divisions and command cross-generational support. Population change will, of course, alter the make-up of the electorate over the long run. But recent experience from the UK, EU and US politics shows that demographic destinies can take a long time to arrive: in the meantime, politics can be contingently and rapidly reshaped as parties re-orient their strategies to meet electoral demands made by ‘declining’ or marginalised social groups.7 The playing out of the shift towards increased ethnic diversity will remain a feature of British society and its politics. On the one hand, public opinion since the referendum shows a marked weakening of hostility to immigration. And, more generally, Britain remains a relatively cohesive society compared to some European counterparts. However, levels of inward migration are likely to remain high in the future, albeit rebalanced away from the EU to the rest of the world because of the probable curtailment of free movement. And experience in much of the rest of Europe shows that discontent about migrants (and refugees) can quickly be channelled into support for far-right and nativist parties. Britain's majoritarian electoral system has insulated but not inoculated it from these strains of politics. One of the biggest questions of post-Brexit politics is whether this remains the case. Just as demography will remain a defining divide in post-Brexit politics, so too will territorial politics. One of the paradoxes of recent years is that the post-1998 institutions—the Good Friday Agreement and 1998 Scotland Act—have at a deep level shaped our constitution. Yet, surface level political debate (if not the substantive nature of the deal finally reached with the EU) has often proceeded as if we still inhabited some bygone era of unitary-state, Westminster-centric politics. This contradiction and its consequences—not just in terms of its impact on nationalist sentiment in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but also on the future trajectories of pro-union parties within each of our nations, in particular Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Labour party—will be one of Brexit's legacies. It is also possible—though difficult to predict—that the politics of Englishness, and the place of England in the union, will remerge as an important vector of politics in the UK once the intense focus on Brexit and the institutional form it takes diminishes. All of this will reverberate through our party system for decades to come. To date, much of the focus of political debate has been on whether there might be a formal realignment in our party system—either through a new centrist party or the emergence of an insurgent English nationalist alternative to UKIP that folds in a swath of Conservative Leave supporters, as well as some traditional Labour voters. Whether or not this party realignment comes to pass is moot: the hurdles to it are high in a majoritarian electoral system. Either way, the aftershocks of Brexit will continue to cause flux within and between the existing parties, not least because devolution and the proportional voting systems of the devolved parliaments and assemblies create space for political insurgency that can profoundly influence the major UK parties. Political identities have been shaken up, if not completely broken, by the Brexit convulsion. It will be years before they settle down and when they finally do, it will affect not just who voters trust and the issues they gravitate to, but the political coalitions they might join. The Leave vote was not simply an exercise in imperial nostalgia, as some have claimed. But, as we have shown, there are deep continuities between Britain's present and its past that will shape its future. The dominant role of the City in the UK economy and the liberal framework of its political economy have endured over decades, as has the nature of its welfare state. Even the newly emergent forces that are restructuring the institutions of the union and the relationships between its nations have deeper historical roots. But a political moment as large as Brexit will, without doubt, bring change too—some of it directly related to leaving the EU, but much of it rooted in other long-standing failings—whether on regional inequality, housing, or economic insecurity—that now have greater political potency. Add to this the newer societal challenges that any government has to face up to in the decades ahead: switching to low-carbon production and transportation systems, meeting the escalating care costs arising from ageing, and supporting the workforce to transition to longer working lives. And then consider the pent-up problems caused by the austerity decade that will trouble our public realm in the years ahead: councils and school-chains going bust, hospitals needing bailing out, demands for the Universal Credit roll out to be halted, and so on. In addition to these burdens on state capacity will be the return of EU responsibilities to the UK amid a period of uncertainty. Whether it is forging a new trade policy in a protectionist age, a competition policy fit for the era of big tech, or a migration framework suited to a greying society, the British state will be learning to read a new map in a fast shifting landscape. The confluence of these pre-existing pressures with the new and urgent imperatives of Brexit will put strains on the state that have not been experienced since at least the mid-1970s. It is hard not to see government becoming more involved in key aspects of our national economic life—certainly as a result of necessity, and possibly ideology too. Will, however, this greater involvement give rise to any fundamental shift in our political economy? In part, the answer will, of course, come down to political choice. No variety of democratic capitalism is immutable. For the first time in recent memory, the momentum in both main political parties simultaneously lies with those favouring radical economic rupture: whether through leaving the EU without a deal if necessary and pivoting towards a low tax, deregulated ‘Singapore of the West’ model; or restoring public ownership and state-financed and directed growth. The politics of the moment would suggest the British model is set for profound upheaval. Yet if there is a lesson from twentieth century history, it is that some core features of our political economy are hard to shift: they have survived multiple changes of government, world wars, contrasting philosophies of economic management and profound shifts in the structure of the global economy. Anyone assuming that the political tumult of Brexit will inevitably give rise to some fundamental re-ordering of our capitalist model—whether for good or ill—may well be waiting in vain. What is certainly true, however, is that the constellation of pressures facing the UK means that a key feature of the post-Brexit era will be learning to navigate vulnerability. In the macro-economy the UK will live with levels of public debt that are far higher than the recent norm for decades to come, at the same time as interest rates seem likely to sit close to the floor. Reduced policy space means the risk of greater exposure to shocks. A sense of heightened economic exposure will also be the norm for the British worker, and not just because of their weak bargaining position and the continued decline of unions. Workers are likely to remain exposed to the risk of further exchange rate devaluation—which, as recent years have shown, feeds through directly into lower real wages. The risk that mobile employers decide to uproot production and leave the UK, or downgrade their operations here, is also likely to be heightened for years to come. At the constitutional level too, precariousness will prevail. No one can know how Brexit will play out on the forces pushing for Scottish independence—though it is not unreasonable to think that the shock of a hard Brexit might set back the independence cause in the short to medium term, while strengthening it beyond that. Either way, the issue will remain at the fore, as will the status of Northern Ireland and, most probably, the governance of England within the union. Far fewer of these issues are settled than seemed the case just a few years ago. The governing challenge is not just the technical task of successfully negotiating these risks. If there are reasons to hope that the resilience and flexibility of the UK's economy will help it to adjust to life outside the EU, albeit with weaker rates of growth and less dynamism than in the past, the same may not be true of our politics. The political challenge of forging a coalition of electoral support that could undergird any sustainable governing programme is a profound one. As various contributions to this volume show, post-Brexit politics is likely to remain deeply divided along a number of connected fault-lines: generational, geographical and identity cleavages that cut across the support bases of the two main parties. Crafting a political agenda that spans these divides sufficiently to allow tough governing choices to be made would require remarkable leadership by the standards of any age, let alone one in which the main parties are so visibly struggling to rise to the level of events. Whatever the chain of events in the months and years ahead—a soft or hard Brexit, or remaining in the EU through a second referendum—there will be a legacy of rancour and bitterness that will be hard to contain within the existing party system, and which may even challenge the basic norms of conduct of democratic politics. And even if the UK does leave the EU, the European question will endure as a major vector of British politics, for as Switzerland and others have found, any country that is a close neighbour to a large and powerful bloc like the EU is likely to be in permanent negotiation with it.8 All the more so if, as seems highly likely, the UK remains a regulatory rule-taker in one form or another. Politics, more than economics, may be the UK's undoing. We should, however, exercise caution about the gloom. In the heat of a crisis, it is always tempting to foresee an age of continued tumult. That case is easily made in Brexit Britain. But there are also countervailing forces, too. The consequences of breaking trading ties with the EU are so dire that one way or another the UK will seek to navigate its way towards a relatively close relationship with it. The strengths that have given the British model momentum will hardly fade overnight, even if they now face great strain. Our high value services, world leading university sector, and job-rich labour market, all provide grounds for optimism. The British state has shown itself capable of strategic purpose and organisational ingenuity in the last century. And—however unfashionable it may be to point this out in the current moment—there remains a residual resilience in the democratic politics of the UK. Declinism is often overwrought and overstated in British public life—that, too, is a part of our tradition. But history suggests powerful new directions can be forged in public policy even in times of adversity. They have many times before, and no doubt will again.

The natural capital stock is modelled as a renewable resource. The change in the stock of natural capital depends on its autonomous evolution, production and consumption externalities, and environment maintenance programs. The economy is shown to be sustainable only if, for any marginal propensity to consume (MPC, the rate of taxation to maintain the environment exceeds a critical level, or equivalently, for any tax rate, the MPC is below a critical value. If human activities have a net beneficial effect on the environment, the economy will converge to a unique and stable steady state, which can be viewed as a generalized Solow-Swan balanced path. The condition for such a steady state to be sustainable is derived. In a sustainable steady state, the tax rate and MPC can be chosen to maximize per capita consumption. Introduction It is now generally acknowledged that the aggregate output of an economy and, hence, its economic development path, depend ultimately on how it make uses of its physical, human, social and environmental capital. The accumulation of physical capital as a determinant of economic growth features prominently in the Solow-Swan model (see Solow, 1956; Swan, 1956). This model provides simple testable propositions about how the exogeneously given rates of saving, population growth and technological innovation influence the steady-state level of per capita income More recently, Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) incorporated human capital into the textbook Solow-Swan model and demonstrated that the augmented model provides an excellent explanation of the international variation in the standard of living. In a separate development, economists have turned increasingly to endogenous-growth models which go beyond the Solow-Swan model to argue for externalities in the generation of both human capital and technological innovations, and for profit as the driving force behind innovation. Various strands of the endogenous growth literature, which dates back to the work of Uzawa (1965), are summarized in Romer (1994). Social capital, alternatively called social capabilities, is a more elusive concept, which does not render itself easily to formal analysis. It includes such factors as openness and competitiveness of the economy, institutional arrangements, secure property rights, honesty, trust and interpersonal networks. In short, social capital represents a set of any intangible things that reduce transaction costs and, thus, help markets operate more smoothly. The role of social capital as an input in the production process has been considered mainly by development economists in connection with developing or transitional economies (see, for example, Hasson and Henrekson, 1994). The natural capital stock refers to the totality of all ecosystems, which include, for example, water, soil, forest cover, the atmosphere, minerals, ores and fossil fuels. While a complete theory of the mining firm was first formulated by Hotelling (1931) more than sixty years ago, economists only began constructing general equilibrium models to accommodate resource exhaustibility in the early 1970s. This effort, triggered by the Report for the Club of Rome (see Meadows et al., 1972) and the oil shocks, has resulted in a substantial expansion of the literature on exhaustible resources (see, for example, Dasgupta and Heal, 1979; Kemp and Long, 1980). A large part of this vein of literature is concerned with the optimal depletion of nonrenewable resources. More recently, research on the environment has focused on biodiversity and renewable natural resources (see, for example, Pearce and Turner, 1990; Perrings, 1994; Dasgupta, 1996). The major theoretical issues in this new wave of literature include intergenerational incidence of costs and benefits, causes of environmental degradation, valuation of environmental resources, property rights and economic instruments, and international governance and the global commons. …",,,false,,false,,

are essential for our health and wellbeing.1 They represent one of seven domains considered in this supplement on the Future Healthy Countdown 2030. The Nest framework, developed by the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth, defined this domain in 2021 through interviews with children and young people.2 According to their collective voices, material basics include stable and suitable housing, nutritious food, and clean water and air.2 They also include necessary school supplies and technology, the ability to take part in social activities, and access to transport and open spaces.2 Material basics are met when families have enough money for all these needs and items.1, 2 Children who are raised in families experiencing material deprivation — such as poverty, homelessness or social exclusion — have increased risks of psychological or socio-emotional difficulties, behavioural problems, educational difficulties, and poor mental health as they grow.3, 4 Australia's children and young people shoulder specific inequities. The greatest gaps in outcomes and opportunities exist between Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander families and non-Indigenous families.5 They are also common for children in rural and remote settings compared with those in major cities.5 Not only a problem for the individual, these entrenched, lifelong disparities harm society by increasing health service costs and reducing economic productivity.6 Meeting basic material needs buffers children, young people and families from the negative consequences of early adversity and enhances the environments that support all children to thrive.7 The measurement of material basics is informed by three complementary and well established areas of science. The first is Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which recognises and outlines basic human needs from water and housing through to personal empowerment.8 The second area encompasses the non-health factors that play a substantial role in our health and wellbeing, known as the social and cultural determinants of health.9 These determinants, and the way our health, educational and social systems are designed to entrench them, are more impactful than almost all our available health services and supports.10 The third area is the increasing knowledge that adverse childhood experiences drive adult and intergenerational outcomes.11 Adversity refers to experiences of hardship, ranging from poverty and unstable or unsuitable housing through to neglect and abuse. The greater the number and severity of negative early life experiences, the higher the risk of poorer lifelong health and wellbeing.11 Together, these areas of science point to a broad but mutable range of determinants which, if ameliorated, would fundamentally alter children's and young people's developmental trajectories.12 Beyond the individual, such changes would also produce a measurable, positive change in key economic metrics and create a healthier society.13, 14 We acknowledge the tension between outcome areas that require universal solutions (provided to the whole population) and those that require targeted solutions (provided to priority subpopulations) even if delivered from a universal base (proportionate universalism). Notably, there are no annual, nationally representative measures of material basics in Australia. Australian censuses conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics most closely meet our criteria, with sufficient sample size and data on three domains collected every five years for all priority populations: childhood poverty (ages 0–24 years); housing stress, overcrowding and homelessness (ages 0–24 years); and young people not in education, employment or training (ages 15–24 years). At a minimum, these non-health determinants must be met to enable a healthy and equitable society. Below, we describe Australian census data on these domains for all children, and by sex (noting that sex [not gender] was collected in the censuses), remoteness, and Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander identity. Distribution of these data by relevant age groups is presented in Box 1, Box 2, Box 3, Box 4, Box 5 and the Supporting Information, and our key findings and conclusions are summarised in Box 6. We recognise that reporting proportions is limited, and that it would be more informative to also measure the amount of time young people experience adverse conditions. Key indicators include census data with proportions of children and young people (0–24-year-olds) who are: What is lacking? Data collected in the 2021 Australian census showed that: Increased household income benefits children directly through better food, stable housing, and health care (the “investment model”), and indirectly through improved parent mental health and capacity (the “family stress model”).7, 15, 16 In Australia, the poverty line has been traditionally defined by government as below 50% of median equivalised household income.17 The numbers and proportions of children and young people in poverty from the three most recent censuses are shown in Box 1 and the Supporting Information (table 1). In 2021, when Australia's population was 25.5 million, 586 274 children aged 0–14 years (13.2%) and 293 672 young people aged 15–24 years (10.2%) were living in poverty. The proportion of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children living in poverty (31.4%) was higher than that for non-Indigenous children (12.1%). In 2021, poverty was highest in remote and very remote areas (22.8%, compared with 12.2% in with major cities) and in the least advantaged areas (30.6%, compared with 3.7% in the most advantaged areas), as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas.18 No difference was found between boys (13.3%) and girls (13.2%) aged 0–14 years. In 2016, the overall childhood poverty proportion was 20.0% (829 132), suggesting that rates decreased in 2021. This may have been due to the temporary income supplements provided in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (eg, JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments). By September 2020, the pandemic economic responses had reduced poverty and housing stress to beyond pre-pandemic levels, but these rebounded a year later after the financial supports were withdrawn.19 In this section, we describe three separate but related measures of housing, as each offers policy levers for intervention. Housing stress is experienced when more than 30% of gross equivalised household income is spent on housing costs such as rent payments and mortgages.20 High housing costs cause increased financial stress, can reduce a household's ability to pay for other living expenses (such as food, transport, utilities and clothing), and can negatively affect health and wellbeing.21 As shown in Box 2 and the Supporting Information (table 2), an estimated 12.1% of 0–24-year-olds (803 962) lived in conditions of housing stress in 2021 — a decrease from 14.1% in 2016. Of the total children and young people experiencing housing stress in 2021, 529 433 of all children aged 0–14 years (12.9%) experienced housing stress and 274 529 of young people aged 15–24 years (10.8%) experienced housing stress. Housing stress was greater for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children (20.0%) than for non-Indigenous children (12.2%). Housing stress was also higher for children in major cities (13.1%) than for those in remote and very remote areas (6.9%). In addition, it was higher for children living in the least advantaged areas (25.2%) compared with those living in the most advantaged areas (4.3%). In Australia, housing stress has increased with cost-of-living pressures. Inflation over the 12 months to March 2023 was 7.3%, and the increase in inflation during the 12 months to November 2022 was the fastest since the 1990s.22 While increases in cost of living are being experienced across the population, they are more pronounced for subgroups such as low income earners, mortgage holders and renters.22 Households are considered overcrowded if they require one to three extra bedrooms according to the Canadian National Occupancy Standard.23 As shown in Box 3 and the Supporting Information (table 3), 724 327 children and young people (9.9%) were living in overcrowded households in 2021. Proportions were similar for different age groups and for boys versus girls. In the 2021 census, it was estimated that 47 515 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children (17.9%) lived in overcrowded conditions. Overcrowding was more common in remote and very remote areas (17.2%) compared with major cities (9.5%), and more common in households with children living in the least advantaged areas (20.1%) compared with those in the most advantaged areas (3.5%). A person is considered to be experiencing homelessness if they are: living in an improvised dwelling, tent or sleeping out; living in supported accommodation for homeless people; staying temporarily with another household, including couch surfing; staying in a boarding house or other temporary lodging; or living in a severely overcrowded situation (requiring four or more extra bedrooms).23 As shown in Box 4 and the Supporting Information (table 4), 41 107 children and young people (0.6%) were homeless in 2021. Rates of homelessness for children did not differ by sex, but 12 411 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children were homeless (3.0%). Of children aged 0–14 years living in remote and very remote areas, 4288 (4.7%) were homeless, and the homelessness rate for children aged 0–14 years who were living in the least advantaged areas (1.4%, 11 287 children) was higher than that for children living in the most advantaged areas (0.1%). As young people transition into adulthood, a key driver of poverty and poorer life outcomes is not continuing with employment, education or training (EET). As shown in Box 5 and the Supporting Information (table 5), census data from 2021 indicated that 274 387 young people aged 15–24 years (9.6%) were not in EET, of whom 89 660 were aged 15–19 years (6.5% of this age group) and 184 726 were aged 20–24 years (12.5% of this age group). The lower proportion for those aged 15–19 years reflects the fact that most young people in this age group are still at school. Not being in EET was more common for male (10.3%) than female (8.9%) young people. Overall, proportions declined from 10.2% in 2016 to 9.6% in 2021. Although proportions for male young people were similar in 2016 and 2021, there was a 2.1% percentage point decrease for female young people aged 20–24 years (from 14.1% in 2016 to 12.0% in 2021). In 2021, the proportions of male and female Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander 15–24-year-olds who were not in EET were almost the same (28.6% and 27.8% respectively); the proportions of male and female non-Indigenous 15–24-year-olds who were not in EET differed more markedly (9.3% and 7.9% respectively). In 2021, for young people aged 15–24 years, the largest proportion not in EET were living in remote and very remote areas (27.9%), and a much smaller proportion were living in major cities (8.6%). More young people not in EET were living in the least advantaged areas (18.4%) than in the most advantaged areas (4.5%). Attending to the material needs of children and young people seems a basic commitment of any just society. It is an area where the perspectives of child rights, economics and societal wellbeing align. We have shown that the proportions of children and young people who are deprived of material basics are stable, and the numbers are large. Although it is challenging to deal with these issues quickly, it should be possible to “move the needle” both in terms of absolute numbers and severity within the next seven years. Indeed, COVID-19 pandemic support payments showed this, and are increasingly relevant as the cost of living increases and access to material basics decreases.24 Societies that front-end their investment, spending more on childhood, are healthier societies.14 For next year's supplement on the Future Healthy Countdown 2030, we will invite researchers to demonstrate how ameliorating these factors is doable and beneficial. Current government policy agendas such as the Wellbeing Budget and the Early Years Strategy all point to this reality.25-27 Overseas, governments are moving this way too. Scotland, New Zealand, Iceland and Estonia have all made great strides, and the European Union has committed to a child guarantee which includes housing and a universal child benefit.28 The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that almost nothing is impossible, including giving families more money. So, if not now, then when?

In the absence of evidence for absolute decoupling of economic growth, material resource input and carbon emissions – and allowing for ‘catch-up’ development in poor countries – rich countries would need to review established development pathways and associated welfare standards to bring these in line with ecological thresholds and to reach UN climate targets. The paper discusses the provision of welfare in such a transition process with emphasis on the role of welfare and social policy. First, it introduces the concept of ‘sustainable welfare’ that integrates the two previously separate disciplines of welfare and sustainability research (Koch and Mont 2016). Distributive principles underlying existing welfare systems in the rich countries would need to be extended to include ‘non-citizens’: those affected in other countries and in the future. Sustainable welfare is oriented towards the satisfaction of human needs within ecological limits, from the intergenerational and global perspective. Second, the paper applies this concept to interpret ongoing comparative work on the environmental performance of real-world welfare states and the creation of synergy across economic, social and environmental policies. Finally, the paper discusses potential ‘eco-social’ policies such as wealth sharing, minimum and maximum incomes as well as carbon rationing that have the potential of moving existing (welfare) states closer to environmental sustainability.

which citizens can articulate their concerns and advocate for responsive governance.1 Children and young people are currently paying a high price, especially in terms of their health, because individuals aged under 18 years are not allowed to vote. The disenfranchisement of young people perpetuates political disillusionment and exacerbates health disparities.2 Historically, marginalised groups have experienced similar patterns of exclusion, leading to systemic neglect of their needs.3 In this 2024 MJA supplement article for the Future Healthy Countdown 2030,4 we argue that lowering the voting age to 16 years would empower young people and the political system to address inequities and build an inclusive society that promotes wellbeing. By examining the association between political participation and health outcomes, this article positions voting not merely as a democratic right but as a strategic intervention to improve public health (Box). This argument is grounded in the World Health Organization's conceptualisation of social determinants of health, which acknowledges that participation in political processes is essential for individual and community wellbeing.5 Political participation is a critical social determinant of health, fostering social inclusion, empowerment and equity, which are essential for mental and physical wellbeing.6 Voting, as a direct form of political participation, empowers individuals with a sense of agency over decisions that affect their lives.3 Historically, expanding voting rights has led to improved health outcomes. In the United States, for example, the enfranchisement of women and racial minorities reduced inequities, resulting in significant public health gains, including better education and income, and increased longevity.7, 8 These precedents suggest that extending voting rights to young people could similarly drive positive health outcomes by ensuring their representation in policy making. Young people face barriers to equitable access to health services, such as primary health care, and issues of trust and confidentiality, compounded by complex health issues such as sexual health, mental health, family violence and homelessness.9 Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, young people have been disproportionately affected by challenges such as the cost-of-living crisis, high education costs, lack of affordable housing, generational wealth inequities, and a highly casualised youth workforce.10 Currently, major social and policy issues in Australia — such as family violence, housing, education, climate change, social media, labour markets, income distribution, and criminal justice — affect all citizens, but are particularly relevant to young people given the developmental sensitivity of childhood and adolescence.11 Yet, young people remain largely absent from formal deliberative decision making on these issues; those in power are not compelled to consider their interests.12 The exclusion of young people's voices from meaningful political participation in adult-dominated decision-making processes is well documented across various policy areas, including climate change,13 poverty, and wealth inequality.3 Obesity is a prime example of the health consequences of excluding young people from policy decisions. Despite the staggering increase in obesity rates,5 often beginning in childhood and adolescence,14 and clear evidence of the negative impact of excessive sugar-sweetened beverages on obesity and type 2 diabetes,15, 16 governments have failed to take meaningful actions.17 Research shows that young people strongly support evidence-based government policies to restrict ""junk food"" marketing and improve food labelling.18, 19 However, despite this support, no substantial policy changes have been implemented.17 Instead, powerful lobbying by the beverage, food and sugar industries has led governments to adopt industry self-regulation, effectively prioritising industry profits over health.20 The COVID-19 pandemic exemplified how children and young people's experiences were overlooked in key government decisions, some resulting in considerable harm.4 The National Children's Commissioner acknowledged in 2023 that young people were rendered ""invisible"" during the pandemic.21 This invisibility manifested in two significant ways. First, there was a lack of direct communication with children and young people, which might have amplified some of their fear and distress.22 Instead, they were often left to receive critical information second-hand, even when it directly affected them.22 Second, their views were not considered in decisions that deeply affected them, such as school closures and curfews.22 The discussions around these measures focused primarily on adult concerns, such as the impacts on the economy and productivity, with inadequate consideration of the implications for children's education, healthy development and wellbeing.23 The lack of representation of young people was further underscored by the absence of a Cabinet Minister for children or a Youth Parliament at the federal level.24 Viewing policies solely from an adult-centric perspective during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a deterioration in the mental health of many children and young people, particularly those experiencing high levels of disadvantage.25 Peer relationships, crucial to young people's social development, were severely disrupted by the absence of in-person interactions.26 The repercussions of these policies continue to be felt, as evidenced by increases in delayed early childhood development, learning disabilities, and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents.26, 27 Beyond recognising the invisibility of young people during the COVID-19 pandemic, little has been done to address this substantive problem. Despite well intentioned commitments,28 budget announcements, policies29, 30 and programs31, 32 such as the National Action Plan for the Health of Children and Young People 2020–2030,29 ostensibly designed to promote the health and wellbeing of young people, there remains no formal procedural mechanism for young people to participate in deliberative decision-making processes. Although there has been an increase in youth involvement through platforms such as advisory committees, these often fall short of providing shared or equitable decision-making opportunities, treating participation as primarily educational rather than substantive.33 Without a political imperative to ensure that policies serve the interests of young people, there is a risk that policy making will continue to favour short term election cycle approaches rather than the long term health and wellbeing of our younger, non-voting generations. In 2024, the Australian Government released the report Engage! A strategy to include young people in the decisions we make. This report recognises that young people want their views valued and included in decisions that affect them, with 78.9% expressing a desire to be part of government decision making.28 In fact, young people in Australia regard ""having a say"" as being linked to wellbeing.34 In addition, the ""Make It 16"" campaign, a non-partisan initiative led by young people, calls for the federal government to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 years.35 This campaign highlights that 16-year-olds, already entrusted with responsibilities such as driving, consenting to medical procedures, joining the armed forces and being employed, deserve the right to vote. Movements such as the ""Make It 16"" campaign demonstrate that young people are eager to engage in formal political processes and influence the political and social issues shaping their lives. Despite concerns about declining voter turnout among young people, this should not be mistaken for political disinterest.36 Instead, extensive youth activism around critical issues such as climate change suggests that young people are politically and ethically engaged but are disillusioned with the traditional political systems. For instance, in 2021, a class action on behalf of all people aged under 18 years against the Environment Minister in the Federal Court underscored young people's lack of faith in achieving climate justice through traditional political channels.37 Increasingly, young people are turning to alternative forms of political engagement, such as protests, social enterprises, and volunteering, which focus on values and issues rather than aligning with traditional political institutions.38 This shift reflects their frustration with a system that fails to acknowledge or respond effectively to their needs. Young people feel disillusioned when their concerns are not addressed through policies and practices advocated by politicians, which may partly be due to their disproportionate absence from the voting demographic. Under procedural justice theory, people respond to policies better when they feel that the policy was made through a fair process, even more than the distributive fairness or consequences of the policy.39 Thus, by expanding the voting demographic to include 16-year-olds, young people would be fairly part of the policy creation process, and could more effectively influence political agendas, ensuring that issues pertinent to their health and future are prioritised.2 Lowering the voting age would also encourage politicians to align their policies more closely with the interests of young people, promoting civic engagement and supporting balanced state investments across different ages and generations.40 This approach could counterbalance the influence of powerful economic and commercial interests that often shape policies to the detriment of public health, ensuring that the long term wellbeing of all citizens is prioritised.41 Young people have unique insights into their challenges and ideas about how governments should respond.19 Ignoring their right to participate in the democratic process risks further disillusionment and may lead to implementing policies that could harm them. For example, as the federal government discusses the impact of social media on development, learning and mental health and considers potential bans for those aged under 16 years, the absence of young voices in these debates is glaring.42, 43 Social media affects young people's mental health in both positive and negative ways. While it can contribute to anxiety, depression and cyberbullying, it also offers vital support networks, reduces isolation, and supports social and emotional development.44 Many young people argue that banning social media platforms fails to recognise these nuanced effects and ignores the reality of growing up in a digital world. Instead of bans, they advocate for policies promoting digital literacy, transparency in algorithms, and responsible data practices to balance risks and benefits.45 Adult perspectives in these debates often reflect parental fears that do not always align with the views of young people. This generational disconnect can lead to policies that prioritise control over understanding and support. The proposed Health Legislation Amendment (Parental Access to Information) Bill 2003, which aimed to prioritise parental access to health data over young people's right to confidentiality, highlights this mismatch.9 Although the Bill was ultimately withdrawn due to opposition from the medical community, it underscores the need for young people to advocate for their rights and interests. Lowering the voting age to 16 years would empower young people to ensure their perspectives are considered in policy development, particularly on matters directly affecting their health and wellbeing. Including young people's voices in these discussions would not only enhance democratic participation but also lead to more informed and balanced policy making that better reflects the needs of all citizens and supports the mental and emotional health of the younger generation. Lowering the voting age to 16 years is justified on developmental and participatory democracy grounds. By age 16, individuals have developed the cognitive capacity for logical reasoning and decision making, reaching similar levels of moral and scientific reasoning as adults.46-48 The responsibilities currently entrusted to 16-year-olds — such as driving, consenting to medical procedures, and access to employment — demonstrate their ability to make informed decisions. Specifically, cognitive ability has never been a criterion for voting eligibility; there is no upper age limit for voting, nor is there a requirement for cognitive testing. This underscores that voting is a fundamental democratic right, not contingent on cognitive assessments. Many countries around the world have already lowered the voting age to 16 years.49 Examining these international examples provides valuable insights for Australia. In Austria, where voting has been compulsory for all eligible citizens (including 16- and 17-year-olds) since 2007, this practice has led to high levels of youth engagement and increased attention to youth-specific issues.50 Conversely, in Scotland, where the voting age was lowered to 16 years for Scottish Parliament and local government elections, voting is not compulsory for any age group. As demonstrated during the independence referendum, Scotland's approach showed that young voters could engage thoughtfully with complex political issues and influence significant outcomes, even without compulsory voting.51 These international cases highlight the importance of aligning voting policies with the specific democratic and cultural context of each country. However, implementing such policies requires careful consideration of local conditions to ensure the successful integration of young voters into the democratic process. Given Australia's tradition of compulsory voting, extending this practice to younger voters would maintain consistency across the voting population and align with the national approach to civic duty52 as opposed to introducing optional voting for this age group. Concerns about criminalising young people for non-participation can be mitigated through thoughtful implementation. Adequate support, education, and outreach are necessary to maximise engagement and address potential challenges, ensuring that young voters are well prepared to participate in shaping their country's future. For example, to support first time voters and ensure a smooth transition, measures such as robust civic education programs, clear communication about voting responsibilities, and supportive initiatives including reminders and information campaigns targeted at young voters should be introduced. In addition, leniency or grace periods for non-participation in the early stages could help alleviate fears of criminalisation and foster positive voting habits. Lowering the voting age to 16 years would acknowledge young people's right and ability to actively participate in shaping their present and future lives. Such a change would encourage politicians to consider the concerns of young people, foster civic engagement, and strengthen the democratic traditions of Australia's electoral system. Historical and international examples demonstrate that expanding voting rights improves health outcomes and societal benefits. Health and politics are deeply intertwined; an equitable society supports the best health dividends.53 Although extending the right to vote to younger citizens is not a complete solution to political disillusionment, it is an essential step toward bridging the intergenerational divide and promoting health policies that are preventively and proactively oriented.40 The critical question, therefore, is not why young people should be granted the right to vote, but why they should be denied it.

solid middle class is the cornerstone of a vibrant economy. However, households at the middle of the income distribution have faced many challenges that raise the question of whether middle-class living standards are within reach for middle-income Americans in today's economy. The past decade has been sobering. Years after the Great Recession, middle-income families still had not fully recovered wealth lost during the Great Recession due to declines in asset prices and persistent increases in unemployment caused by the crisis. Now the Covid-19 pandemic deals another severe blow to their already precarious financial conditions. The Federal Reserve System convened a Community Development Research Conference in 2019, Renewing the Promise of the Middle Class, to address the challenges and identify opportunities to maintain the middle class and keep alive the heart of the American dream. This Contemporary Economic Policy symposium reflects the research presented at that conference. These original articles have been double-blind reviewed, and cover many pertinent issues that speak to the promise of the middle class and the challenges faced by these households. Wolff's paper, “The declining wealth of the middle class,” provides a sobering sketch of the contours of the overall level of wealth declines experienced by the middle class, which started in the 1980s and became even more pronounced during and after the Great Recession. Wolff also analyzes savings rates over time and argues that differential leverage represents a critical factor in explaining wealth inequality trends for middle-class households compared to high-wealth households. Toussaint-Comeau's paper “Liquidity constraints and debts” shows the widespread prevalence of liquidity constraints and low savings rates in the middle class. Toussaint-Comeau's results show that heavy reliance on credit to meet (un)expected expenses is pronounced for the middle class in particular. This heavy use of credit hinders their ability to save for wealth-building essentials, such as a first-home purchase, savings for their children's education, or have a stock of cash to pay for unexpected medical expenses. The paper's findings echo the research sounding an alarm that the opportunity for many households to reach financial security may be receding and calls for policies to encourage appropriate wealth-building strategies, strengthen consumer protection, and propagate transparency regarding debt costs. Darity Jr., Addo, and Smith's paper, “A subaltern middle class,” argues that Black households face extreme challenges in obtaining middle-class living standards because of persistent racial gaps in wealth. Immense disparities exist between Blacks in the middle of the Black income distribution and Whites in the middle of the White income distribution. The gulf in financial wealth translates into a lower likelihood that Black middle-income households survive economic downturns and financial shocks to the same extent as White households. The authors discuss several policy recommendations to foster a vibrant Black middle class and reduce racial wealth inequality. The authors argue that to end Blacks' subaltern status in American society, we must design a comprehensive national program to close the wealth gap. Azomahou and Yitbarek's paper, “Intergenerational mobility in education,” expands upon a critical mechanism through which inequality of opportunities persist in an international setting. In their study of intergenerational transmission of education in Africa, they find that, despite drastic changes in educational systems and investments in human capital accumulation since the 1960s in the region, and after former colonies gained independence, parental education remains a strong determinant of children's educational outcomes, especially of daughters. Their results make a strong case for the importance of targeted redistributive policies and the expansion of secondary education to improve economic mobility, especially for women. Angrisani, Barrera, Blanco, and Contreras, in their paper “The racial/ethnic gap in financial literacy in the population and by income,” continues on the topic of education, and more precisely on financial literacy, which according to the National Financial Education Council, is a global “illiteracy epidemic.” The authors find substantial racial/ethnic gaps in financial literacy in the US population that further correlate with childhood family circumstances and income class. The authors document alarming rates of financial illiteracy among the middle class. This result is especially concerning because this group of households faces liquidity constraints and difficult savings choices. The authors' results underscore the need for policies and initiatives that would remove barriers to financial literacy in order to improve the management of available financial resources, promote financial inclusion, and reduce the declining economic mobility in the middle class. Hartmann and Hayes' paper, “Estimating benefits: Proposed national paid family and medical leave programs,” evaluates several programs that provide income support during periods of family care needs, important policies in terms of reducing income inequality. The authors develop evidence on how such policies could benefit families more equitably. They find that programs preventing asset depletion in difficult times are necessary for households to maintain or achieve a middle-class standard of living. Many working-age middle-class individuals lack health insurance or are underinsured. They struggle with medical bills and debt. The paper by Fitzpatrick and Fitzpatrick, “Health insurance transitions and use of fringe banks,” addresses the rising use of fringe banking and the high costs associated with those financial products, as well as the heavy use of these services by the low- and middle-income households uninsured before the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The authors find that that ACA afforded individuals in lower-to-middle income groups to acquire health insurance. In turn, the changes generated by the ACA correlates quite significantly to changes in the use of fringe banks. Health insurance improved the poor's financial stability, offsetting the need to use costly financial debt products. There are few instances where an economic journal has devoted a large symposium to the middle-class topic. This group of papers documents the ongoing economic crisis faced by middle-class households and offers germane and timely policy prescriptions for this important issue. I am particularly pleased to guest edit this symposium and hope it will encourage more economic research focused on the middle class. I thank CEP editor Brad Humphreys for his help on this project, especially for his editorial handling of my paper in the Symposium.",,Maude Toussaint-Comeau,false,,false,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/coep.12534

interrelated challenges presented by climate change and health inequities. Climate change is having impacts globally, but in Australia, rural communities are on the frontline of climate change impacts.1 And, as I write, with bushfire states of emergency declared in New South Wales and Queensland, there is a political stand-off dominating the media about whether to talk about climate change at this time during an emergency event or if climate change is a factor in these fires at all. The Climate Council2 (backed by the latest Lancet countdown report3) does not doubt that these catastrophic fires are unprecedented, and the result of fire conditions are exacerbated by record-breaking drought, very dry fuels and soils, and record-breaking heat. With each extreme weather event, there are increasing numbers of rural communities being exposed to more frequent and severe bushfires, floods and coastal cyclones, resulting in injuries, deaths, bereavements and post-traumatic stress disorders.2, 4 The impact of these events can also lead to solastalgia (which is the distress felt by environmental change impacting on people while they are directly connected to their home environment)5 and ecological grief (a mental health response to climate change-related loss).6 And extreme weather events also lead to social and political instabilities, disrupting social systems, structures and economies.7 Rural communities are already experiencing these issues. Climate change has been described as a risk multiplier.8 It is not that climate change creates new diseases or health issues, more that it exacerbates what is already there.9 It amplifies or extends a population's pre-existing health risks or problems.10 In the case of rural Australia where there are already higher levels of unemployment, welfare dependency, lower incomes, higher rates of chronic disease and risk factors, injuries and hospitalisation compared with those in major cities, adapting to climate change adds another burden. Fundamentally, climate change is an equity issue, as it impacts the most on the most vulnerable people that typically have fewer resources, such as less money, choice, power and social connections to cope, and the capacity to adapt or recover.11 At a basic level, humans need clean air, water, shelter and food. Humans also need protection from elements, security, order, law, stability and freedom from fear.12 Climate change affects all of these dimensions. Climate change and equity are intergenerational (between the current generations), intragenerational (for the generations to come) and with the 6th mass extinction in progress (due to human activities from the clearing of habitats, population increase and pollution) includes environmental justice for all other living creatures now and the future. It accentuates how maldistribution of power and influence impact on the structural drivers of those conditions of daily life—globally, nationally and locally in our everyday lives13 which is never more evident than in the inequities that are experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. This was brought into stark focus by Bruce Shillingsworth, Muruwari and Budjiti man who appeared on ABC's Q&A TV show focusing on drought.14 Bruce's comments brought out in the open the impact water commodification and drought is having on health and well-being of Australia's First Peoples; and the power differential that exists, when there is no First Peoples’ voice in the water rights debate. Access to water (a basic human right) is also an immediate issue for rural towns such as Stanthorpe and Warwick in Queensland, Pooncarie in New South Wales and Scotdesco, on the eastern fringe of the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia. From an intragenerational equity perspective, rural children today and future generations will inequitably suffer from the impacts of climate change. A child born today will experience a world that is more than four degrees warmer than the pre-industrial average, with climate change impacting human health from infancy and adolescence to adulthood and old age3 in ways that did not affect their ancestors/ parents. But climate change and the rapidity of change is also challenging the resilience and adaptability of the rural Australian land and seascapes; and affecting other biological and planetary systems, including soil; ocean acidification affecting sea life, and biodiversity loss with changes to native vegetation and its distribution and abundance.15 To address climate change and health equity requires thinking of these issues as two sides of the same coin, as to address one could unintentionally worsen the other.16 Mutual “wins” have been identified that create benefits to health and for the climate. For example, there are co-benefits for policies that promote safe, affordable and accessible use of active transport by using public transport, cycling and walking. These strategies have health equity gains as well as value in climate change mitigation.14 Unfortunately, many of the policy solutions are best suited for larger urban centres and not small remote communities with no public transport, larger distances between settlements, low amenity, outdated infrastructure and food insecurity. Rural solutions must be developed in consultation with rural communities and recognise that what works in larger urban places is not the fix for rural. Particularly, when mitigation and adaptation strategies are literally for survival and are dependent on a deep understanding of the natural and the physical environment17 as well as community networks. Australia, from a national perspective, is lagging behind in developing adaptation and mitigation strategies, but the scale and urgency of action are making this an imperative, particularly for rural communities. In many ways, climate change is like a chronic condition, with multiple risk factors and a long latency period until symptoms are revealed. Once the disease is present, it is about managing symptoms, like pain and psychological distress and maintaining quality of life. In the absence of a national approach, rural communities urgently need policies and funding to address heatwaves, air pollution particularly industrial air pollution and aeroallergens; water security, vector-borne diseases, emergency preparedness for extreme weather events, and dedicated funding to support greening the rural health care sector. But most of all, Australia as a whole needs a national approach to urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition from fossil fuel dependency to renewable energy sources, have a serious rethink about land use policy and strengthening protection and conservation of ecosystems, as well as a rapid move to support sustainable agriculture and transport. All with a rural proofing lens. To meet the challenge of climate change and health inequity, Australia needs a national preventive approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition from fossil fuel dependency to renewable energy sources, have a serious rethink about land use policy and strengthening protection and conservation of ecosystems, as well as a rapid move to support sustainable agriculture and transport.

limited face-to-face learning (PTMT). The method used was descriptive qualitative with the subject of teachers in the Malang City area. Data was collected by using a survey distributed online through Google Forms. The results showed that the implementation pattern ofconstructivist theory in limited face-to-face learning (PTMT) was carried out through 5 (five) base of learning implementation, namely the application of problem-based learning, the application of project-based learning, the use of digital-based teaching materials and media, the application of psychosocial learning and contextuallearning. Teachers carried out limited face-to-face learning by applying constructivist theory massively and gradually, starting from planning, the process of learning activities, and learning evaluation. In addition to the use of media and 5M learning models in this study, the application of constructivist theory in PTMT learning aimed to help students become more active and teachers as moderators be more innovative. Learning process carried out at the elementary school level was only 50 percent attendance at the maximum. The implementation of student-centered learning showed 45% was very good, 50% was good, 2.5% was good, 2.5% was not good. The results showed that the inhibiting factor for student-centered implementation was the limited duration of time in learning. On the other hand, there were also restrictions on interactions carried out in the classroom so that teachers experienced a decline in exploring the learning process.

The results showed that the inhibiting factor for student-centered implementation was the limited duration of time in learning. On the other hand, there were also restrictions on interactions carried out in the classroom so that teachers experienced a decline in exploring the learning process.
Keywords: constructivism theory. limited face-to-face learning, elementary school.

The main advantage of this model is that it better fits the data and the socioeconomic context of the poor countries. The parent-children relationship is part of a whole set of values and social norms that evolve over time and are affected by changes in the economic environment. Intergenerational transfers from parents to children are not due to an intrinsic value, which is independent and invariant to economic changes.",,,theoretical,,theoretical,,

The results show that 76.0% of the offspring with relatively poor parents exit relative poverty, and only 23.9% of the offspring with not relatively poor parents become relatively poor. Parents' income affects offspring's mainly through offspring's work, rather than their education. One possible reason is that early engagement in manual work crowds out their educational acquisition. Furthermore, women are disadvantaged in the intergenerational mobility. Reducing the cost of education, improving the quality of employment and focusing on female groups will better facilitate intergenerational mobility in rural China.",Error fetching abstract,,empirical,,empirical,,

opportunities, for economies throughout the Asia Pacific region. Economic prosperity and its sustainability will be influenced by how we respond to a number of core drivers, including the re-emergence of Asia as a major centre of the global economy, rapid demographic change, environmental pressures and technological advances. These drivers will put additional pressure on the fiscal sustainability and on the institutions that have contributed greatly to economic performance to date. These things are often taken for granted but will have significant implications for future economic prosperity throughout the region. Already a growth engine of the global economy, Asia will be home to the largest middle-class population in the world before too long. The associated opportunities and the risks make it necessary that we have the right global, regional and country policy frameworks. The Asian century will also see rapid demographic change. The ageing of populations throughout the region and changing community expectations about the provision of public services will see increased demand for health and aged care. The fiscal policy responses to these pressures are yet to be figured out. Another changing feature of this century will be climate change. To avoid catastrophic climate change, substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are needed. Unfortunately, some climate change will now be unavoidable, and economies will also need to adapt to higher temperatures. How countries, such as China, transition to high-income status will also be crucial. Policy frameworks that help facilitate industrial upgrading, innovation and investment in human capital will be important to drive productivity and avoid the so-called middle income trap. Many countries will be watching how Japan handles a shrinking and ageing population and the fiscal pressures that come with financing a higher dependency ratio. South Korea, China and others will be facing a similar demographic crunch in the near future. China's ability to clean up its environment will be crucial for the Chinese population but also China's neighbours. Other countries like Australia will be finding ways to innovate and lift productivity to keep living standards growing after an unprecedented commodities boom. These are the issues with which this special issue of Asia and the Pacific Policy Studies deals. The papers are the result of a multidisciplinary conference organised by the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Crawford School of Public Policy in 2015. Papers were discussed in depth by leading scholars and senior government officials. Policy practitioners usually do not get time to think in depth about longer-term issues and especially not across a range of areas. The starting point in thinking about sustainability and welfare is to shift our focus from measuring output, or GDP, in annual flows, to taking account of stock of assets—the productive base for wellbeing. Wealth accounting can give us more insight into which countries are investing for the future as opposed to using up valuable assets just to boost short-term growth. One common theme highlighted in the papers is that the economies throughout the region need to begin preparing for the challenges and opportunities of the future. The policy actions taken or missed today will have a significant bearing on future outcomes.",,Shane D. Johnson; S.

What are the corresponding intergenerational welfare implications? I incorporate human capital and capital accumulation into a dynamic multi-country general equilibrium model, and study the exact transitional path. Interactions between comparative advantage, capital accumulation, and endogenous education are the main driving forces of the inequality dynamics. These channels reflect ability to adjust factor supply at different stages of the transition. I parameterize the model for 40 countries, six sectors. Trade liberalization raises the skill premium, the skill share and the real wage for both skilled and unskilled workers in all countries in my model. Through decomposition, I find that education eliminates trade-induced inequality by 65% on average. My model also suggests that globalization can cause more intergenerational inequality. Because older and more educated people generally benefit relatively more from globalization.","How does international trade affect transitional dynamics of the relative wage for unskilled workers when educational decisions and capital accumulation are considered? By including these channels in a dynamic quantitative trade model, I show that reduced trade costs increase the skill premium and educational attainment in the steady state. On the transitional path, capital accumulation and capital-skill complementarity cause a more drastic increase in the skill premium in the earlier transition.

The model, rationalising the use of transition matrices to measure occupational mobility, allows for identifying asymmetric mobility patterns and constructing a specific mobility index for each determinant. The empirical application of our model to Italy suggests that intergenerational mobility increased from the cohort of children born in the period 1940-1951 to the one born in the period 1952-1965, then to remain at the same level for the cohort of children born in the period 1966-1977. This steady mobility, however, hides i) lower structural mobility, caused by a declining trend in the composition of occupations in favour of upper-middle classes; ii) less upward mobility for those whose fathers were in the lower class; and iii) higher downward mobility from upper-middle classes, both caused by a decrease in the income incentives. Equality of opportunity is low and constant for those born after 1951.",,I. Brunetti; D. Fiaschi,both,,empirical,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10888-023-09568-8.pdf

Regression models were estimated using data from 2,596 parents whose youngest child was at least 40 years old in the 2012 (the 4th wave) KLOSA (Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing). Sons’ employment and marital status and daughters’ marital status (excluding children’s coresidence status) was significantly associated with their parents’ levels of wellbeing. Moreover, parents’ income moderated the associations between children’s outcomes and the level of their parents’ life satisfaction. Unemployed sons and single sons and daughters jeopardized the life satisfaction of their mothers with low income, but not other subgroups, and coresidence with sons decreased the life satisfaction of fathers with high income, but not those with low income. In line with how the results suggest that parental psychological outcomes regarding adult children’s circumstances may be different depending on income, this study has implications for intergenerational relationships in the sociocultural context. These findings also imply that parents may have different views about norms regarding the transition to adulthood depending on their economic backgrounds. In sum, based on the life course perspective and a stress process model, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of how adult children and family structural factors may contribute to individuals’ wellbeing in old age.",,M.

As editors, we're becoming even more attuned to its richness, and the complexities of pulling together such various formats and possibly even forms. Hau includes research articles submitted individually by authors from around the world, familiar to those in many anthropological journals, and subjected to a rigorous double-blind review process. We hope to expand the space devoted to individually submitted manuscripts in the future. We also include work that is not subject to editing or revision—such as the reprints of materials that are now hard to find, translations, distinguished lectures, and colloquia. We publish short reflections on current issues—the ""shortcuts"" sections, debates between two positions, and symposia on recently published books. Our hallmark, however, has always been the carefully curated and multiply reviewed special sections and special issues on provocative topics that are currently being debated or revisited in anthropology. We want to reiterate our call in the last issue for proposals for new and exciting formats from our readership. As readers, we drank deeply of these rich drafts; as editors, we are discovering the breadth of their sources, the many different technical requirements for their ""brewing,"" and the pleasure of watching them mature into our (now for a limited time) open-access publication.In the third issue of volume 8 (2018), Hau published the first half of a themed collection on ""The Turn to Life."" The collection was wide-ranging in scope, from philosophical contemplations on the meaning of life itself (Pina-Cabral, Schrempp, Jackson) to ethnographic and personal explorations of ""vitality"" or the life-force as something that waxes and wanes (Singh), to asking how the anthropological canard of ""everyday life"" occurs at the conjunction of the social and the subjective-subjunctive. A rich subsection (introduced by Retsikas and Marsden, with articles by Anderson, Pickering, Schneider, Retsikas, Achilli, and Chappatte) explored the ways in which people in specific ethnographic studies seek to enhance their lives through ""alternative modes of prosperity."" It turns out that by suggesting a focus on ""life itself""—a turn to life—our authors were able to raise new questions, bring new perspectives to old ones, and see new things in the lives of people around the world.We carry that turn to life forward in this issue, with a set of articles solicited in 2018 by Giovanni da Col. Two of the pieces examine how what might, in other framings, be considered infrastructure are also forms of life itself, and how transformations of that infrastructural world (""development"") also transforms forms of life—the life of a river, and the life of roads. Andrew Johnson describes how, as sources of power become more distant for fishermen on the Mekong River—including upstream hydropower dams and emigrant spouses sending remittances—the powerful river beings that had inhabited its waters become more ""spectral,"" their potency shifting into a less proximate dimension of being. Reminiscent of Ben Okri's novel The famished road (1992), in which a road built at the site of a river continues to be haunted by riverine spirits, including those of prematurely deceased ""spirit children"" who affect the prospects of those seeking wealth and livelihoods along the route, Matthäus Rest and Alessandro Rippa analyze the ways in which roads are perceived as subjects acting powerfully upon the lives of people they reach and connect. In Pakistan, for example, the Karakoram highway is held responsible for enriching the material lives of people, but also of destroying much of their traditional lives and subjecting them to increased state control. Rest and Rippa do not suggest that the road itself is a living being, so much as that its potency grows—a term associated with ""life itself""—out of the interconnections among people who give birth to it and who effectively enliven it. Drawing on the work of Tim Ingold, and traveling roads from Nepal to those of the Austrian Alps, these authors challenge us to recognize the animacy of roads in their forms of becoming and their multiple entanglements with life and lives around them.Neena Mahadev and Michael Puett start not with life, but with death. Mahadev, in her article on Buddhism and Christianity in Sri Lanka, begins with the thirty thousand deaths there in the 2004 tsunami, the suspected murder of a monk, and the suspicions that the dead may have deserved to die because of past misdeeds or the failure to embrace the miracles of the new religion. Death in both Christianity and Buddhism is, however, only a moment toward rebirth, an interruption in persistent life, one shaped by an intergenerational past, and a hoped-for better future. Grace, Mahadev argues, is a vitalistic manifestation that animates the being of ""born-again"" Christians as they free themselves from intergenerational and personal sin, and seek prosperous lives (and afterlives) free from suffering; karma, by contrast, acts through suffering, and suffering must be embraced in order to find eventual release from desire for things (i.e., prosperity in the conventional sense). Both forms of life, she notes, turn in the current politico-economic context on reckoning with sins as well as blessings, in past and present—a life lived in ledgers, as it were—and seek sudden redemption from suffering, or to use suffering to attain release. Second-century China, as discussed by Puett, was awash with the dead as well, or rather with the pervasive presence of ghosts, who fed on sacrifices, and whose hunger for more caused them to pester (or even kill) the living, thus bringing about more sacrifices so that ""death (yin) was overcoming life (yang)."" Puett uses this threat to life to critically assess classic anthropological concerns with ritual and sacrifice, looking at ancient China, where humans were ""a mess"" of diverse energies and souls, hard to tease out or manage, especially as they became disorganized and released at death. But the rituals that attempted to organize the different vital energies had dangers: successful, the organized energies risked being too orderly, too hierarchical, and, in the end, sterile, and therefore not vital at all. Puett suggests that sacrifice, as the core practice in managing disparate and potentially disorderly vital energies, should be seen not, as it so often has been, as a way for society to triumph over death, but instead as a form of empowerment in which unruly power is appropriated through a subjunctive and ultimately always unsuccessful work of organization. But rejecting ritual also fails to bring together the discordance between a well-ordered world and messy lives: too much order kills life. In both Puett's and Mahadev's articles, death becomes a matter of life.Carrying forward, from Hau 8 (3), an investigation into ""vitality,"" Knut Christian Myhre and Fernando Santos-Granero write about ""life itself"" and its distributions, transitions, and forms of constitution of various kinds of beings. Myhre presents the many complex forms in which moo, life, emerges from movements, processes, and spatial relationships among Chagga-speaking people in Tanzania. Drawing on Wittgenstein's language games, Myhre considers life to be the changeable product of ""inflection points"" where life-force is brought into play in transformations between its force and life itself. Myhre traces the seemingly innumerable ways in which moo appears in language, to show how life appears in the inflections of vitality, reproduction, and life-force across a range of beings, places, and things. ""Life,"" he writes, ""is an effect of conversions and conveyances of horu that occur between persons, houses, animals, and crops to afford the becoming and constitute the being of other persons, houses, animals, and crops."" Neither life nor life-force (vitality) is a thing in itself, but each emerges in changeable form as it is engaged in transitions and transformations; it is the play of these ""transfers and transformations"" that allows for changeable life forms. Similar perhaps to the Chinese case discussed by Puett, here too, fixed, changeless form or formality would be a kind of death, and certainly not life. Building on his pioneering study of native Amazonian ""control over the mystical means of reproduction"" as a form of power (Santos-Granero 1986), and on his more recent study of historical forms of native South American slavery and servitude in Vital enemies (Santos-Granero 2009), Fernando Santos-Granero points out that various language groups in Amazonia also distinguish between vitality as life-force, and vitality as ""vital principle,"" although they do so differently and relate the two differently. Consistently, though, both may be held in greater or lesser quantity, are subject to scarcity, and may be found in, and transmitted between, not only those things considered ""living"" in Western thought, but also ""inanimate"" objects and immortal beings. Because these are two different things—life-force and vitality—there are living beings lacking vitality, and the vitally forceful without life, although many contain fluctuating amounts of each attribute. By contrast with the Chagga case, however, and because vitality and life-force are limited and scarce, the relationships between vital beings and transfers between them are marked by hostility and aggression, with possibilities for diplomacy, leaving some weakened and some strengthened, in a fierce competition among people, animals, places, objects, and the world in general. Santos-Granero's Amerindian system, centered on scarcity, is the inversion of Georges Bataille's ""general economy"" of life, a system based on the observation that the surplus natural energy produced in the world and beyond (beginning with the sun), its excess, must be ""lost without profit; it must be spent … gloriously or catastrophically"" ([1967] 1991: 21). Santos-Granero describes this situation as a political economy of life, contrasting this approach with those that see the transfers in terms of ""exchanges,"" ecological balance, or circulations, as Bataille, in dialogue with Mauss, conceived. And because vitality is not only scarce, but potentially present in much of the nonhuman world, from minerals to plants and animals, as well as the well-being of people, the extractive economy brought to the Amazon by Westerners fits only too well within the political economy of predation.This issue's research articles come from a set of mostly younger scholars, whose topics focus on questions of knowledge and power, authority and value, the everyday and the religious, and where and how ethnography happens. This is the basic stuff of anthropological studies, but as happens with the best of anthropology, new ethnography forces us to rethink the concepts and relationships, and to probe what is at stake in doing so. Most baldly—and boldly—we find this challenge in the article by Tomás Bartoletti, in which he asks why we use concepts from the European Enlightenment to understand ancient Greece, relying on ""ethnophilological epistemic"" objectifications drawn from both Greek texts and early explorer and colonial documents. Instead, he reexamines ancient Greek practice—divination in particular—through key concepts in Andean ritual praxis. Looking at the practice of divination in ancient Greece through a reconstructed understanding of colonial-era Andean divination—w'aka—constitutes a veritable ethnographic theorizing in which analytics can be developed from elsewhere than in canonical social scientific intellectual genealogies. Bartoletti finds that his approach brings to light ideas about a ""cosmopraxis of cure"" that operates at a juncture of nature, the human, and the supernatural or metahuman; weaving back and forth between ancient Greece and Andean studies, he offers a different perspective on the ways in which nature, human, and the divine are brought together, while also proposing new approaches to the comparative method.Daniel Birchok's article focuses on Teungku Sum, a young Acehnese teacher in an Islamic boarding school, who is in search of his predestined spouse. The ethnographic case is the occasion for asking how Islam in Aceh confounds two ethical dilemmas. These dilemmas—that of the teacher and that of the anthropologist—hinge on how both bring seemingly opposing frames into relation with each other. Apparently disjunct fields like the hereafter and the immediate, destiny and seeking, reflection and urgency are juxtaposed in unstable yet compelling ways, which inform an everyday life in which the secular and the religious are intertwined. Teungku Sum brings together and pulls apart the promise of this world and the promise of the next; Birchok brings together and also pulls apart questions of living an ""Islamic everyday"" in which living ethically means juggling different temporalities and, through them, a heterogeneous reflexivity for Teungku Sum.What do you do when, having devoted much of your scholarship to exploring the creation and nature of value, you are asked to think about things without value? Michael Cepek takes on this challenge in a way that enriches his (and our own) understandings of value and of the Cofán people in Amazonian Ecuador. Along the way, he also shows the surprising places in which theoretical work can be done. Adding to recent rehabilitations of Pierre Clastres's work in Amazonian anthropology, he is drawn to the notion of ""powerless power,"" a form of resistance to the concentration of power in the state form—and to state intrusions in indigenous life—which suggests to Cepek the possibility of an analogous ""valueless value,"" created by nonhuman action, and which hence does not express the labor of the Cofán people. Valueless value is embodied in the shaman, initiated by a host of foreign and dangerous nonhuman agents, despised for his violence and moral ambivalence, but whose abilities nonetheless provide the conditions for the tranquil existence that the Cofán strive to create through their own human endeavors. Cepek's analysis resonates with Terence Turner's study of the ""fearful symmetry"" of the jaguar for the Kayapó (Hau 7[2]), which conjugates beauty and ferocity, power and antisociality. It is no accident that the Cofán shaman is linked to the lonely jaguar, while nonshamans are linked to the gregarious woolly monkeys—apex predator and prototypical prey. The paradox that Cepek's article makes explicit is how the former can be a guarantee for the latter.Stefan Binder examines the atheist movement in southern India, focusing on how members of the Miracle Exposure Program attempt to rebalance the value of miracles and magic through staged performances. While others have focused on how atheists debunk miracles performed by babas as sleight-of-hand, like the magic tricks performed by conjurers, to discredit religious belief, Binder draws our attention to the performed lessons about authority, belief, and the location of modernity. The staged performances draw heavily on a pedagogical form, including both lecture and demonstration, but add a regular pattern of question-and-answers, in which the audience is interpellated, much as in a classroom students are by their teacher. The roles are then reversed, and the audience questions the performer. The goal here is to create a questioning mindset, one that locates power with the individual and not institutions of the modern state, such as those of formal education. At the same time, while the program suggests that the babas ""conceal"" what they know and use hidden knowledge as a form of power, atheist leaders enact a process of revelation that effectively performs their own authoritative knowledge. This leads some audience members—now informed by an epistemology of suspicion and questioning, and a recognition that the teachers have authoritative knowledge in reserve, which is the result of that very performance—to demand that performers reveal the sources of their knowledgeIn the opening seminar of his Écrits, on Edgar Allan Poe's ""The purloined letter,"" Jacques Lacan famously argued that ""a letter always arrives at its destination.""1 In Poe's story, the compromising, multiply stolen letter defied all but Dupin, with his keen observational and analytical powers, by being hidden for months in plain sight over the mantelpiece in the thieving minister's living room. Ultimately, Dupin subtracts it from the minister, replacing it with a counterfeit note of his own, and returns it to ""the important personage"" who would have been compromised by the note. Lacan's analysis of this story becomes the occasion to make key observations about language, intersubjectivity, communication, and psychoanalytic methods. Possession of the letter—he notes—is more important than its contents. Why else, he asks (anachronistically, to our postepistolary sensibilities), would a lover insist on the return of love letters after the end of a relationship, when their original function has long been fulfilled? ""The sender … receives from the receiver his own message in reverse form. Thus it is that what the 'purloined letter' … means is that a letter always arrives at its destination"" (also see Roudinesco and Plon 2006).Lacan's analysis of the vicissitudes of a purloined letter offers a counterpoint to Raminder Kaur's account of the circuitous routes of a ""carefully worded"" emailed letter whose sensitive subject matter—potential human rights and environmental regulation violations in the construction of a nuclear power plant in India—also raises issues about visibility and secreting on a different scale. Kaur uses the multiple digital locations of this letter as an instance of what Luciano Floridi calls ""onlife,"" or ""the new experience of a hyperconnected reality within which it is no longer sensible to ask whether one may be online or offline."" At the intersection of online and offline worlds, texts move, enfolding and unfolding through different fora, highlighting relationships, histories, and projects, and sometimes reshaping conversations. Engaging the now-common idea of a multisited ethnography, but in favor instead of a multisituational approach, Kaur revisits the Manchester School's views on the method—a focus on events and situations that highlight tensions and conflicts that usually are latent in the social world. An iconic work that is usually held up as an example of this approach is Max Gluckman's 1940 article ""Analysis of a social situation in modern Zululand"" (reprinted in Gluckman 1958). In her own work, Kaur looks at the situations that emerge, dissipate, and reemerge across virtual, media, televisual, and physical space surrounding the emailed letter signed by a diverse, distantly located group of people ranging from UK-based activists and politicians to India-based sympathizers, and submitted to the Indian government. She also analyzes the refractions of the letter in the media, in newspaper fora to which readers contributed, in online discussion groups, and in its performative role as it was invoked by protestors, and as it motivated the UK government to empanel a commission of inquiry into the proposed nuclear power plant. Similarly to Poe's letter—in Lacan's analysis—the letter exists not as something owned by its authors, or as a material document, but as it becomes ""enfolded"" and unfolds in a series of differently situated histories, intentions, struggles, and dramatic stagings. While Kaur is still attentive to the people brought together by the circulation of this letter, the novelty of her approach is her focus on the situations in which her email gets folded.We would once again like to draw the attention of our readers to changes in the structure of the journal, as outlined in last issue's editorial note. The editorial collective of Hau Journal is exclusively responsible for the journal. Although we share a scientific editorial board with Hau Books, the two entities have separate editorial collectives. Likewise, the role of the Digital Editor, and publications in Hau social media, are independent of both Hau Journal and Hau Books. We would like to apologize to anyone whose name was incorrectly featured in the masthead of our last issue during this transitional period, and we ask that people who have, at some point in the past, been asked to be a part of the Scientific Editorial Board or to work with Hau in any capacity check if their name is appropriately listed or, indeed, if it should be listed at all.

As editors, we’re becoming even more attuned to its richness, and the complexities of pulling together such various formats and possibly even forms. HAU includes research articles submitted individually by authors from around the world, familiar to those in many anthropological journals, and subjected to a rigorous double-blind review process.Wehope toexpand thespacedevoted to individually submitted manuscripts in the future. We also include work that is not subject to editing or revision— such as the reprints of materials that are now hard to find, translations, distinguished lectures, and colloquia. We publish short reflections on current issues—the “shortcuts” sections, debates between two positions, and symposia on recently published books. Our hallmark, however, has always been the carefully curated and multiply reviewed special sections and special issues on provocative topics that are currently being debated or revisited in anthropology. We want to reiterate our call in the last issue for proposals for new and exciting formats from our readership. As readers, we drank deeply of these rich drafts; as editors, we are discovering the breadth of their sources, themany different technical requirements for their “brewing,” and the pleasure of watching them mature into our (now for a limited time) open-access publication. In the third issue of volume 8 (2018), HAU published the first half of a themed collection on “The Turn to Life.” The collection was wide-ranging in scope, from philosophical contemplations on the meaning of life itself (Pina-Cabral, Schrempp, Jackson) to ethnographic and personal explorations of “vitality” or the life-force as something that waxes and wanes (Singh), to asking how the anthropological canard of “everyday life” occurs at the conjunction of the social and the subjectivesubjunctive.

This study aims to broaden our understanding by examining the extent to which income trajectories in later stages of young adulthood are influenced by the work- and family-related pathways young people take into adulthood. The transition to adulthood is a demographically dense period, in which individuals make important decisions regarding their future career and family life, which in turn are likely to have a large impact on their future earnings. This study assesses to what extent the influence of family background, in terms of parental income, education, family structure and race, is mediated by the career and demographic pathways that youths choose during the transition to adulthood. It is examined to what extent incomes diverge between those opting for different pathways to adulthood and whether within groups choosing for the same pathway to adulthood, family background remains to have an influence on these income trajectories. This study uses panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths of 1997 (N=4966). Sequence analysis is used to define different career (based on education and employment) and demographic pathways (based on household, relationship and parenthood status) between age 17 and 25, separately for men and women. The family background variables and the different clusters are included as categorical variables in a growth curve model, with annual income between age 25 and 32 as the dependent variable. Results indicate that the effects of family background variables mostly disappear once the career and demographic clusters are included. Career pathways appear to be more important in explaining differences in income trajectories in early adulthood than demographic pathways. Incomes diverge for individuals who are in career clusters with longer college enrollment compared to those who are in clusters that have little college education.",,,empirical,,empirical,,

This is particularly true for the old age pension social insurance. The article investigates the question whether the continental European state show an in-built tendency towards illusions about their real wealth and the degree of their insuredness against old age poverty. It analyzes this tendency as welfare state in analogy to Ricardos public debt illusion. Since people act under the assumption of a constant population they tend to overestimate systematically the value of their accumulated claims to the social insurance. The value of their claims to the public pension system is indeed much lower under conditions of shrinking populations then they assume. This state illusion leads to the disappointment of expectations concerning the level of the old age pensions and to conflicts with the younger generation that has to work for the old age pensions. According to the author of the article, this question of the short term intergenerational justice of generations presently living is much more central then the question of justice towards future generations, a problem also often discussed under the label of intergenerational justice. Finally, the article also discusses the consequences of these developments for the global capital market as well as the importance of a transition to a system of capital funded old age pensions.",,,theoretical,,false,,

These advances are made possible by the recent digitization of historical censuses and new methods of historical record-linking, which have enabled researchers to create large historical samples of parent-child links. We identify three main findings. First, absolute mobility increased in the decades leading up to 1940 but has since declined, both in the US and other industrial countries. Second, recent studies on relative mobility question the classic narrative that the US has transitioned from a ""land of opportunity"" in the 19th century to a less mobile society today, suggesting that mobility was not as high in the past. However, estimates of relative mobility are sensitive to choices regarding sample selection and measurement. Third, we explore mechanisms underlying shifts in intergenerational mobility over time, including geographic mobility, wealth shocks, educational attainment, locational effects, and the transmission of parent-specific human capital. We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Error fetching abstract,,empirical,,empirical,,

Social factors such as gender, wealth, age and education levels generate differentiated abilities and capacities to cope with climate shocks. In this study we draw upon 48 sex disaggregated focus group discussions with youth to understand young people’s engagement in the livestock sector and their livestock adaptation strategies. We first explore whether gender and locational differences exist in young women’s and men’s engagement in the livestock sector, specifically which livestock species young women and men rear. Next, we describe young women’s and men’s livestock adaptation strategies in mixed crop and livestock and agropastoral systems. Lastly, we share insights about relationships that shape young women’s and men’s engagement in livestock during their transitions to adulthood. Youth rear certain species more than others, such as chickens and dairy cows. Livestock adaptation practices are generally low. Gendered practices during transitions to adulthood differ for young women and men and household relationships mediate young women’s and men’s livestock production engagement.

Social factors such as gender, wealth, age and education levels generate differentiated abilities and capacities to cope with climate shocks. In this study we draw upon 48 sex disaggregated focus group discussions with youth to understand young people’s engagement in the livestock sector and their livestock adaptation strategies. We first explore whether gender and locational differences exist in young women’s and men’s engagement in the livestock sector, specifically which livestock species young women and men rear. Next, we describe young women’s and men’s livestock adaptation strategies in mixed crop and livestock and agropastoral systems. Lastly, we share insights about relationships that shape young women’s and men’s engagement in livestock during their transitions to adulthood. Youth rear certain species more than others, such as chickens and dairy cows. Livestock adaptation practices are generally low. Gendered practices during transitions to adulthood differ for young women and men and household relationships mediate young women’s and men’s livestock production engagement.

We show that, for any given target of stationary stock of pollution, the land rent taxation scheme leads to a higher steady state capital accumulation than the other schemes, and hence the steady state consumption of agents when young under this scheme is also higher than under the others. In addition, under an ambitious mitigation target when the efficiency of the mitigation technology is relatively high compared to the dirtiness of production, the land rent taxation also provides a higher steady state consumption when old, resulting in higher social welfare, than the others. In the second part of the paper, we propose a period-by-period balanced budget policy, which includes land rent and capital income taxes with intergenerational transfers, to decentralize the socially optimal allocation during the transitional phase to the social planner's steady state.",Error fetching abstract,,false,,false,,https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/cesifo1_wp6937.pdf

We show the unintended redistributive intergenerational effects of a uniform contribution system and the consequences of switching from uniform policies to an actuarially fair system, first analytically in a stylized model with three overlapping generations. We then quantify these effects in a detailed model with multiple overlapping generations, realistic parameters and detailed information on the income distribution, calibrated on the Dutch funded pension system. The system implies a substantial transfer of income from poor to wealthy participants of about 10 billion euros. The gross aggregate transition effect of abolishing the uniform policy pension for an actuarially fair system is about 37 billion euros (5% of the Dutch GDP).

To achieve this goal, the transition matrix methodology is used in three domains: education, occupation, and income. The results show that the domain with the highest levels of mobility, in general terms, is education, and the lowest, income. Key findings reveal significant variations in the levels of social mobility across these domains depending on the studied country, such as in income mobility with respect to parents: Ethiopia is at the top with a high percentage of individuals experiencing upward mobility, and Malawi at the bottom, with a high percentage of individuals experiencing downward mobility. Moreover, the mobility levels of individuals tend to be higher for mothers than for fathers, which implies a greater improvement when compared to the most vulnerable group, i.e., women.

The intergenerational transfers from mid-age worker to their old parents act as a channel through which parents have incentive to invest in quantity and quality of children. A calibrated version of the model implies that exogenous fertility restrictions imposed by one-child policy increase expected years of schooling by 2.91 years on average during policy periods, and the resulting faster human capital accumulation would generate a annual gain of moderate 5.01% in GDP per worker decades after the policy enacted. Quantitative results also suggest that the policy decreases population growth by 1.23% points on average in 1980 − 2020, and generates large shift of population age structure during demographic transition from high to low fertility. When dependency ratio reaches the peak around 2030, the share of old-age dependents rises by 17.8% points and the share of mid-age workers decreases by 5.92% points, compared to the no-policy scenario. The theory also predicts that for poor regions who generally face more binding fertility restriction, the policy offered greater incentive to invest in children’s quality, leading to a temporarily faster income growth.",,,theoretical,,theoretical,,

human capital. The first essay looks at human capital from a growth perspective. Essays two and three focuses on the individual’s occupational decision and its relation to family background.The first essay attempts to capture the effects on long run economic growth and transitional dynamics of the interaction between human capital and R&D. We do this by allowing for endogenous human capital accumulation in an economy where the number of products and technologies expands because profit maximizing entrepreneurs do R&D. We find that, in the absence of scale effects, long run growth is determined by the economy’s capacity to accumulate human capital. A relative lack of R&D capital causes the economy to grow slowly during its transition to the steady state, while a relative abundance of R&D capital gives high growth rates during transition.In the second essay, the classical Roy-model of selection on the labor market is extended in order to analyze intergenerational mobility. This is done through the introduction of ability uncertainty that is linked to family background. In contrast to to additional human capital models of intergenerational mobility, this mechanism rather than differences in access to capital markets links occupational oucomes of offspring to parents. We study the effects of income redistribution on mobility and talent allocation. It is found that redistribution has implications for intergenerational mobility and talent allocation through its influence on individual occupational choices. However, we conclude that the presence of a trade-off between redistribution and intergenerational mobility depends on the extent of similarity of occupations with regard to ability sensitivity and wage rates, and on the degree of individual risk aversion. Whether redistribution occurs only within an occupation or simultaneously within and across occupations is also inportant for the implicatons for mobility and talent allocation.In essay three, a model of occupational choice and human capital investment is developmed and tested. The model allows family background to influence occupational choice through access to economic resources, differences in costs of schooling, and ability uncertainty linked to background similar to that discussed in essay two. It is predicted that life time utility of children from less well-off background is more sensitive to economic incentives when risk aversion is strong. The model also predicts that people are more sensitive to economic incentives when considering occupations distant from their parent occuations. The implications of the theoretical model are tested and largely confirmed on Swedish data using a mixed multinominal logit framework which explicitly accounts for unobserved ability heterogeneity.",,,both,,both,,

While most existing research has focused on the experiences of the migrants themselves, I am focused on how this influx of rural black migrants impacted outcomes for African Americans who were already living in the north and had already attained a modicum of economic success. Common themes throughout this dissertation involve the use of the complete-count U.S. population census to link records across years. In the first chapter, I linked northern-born blacks from 1910 to 1930 to study how the arrival of new black residents affected the employment outcomes of existing northern-born black residents. I find that southern black migrants served as both competitors and consumers to northern-born blacks in the labor market. In the second chapter, my co-authors and I study the role of segregated housing markets in eroding black wealth during the Great Migration. Building a new sample of matched census addresses from 1930 to 1940, we find that racial transition on a block was associated with both soaring rental prices and declines in the sales value of homes. In other words, black families paid more to rent housing and faced falling values of homes they were able to purchase. Finally, the third chapter compares the rates of intergenerational occupational mobility by both race and region. I find that racial mobility difference in the North was more substantial than it was in the South. However, regional mobility difference for blacks is greater than any gap in intergenerational mobility by race in prewar American. Therefore, the first Great Migration helped blacks successfully translate their geographic mobility into economic mobility.",,,empirical,,empirical,,

A large number of studies in family sociology and gerontology demonstrate the explanatory power of micro-level variables, but the effect of the socio-cultural context on intergenerational arrangements rarely has been appraised. A comprehensive review of prominent classifications of European family and welfare regimes prompts the main research question: Do these macro-level typologies add heuristic value to the investigation of intergenerational arrangements in contemporary Europe? Further, as previous studies have focused mainly on Western Europe alone, Eastern European countries are included using comparable micro-data from the first wave of the Generations and Gender Survey (UNO, 2005). Launched and coordinated by the UNECE, the GGS panel survey was carried out between 2004 and 2010. Within each participating country nationally representative samples of the 18-79 year old resident population are conducted under the direction of national experts and institutions. For a selection of West and (South) East European countries the frequency of face-to-face contact of respondents aged 60 years and older to their adult children is explored. Controlling for several individual-level characteristics, significant country differences remain. A west-east division coincides with a less stark north-south division. Contact is most frequent in Georgia and Bulgaria; it is lower in Estonia, the Russian Federation, and Germany and lowest in France. Belgium, with its very high contact rate, is an exceptional case. KEYWORDS: intergenerational contact, kinship system, welfare regime, cross- national comparison, Generations and Gender Survey, Europe INTRODUCTION In the field of family sociology and social gerontology there is a plethora of studies that seek to explain intergenerational solidarity in advanced stages of relationships using micro-level variables. Most studies investigate opportunities and resources - such as geographic proximity or money - useful in maintaining specific (support) arrangements. The structure of needs, shaped by physical health for example, is especially examined. Other issues include the quality of the relationship, the history of intergenerational transfers within the relationship, and the strength of intergenerational obligation norms (e.g., Cox, 1987; Kalmijn, 2005; Katz et al., 2003; Klaus, 2009; Kohli & Kunemund, 2003; Parrott & Bengtson, 1999; Silverstein, Parrott, & Bengtson, 1995; Stuifbergen, van Delden, & Dykstra, 2008). Although countries differ in social, institutional, and cultural terms, large- scale contextual differences have rarely received attention in the literature on intergenerational solidarity. For Europe, well-known country typologies underscore that there is a considerable diversity in terms of the mode and scope of social benefit provision (e.g., Esping-Andersen, 1990). Countries differ, too, with regard to the long-standing family cultures in which intergenerational arrangements are embedded (e.g., Hajnal, 1965). Some recent comparative studies explore the implications of national socio-cultural settings for intergenerational relationships, but most of them focus on Western Europe countries only. Despite the fact that Eastern Europe differs significantly from Western Europe in at least two significant aspects, researchers have largely neglected including them in these comparative studies. First, the last decades have brought about tremendous social, economic, and political changes in the formerly socialist countries. Before their collapse in the early 1990s, Eastern Europe was characterized by planned economies and rather reliable welfare states. Although average real incomes were modest, Eastern Europeans did enjoy basic financial protection in retirement and in case of illness. Since the collapse of socialism, East European countries have experienced a profound transition to market economic systems in which welfare transfers have become both less reliable and less comprehensive. …",,,false,,false,,

This study uses unique data on the children and grandchildren of immigrants and native Dutch (‘third generation’) in 2018 to assess whether and how the descendants of large immigrant groups from the postwar era have attained ownership. The generational perspective is two-fold. First, we are interested in how individuals from various generations compare within and between origin groups (generational comparison). Second, the study also assesses the role of parental wealth and tenure in intergenerational transfers, i.e., ethnic and generational differences in the effects of these parental background variables. Our estimates from logistic regression models show that Surinamese-Dutch and Turkish-Dutch see higher predicted owner-occupation rates over generations, with some Turkish-Dutch groups having higher rates than native-Dutch. The parental background variables partly predict owner-occupation rates and explain group differences, which indicates the importance of generational transfers.",,W. van Gent; Aslan Zorlu,empirical,,empirical,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10901-024-10125-6.pdf

and collective bargaining: o It strengthens awareness of the specific labour market positions and needs of both younger and older workers. o It supports social partners’ role in unifying generations of workers - also as a response to public opinion and the risk of ‘generational conflicts’ or age related outsiderness in the labour market and in employment relations. o It fosters ‘positive-sum’ bargaining by combining and interlinking age related capacities, knowledge and skills and integrated approaches in lifecycle policies (from school-to-work transitions to retirement transition, and all working life phases in between). This project has resulted in a better understanding of the social partners’ reasons to strive for a better integration of the policies and strategies for younger and older workers through collective bargaining and social dialogue. The social partners’ opportunities to improve the labour market and employment situation and working conditions for both groups are dependent on the national contexts of industrial relations systems, such as the cooperative structures between governments and collective bargaining parties and the scope of dialogue and bargaining between employers and trade unions (especially where the integration of issues of the quality of employment, training and education, health and working conditions is concerned). This research project has also shown that the Europe-wide crisis has been an enabling factor in promoting intergenerational or age related public policies, although they did not emerge immediately when the crisis started: the bigger public initiatives in the country reports were implemented several years after the onset of the crisis: the French Contrat de generation was implemented in 2012 and the Dutch Generatiepact in 2013. Both public programmes reinforced the governmental approach of not using early retirement schemes for older workers as a policy instrument in solving the problem of youth unemployment (the main intergenerational ‘trade-off’ during the last three decades of the 20th century). We expect continuing political and public attention to the employment participation of both groups, because of the risk that the workers at the beginning as well as at the end of the working lives run to be used as ‘adjustment’ variables in flexible labour markets. The research results indeed suggest that the old intergenerational ‘trade-off’ - that is, redistributing employment from the older to the newer generations of workers - has disappeared as an important topic in collective bargaining. At the same time, however, the labour market and company practices in some sectors of industry can push for, or generate, a redistribution of jobs towards cheaper or more recently educated workers, for example in the retail industry (in which the labour market is more constituted as a ‘lump sum’), the IT sector (in which the older workers’ skills risk becoming obsolete) or in physically demanding workplaces. More tailor-made collective bargaining on investments in skills, health, task differentiation and cross-sector job-to-job policies are needed to prevent unemployment and sickness in later working life phases. For some groups, however, we expect in both the short and the longer run that the social partners in Europe will increase their bargaining activities on the issue of part-time work and flexible and gradual retirement among older workers. These negotiations will deal with regulating compensation for income loss and the needs of older workers themselves, although cost reduction of senior workers’ labour costs will also play a role. The take up of these reduced working hours of the older workers by younger workers can be directly or indirectly addressed in collective bargaining. The relevant case studies in this project (in particular Italy and the Netherlands) have taught us that combining part-time retirement for older workers with new jobs for youths can be both enabled or hindered by the financial compensation for the older worker. A remarkable finding in this project is that the social partners in all countries (with the possible exception of the UK) have intensified their debates - and sometimes initiated regulations - on the topic of intergeneration transfers of knowledge and skills by involving older workers as mentors, coaches, trainers or instructors for young workers at workplaces, vocational education organizations or in other school-to-work trajectories. Reserving these kinds of tasks for workers in the final phase of their working careers is a valuable option to enable longer working careers for older workers, knowledge management in organizations, and recognizing and appreciating the skills, insights and values of experienced workers (see also Cedefop, 2009; Delay et al., 2011; Jubany et al., 2014). Coordination through collective bargaining and the involvement of trade unions can have a supporting and promoting function for these kind of innovations at the workplace, as we have seen in France, Germany and the Netherlands. We can also conclude that the collective bargaining parties in most of the case studies seem not to refer to frames and concepts on ‘intergenerational solidarity’, or to ‘intergenerational conflicts’, when discussing or negotiating age related employment or working conditions. Social partners in many case studies address the specific, work related needs of both younger and older workers, without bargaining on intergenerational ‘trade-offs’. This can be done through approaches targeting specific age groups in labour market policies and in collective agreements (Sweden, Netherlands, France, Germany), or through an approach in which the needs and interests of youths or older workers are addressed in age neutral, general regulations (UK). Nevertheless, some tensions between age groups are signalled in some of the country reports, for example regarding the negotiations on the austerity measures in older workers’ provisions and their conversion into new provisions for workers in all working career phases in the Netherlands. In this case we have seen negotiations along the intergenerational redistributive logic that does not concern employment but a distribution of terms and conditions of employment. Another complex case dealing with intergenerational solidarity is that of the debates in German firms about age group related priorities in HR policies and the related distributive decisions in the context of the demography related funds and framework agreements. These tensions and dialogues between generations of workers can be better moderated when young workers are more organized by trade unions and when they are given a stronger voice in trade unions’ decisions and actions. Intergenerational bargaining approaches and activities are challenged by the ageing memberships of trade unions in Europe (Keune, 2015). Vandaele (2012) concludes that youth representatives across Europe find their confederations’ responsiveness and commitment to organizing younger workers inadequate. Trade unions are only to a limited extent adapting their internal policies and strategies to support young people and engage the new generation of workers in their activities and decision-making structures. Besides the more targeted logic of organizing intergenerational learning in collective bargaining, and the more political dependent logic of public employment policies for youth and older workers, we think that bargaining along the lifecycle logic is a promising approach in collective bargaining, because of its ambition and ability to respond to - and to anticipate - the specific and changing needs of workers in work-life phases and during their careers, from the school-to-work transition to the work-retirement transition. Such an approach can include topics on the quality of work and employment, health issues, training, job design or redesign, and work-life balance to foster an improved labour market inclusion of youth workers and higher quality working career extensions for older workers. The biggest challenge in this approach is to extend it to workers in less organized sectors and to those with less stable career patterns.",,,false,,false,,

Although a common practice for public sector pension plans in many countries, this is not actuarially fair because the investment horizon of young participants is longer than the investment horizon of the elderly. We show the unintended redistributive intergenerational effects of a uniform contribution system and the consequences of switching from uniform policies to an actuarially fair system, first analytically in a stylized model with three overlapping generations. We then quantify these effects in a detailed model with multiple overlapping generations, realistic parameters and detailed information on the income distribution, calibrated on the Dutch funded pension system. Our base estimate shows that the transition effect of abolishing uniform policies for an actuarially fair system is about 37 billion euros (5% of the Dutch GDP) for an interest rate of 1% (the market interest rate ultimo 2017), but only 11 billion euro for an interest rate of 0% (the market interest rate as of July 2019). For each cohort, the redistributive effects are less than 5% of their total pension. We show that a system with uniform policies implies a transfer of about 10 billion euros from poor to rich.",,Damiaan H. J. Chen; Sweder J.

place.This paper, which is an exploratory study in its nature, aims to identify and systematize the existing rules regulating family business (family crafts and family business corporations), with an emphasis put on the standards regulating family business succession.Key substantive tax acts, procedural rules as contained in the Tax Procedure Code, basic accounting regulation rules and regulation in the area of social and health insurance premiums were under investigation in this respect.The results of the conducted research prove that the Czech law-making body has not established a preferential tax regime for entities meeting the characteristics of a family business as currently defined in the Governmental Resolution of the Czech Republic.Some preferential clauses for family business as such can be, however, found in the Income Tax Act, which increasingly operates with family ties as one of the criteria for achieving certain tax benefits.In the context of the focus and the results presented therein, this paper can be seen and used as a basis for further research in the area of family business, focusing on the transition/transfer of a family business from the

on the distribution of incomes in Western economies. This paper compares and contrasts in this respect American financialization with German over the past half-century. According to Petra Dunhaupt, finanzialization in the two countries differed: “In the US, the important shift towards financialization occurred in the early 1980s, …in Germany the process of financialization started much later – in the beginning of the 1990s – and followed a much more gradual transition.” (Dunhaupt, 2012, 1) The analysis is pursued historically, on the grounds that an understanding of the financialization of the German economy requires an investigation of intergenerational institutional legacies. The financialization referred to here can be described as the transition from management capitalism to finance capitalism. More specifically, it is the change from viewing a business as a vehicle for earning “returns on investment . . . based on the value created by productive enterprise” to viewing a business “as assets to be bought and sold for maximizing profits through financial strategies.” (Ball & Appelbaum, 2) Large-scale industrial organizations in which the internal “visible hand” of management orchestrated productive activities formerly coordinated through the external “invisible hand” of market transactions first emerged in the United States in the 19 th century. By the 1920s, many of these organizations, as famously described by Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. in his path-breaking book The Visible Hand ,1977, (Locke & Spender, 2011) had evolved into complex multi-divisional enterprises that arguably represent the pinnacle of management capitalism’s development. Indeed, large managed enterprises have flourished in the global economy from the early 20 th century to today. But changes in financial markets, financial institutions, and management compensation after the 1960s increasingly shifted the attention of managers from producing and selling products and non-financial services to seeking returns from financial activities. These changes from management capitalism to finance capitalism had profound consequences for the distribution of incomes. However, the fairness of that distribution varied greatly from nation to nation, depending on their institutional and governance forms and how democratically members of each society could alter those forms. Here we particularly examine how institutional and governance differences shaped outcomes in Germany and the United States.",,,false,,false,,

parts. The first part analyzes the possibility and duration of a Pareto-improving pension reform. The second part considers some economic issues related to the tax avoidance activities. The possibility and duration of a Pareto-improving pension reform.Many countries face large problems in supporting current pay-as-you-go pension systems arising from demographic changes leading to the situation when returns on capital exceed population growth. Inefficiency arises from implicit taxation on pension contributions. In a closed economy, it is even more destructive due to its negative impact on savings and capital accumulation. Although the transition to a fully funded system is a great improvement of the economy, its implementation entails several difficulties if Pareto-efficiency is required. The first essay, “The Possibility of a Pareto Improving Pension Reform in a Heterogeneous Economy”, demonstrates that Pareto-improving transitions from pay-as-you-go to fully funded pension systems nearly always exist. To demonstrate this, I classify existing theoretical results according to the type of reformed economy, the form of pension benefits, and the policy instruments used during the transition. Then, I show that intergenerational heterogeneity should no longer be considered as an obstacle when implementing Pareto-improving pension reforms. To maintain redistributive or insurance mechanisms supported by pay-as-you-go systems, I propose to replace inefficient social security with redistributive tax and transfer payments inside one generation. This would save the economy from the inefficiency related to the implicit taxes on pension contributions imposed by pay-as-you-go systems. The second essay, “Designing Optimal Pareto Improving Pension Reforms: A More Distorted Economy Can be Reformed Faster”, investigates the optimal Pareto-improving debt-financed transition from pay-as-you-go to fully funded pension systems. In particular, I examine the relationship between key parameter values characterizing the preferences, the technology and the size of the initial system, and the necessary time for a Pareto-improving transition. My finding is that a more distorted economy can be reformed faster. This result gives an additional explanation to the success of the Chilean reform, where an initial pay-as-you-go system was the largest and, at the same time, the most distorting.An Economy with Clever Tax Avoidance Providers.In the third essay “The Importance of Income Distribution for the Price of the Tax Avoidance Service”, I design a model with a clever tax avoidance provider, who maximizes a profit by setting the price for the tax avoidance services. Therefore, the price for the tax avoidance service is endogenously defined. In that setup, the change in income distribution is not less important than changes in the tax code, which together are responsible for the tax avoidance demand. The model has a wide range of applications. In particular, I analyze the relation between inequality and the collection of tax revenue. The paper shows that tax revenue as a percentage of GDP might grow with inequality when the tax code is not significantly changed. Moreover, higher inequality implies lower marginal cost of additional revenue. This assay also considers tax base broadening, providing examples where this leads to a reduction in tax revenue.In the fourth essay, “ Tax Avoidance as a Reason for Secession”, I provide an additional explanation for the intentions to secede related to expected changes in the tax codes after the ''break down of a nation''. To demonstrate my points, I use a tax avoidance model designed in the third essay, where active tax avoidance providers make a decision about the price and quantity of their services. Secession gives the avoidance provider the option of setting different prices in separate regions. As a consequence, the price for the tax avoidance service may fall in the poorer region and the elite of this region would be able to avoid the tax, which is impossible in union. Moreover, regional separation may lead to tremendous changes in the shape of income distribution, forcing new governments to change the tax codes. Thus, the government of the richer region may reduce tax rates in order to enlarge the tax revenue collection. To avoid a breakdown of the state, the government should reduce inefficient spending and tax duties. Promoting democracy or increasing the political influence of poor households may reduce the tendency to separate.",,,false,,false,,

parts. The first part analyzes the possibility and duration of a Pareto-improving pension reform. The second part considers some economic issues related to the tax avoidance activities. The possibility and duration of a Pareto-improving pension reform.Many countries face large problems in supporting current pay-as-you-go pension systems arising from demographic changes leading to the situation when returns on capital exceed population growth. Inefficiency arises from implicit taxation on pension contributions. In a closed economy, it is even more destructive due to its negative impact on savings and capital accumulation. Although the transition to a fully funded system is a great improvement of the economy, its implementation entails several difficulties if Pareto-efficiency is required. The first essay, “The Possibility of a Pareto Improving Pension Reform in a Heterogeneous Economy”, demonstrates that Pareto-improving transitions from pay-as-you-go to fully funded pension systems nearly always exist. To demonstrate this, I classify existing theoretical results according to the type of reformed economy, the form of pension benefits, and the policy instruments used during the transition. Then, I show that intergenerational heterogeneity should no longer be considered as an obstacle when implementing Pareto-improving pension reforms. To maintain redistributive or insurance mechanisms supported by pay-as-you-go systems, I propose to replace inefficient social security with redistributive tax and transfer payments inside one generation. This would save the economy from the inefficiency related to the implicit taxes on pension contributions imposed by pay-as-you-go systems. The second essay, “Designing Optimal Pareto Improving Pension Reforms: A More Distorted Economy Can be Reformed Faster”, investigates the optimal Pareto-improving debt-financed transition from pay-as-you-go to fully funded pension systems. In particular, I examine the relationship between key parameter values characterizing the preferences, the technology and the size of the initial system, and the necessary time for a Pareto-improving transition. My finding is that a more distorted economy can be reformed faster. This result gives an additional explanation to the success of the Chilean reform, where an initial pay-as-you-go system was the largest and, at the same time, the most distorting.An Economy with Clever Tax Avoidance Providers.In the third essay “The Importance of Income Distribution for the Price of the Tax Avoidance Service”, I design a model with a clever tax avoidance provider, who maximizes a profit by setting the price for the tax avoidance services. Therefore, the price for the tax avoidance service is endogenously defined. In that setup, the change in income distribution is not less important than changes in the tax code, which together are responsible for the tax avoidance demand. The model has a wide range of applications. In particular, I analyze the relation between inequality and the collection of tax revenue. The paper shows that tax revenue as a percentage of GDP might grow with inequality when the tax code is not significantly changed. Moreover, higher inequality implies lower marginal cost of additional revenue. This assay also considers tax base broadening, providing examples where this leads to a reduction in tax revenue.In the fourth essay, “ Tax Avoidance as a Reason for Secession”, I provide an additional explanation for the intentions to secede related to expected changes in the tax codes after the ''break down of a nation''. To demonstrate my points, I use a tax avoidance model designed in the third essay, where active tax avoidance providers make a decision about the price and quantity of their services. Secession gives the avoidance provider the option of setting different prices in separate regions. As a consequence, the price for the tax avoidance service may fall in the poorer region and the elite of this region would be able to avoid the tax, which is impossible in union. Moreover, regional separation may lead to tremendous changes in the shape of income distribution, forcing new governments to change the tax codes. Thus, the government of the richer region may reduce tax rates in order to enlarge the tax revenue collection. To avoid a breakdown of the state, the government should reduce inefficient spending and tax duties. Promoting democracy or increasing the political influence of poor households may reduce the tendency to separate.",,,false,,false,,

parts. The first part analyzes the possibility and duration of a Pareto-improving pension reform. The second part considers some economic issues related to the tax avoidance activities. The possibility and duration of a Pareto-improving pension reform.Many countries face large problems in supporting current pay-as-you-go pension systems arising from demographic changes leading to the situation when returns on capital exceed population growth. Inefficiency arises from implicit taxation on pension contributions. In a closed economy, it is even more destructive due to its negative impact on savings and capital accumulation. Although the transition to a fully funded system is a great improvement of the economy, its implementation entails several difficulties if Pareto-efficiency is required. The first essay, “The Possibility of a Pareto Improving Pension Reform in a Heterogeneous Economy”, demonstrates that Pareto-improving transitions from pay-as-you-go to fully funded pension systems nearly always exist. To demonstrate this, I classify existing theoretical results according to the type of reformed economy, the form of pension benefits, and the policy instruments used during the transition. Then, I show that intergenerational heterogeneity should no longer be considered as an obstacle when implementing Pareto-improving pension reforms. To maintain redistributive or insurance mechanisms supported by pay-as-you-go systems, I propose to replace inefficient social security with redistributive tax and transfer payments inside one generation. This would save the economy from the inefficiency related to the implicit taxes on pension contributions imposed by pay-as-you-go systems. The second essay, “Designing Optimal Pareto Improving Pension Reforms: A More Distorted Economy Can be Reformed Faster”, investigates the optimal Pareto-improving debt-financed transition from pay-as-you-go to fully funded pension systems. In particular, I examine the relationship between key parameter values characterizing the preferences, the technology and the size of the initial system, and the necessary time for a Pareto-improving transition. My finding is that a more distorted economy can be reformed faster. This result gives an additional explanation to the success of the Chilean reform, where an initial pay-as-you-go system was the largest and, at the same time, the most distorting.An Economy with Clever Tax Avoidance Providers.In the third essay “The Importance of Income Distribution for the Price of the Tax Avoidance Service”, I design a model with a clever tax avoidance provider, who maximizes a profit by setting the price for the tax avoidance services. Therefore, the price for the tax avoidance service is endogenously defined. In that setup, the change in income distribution is not less important than changes in the tax code, which together are responsible for the tax avoidance demand. The model has a wide range of applications. In particular, I analyze the relation between inequality and the collection of tax revenue. The paper shows that tax revenue as a percentage of GDP might grow with inequality when the tax code is not significantly changed. Moreover, higher inequality implies lower marginal cost of additional revenue. This assay also considers tax base broadening, providing examples where this leads to a reduction in tax revenue.In the fourth essay, “ Tax Avoidance as a Reason for Secession”, I provide an additional explanation for the intentions to secede related to expected changes in the tax codes after the ''break down of a nation''. To demonstrate my points, I use a tax avoidance model designed in the third essay, where active tax avoidance providers make a decision about the price and quantity of their services. Secession gives the avoidance provider the option of setting different prices in separate regions. As a consequence, the price for the tax avoidance service may fall in the poorer region and the elite of this region would be able to avoid the tax, which is impossible in union. Moreover, regional separation may lead to tremendous changes in the shape of income distribution, forcing new governments to change the tax codes. Thus, the government of the richer region may reduce tax rates in order to enlarge the tax revenue collection. To avoid a breakdown of the state, the government should reduce inefficient spending and tax duties. Promoting democracy or increasing the political influence of poor households may reduce the tendency to separate.",,,false,,false,,

The latter events were sparked by the May 25, 2020 videotaped killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer casually kneeling on his neck and prone body for eight minutes and forty-six seconds. It echoed similar documented episodes of police violence and chokeholds before this event, and sparked the reporting of many other undocumented ones. Coming as it did on a major American holiday, and at a time in which media consumption was heightened by COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders in many states—and in which information was emerging about the health disparities in this disease's impact—this event catalyzed a response that continues unabated at the time of this writing, in towns large and small, by people of color and their allies demanding the vital right to breathe.We acknowledge the global Black Lives Matter movement and the many protests that manifest commitment to its values by a vast range of demographic groups with our cover for this issue, an image of one of the many events rallying people in the streets to this cause. We reiterate, too, our stance in favor of more inclusive publication and citation practices, outlined in our first editorial (see Ferme, Costa, and Durham 2019), which have informed our work in the intervening time. Anthropologists have responded with reflections on the legacies of racism and white supremacy in various institutional settings and in framing concepts, including in our flagship journals. In particular, there has been a demand to ""say the name"" of the victims of these brutalities, and to engage in specific practices of memorialization on their behalf, paralleled by a corollary call for deleting or relegating to the background other names and icons linked to an odious and discriminatory history. Prominent institutions and universities have announced the renaming of buildings memorializing racist individuals, and protesters or municipal bodies have removed statues and other historical markers associated with legacies of white supremacy in different parts of the postcolonial world. We have invited the organization of a Currents section devoted to racialized institutional violence and policing in the United States and elsewhere for an upcoming issue, and welcome inquiries from scholars with expertise on these topics to contact us if they are interested in joining the project. We also will be devoting a Colloquium in our next issue to repatriation and iconoclasm, occasioned by dialogues between President Emmanuel Macron and African intellectuals over the repatriation of objects taken from the continent and housed in French museums.In these troubled times, we are especially pleased to publish last fall's Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture, delivered by Laurence Ralph at the University of Rochester. Its title, ""Black Cargo,"" inspired by the subtitle to Zora Neale Hurston's Barracoon (2018), disrupts the conventional referent—enslaved Africans forcibly transported to the Americas as ship cargo. Instead, the lecture focuses on the hidden cargo within enslaved Africans, the rich trove of stories transmitted intergenerationally in oral folklore within families and broader communities. The occasion for Ralph's exploration of African American storytelling—a tradition strengthened by the prohibition against the formal education of enslaved people—was the belated and posthumous publication of Hurston's Barracoon. The book was based on Hurston's conversations with Cudjo Lewis (formerly named Kossula), purportedly the last survivor of the schooner Clotilda, which in 1860 secretly brought to the vicinity of Mobile, Alabama, a cargo of more than a hundred enslaved Africans, fifty-two years after slave transports to the United States had been banned.In the book, Hurston is attentive to the meandering nature of actual storytelling, and does not elide the detours taken by Lewis's narrative, which makes it sometimes difficult for a reader to follow. She also alludes to the context that led to the book's production—a palimpsestic bookend, as a posthumous publication, to a scholarly career that was inaugurated with the appearance in print of her first article, ""Cudjo's own story of the last African slaver"" (1927), about the very same man. In Hurston's memoir ([1942] 2006), in the book, and in the various writings prompted by its belated ""rediscovery"" and publication, reference is made to the accusation of plagiarism following the publication of the article that prompted this young scholar to return to the story, revisiting Cudjo Lewis, expanding her research, and writing more at length on the topic (see Cep 2018; Sexton 2003: 190). Thus the vicissitudes of Hurston's first and posthumous work on the life of Cudjo Lewis also serve as an exemplary story of self-improvement and scholarly apprenticeship, while laying bare the unusual pressure under which she labored, as an underfunded scholar of color, to publish the results of her sponsored research projects. Concurrently, the differences between her article and book on the same subject underscore the ways in which, over the arc of her career, Hurston became more assertive in developing an alternative authorial voice, to disrupt the strictures of more formal academic writing under which she labored at the beginning of her scholarship.Laurence Ralph uses Barracoon, and Hurston's gift for immersing her readers in the everyday speech of common African American people in the South, telling stories, fibbing, and provoking each other, as a model for his own ""ethnographic journey"" among Black Chicago residents subject to racist police violence. His storytelling also explores the broader history of policing in America. In his own narrative, which explores the possibilities of different forms of witnessing, Ralph's focus is on Black Chicagoans' perceptions of the police, told by his interlocutors—here, primarily an activist-teacher he calls Kenya Davis. In her storytelling, Kenya tacks back and forth between her own experiences of encounters with ""the law,"" and signal events in the city's policing of African Americans, particularly the shooting (sixteen times) of Laquan McDonald in 2014 by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke. Kenya's coming-of-age as an activist in the Chicago Black community is narrated by her in relation to these events, which inform her and her community's ""nervousness"" any time the police are around. In his own artful storytelling, Ralph interweaves testimony from Van Dyke's trial transcripts with historical material that highlights the racialized fantasies informing this nervousness and mutual fears. Threaded throughout Ralph's storytelling is an exploration of American debates around the use of excessive force by the police as far back as eighteenth-century Louisiana, with the organization of slave patrols to pursue ""fugitive"" slaves and thus allay white fears of slave revolts, partly encapsulated in the legendary status of Bras-Coupé in African American folklore.We also publish in this issue the annual Claude Lévi-Strauss Memorial Lecture, delivered in October 2019 by Heonik Kwon in Paris. The lecture engages closely with Lévi-Strauss's work for UNESCO, particularly his essay on Rousseau and the notion advanced there of anthropology's role in calling for world peace following World War II, inspired by Kant's essay, ""Perpetual peace: A philosophical essay."" Through the lens of UNESCO's proximity to anthropology and its role as a source of support for the work of anthropologists during the Cold War, Kwon reminds us of two key historical processes following World War II: decolonization, and the concurrent power shift away from Europe and towards North America that inaugurated the so-called ""American Century."" In a parallel move, anthropologists turned from a preoccupation with kinship and its role in articulating politics and organizing alliances—central to Lévi-Strauss's work—to a focus on the nation and national cultures.In another important essay occasioned by his work for UNESCO, ""Race and history"" ([1952] 1976), Lévi-Strauss had further made an impassioned plea against racial thinking, by juxtaposing it with cultural diversity. Since ""there are many more human cultures than there are human races,"" he argued, and ""two cultures developed by men belonging to the same race may differ as much, or more, than two cultures belonging to racially distant groups"" (Lévi-Strauss 1976: 325), it follows that cultural differences, and not racial ones, should be the focus of attention, and in this anthropology leads the way among the social sciences, particularly because of its critical stance towards ethnocentrism. This call for the subordination of race to culture reads as somewhat anachronistic today, in the face of demands that institutional, systemic forms of racism be critically acknowledged and foregrounded, along with their banalized effects on everyday livelihoods in the form, for example, of health, economic, and educational disparities, and life expectancy. But other aspects of Lévi-Strauss's essay on race and history maintain their relevance, such as the notion that most cultures exhibit some form of ethnocentrism, or ""the pure and simple repudiation of cultural forms … which are the most removed from those with which we identify"" (ibid.: 328). He also pointed out that all-encompassing concepts such as ""humanity,"" which are frequently deployed by internationalist organizations like UNESCO and the United Nations in their programmatic statements, and which do not distinguish by race or civilization, appeared very recently in our history.We dedicate the first Currents collection of this issue to the Hong Kong protests that began in 2019, and led, at the end of June 2020, to the passage of a new security law by the Chinese central government, which will curtail significantly such activities in the future. From the perspective of the Euro-American left, the 2019 protests in Hong Kong refract global politics through a disturbing lens. On the one hand, a hopeful celebration of democratic principles and the freedoms of expression and assembly seem to defy a global authoritarian trend. On the other hand, the protesters' nativism seems uncomfortably similar to that of anti-immigrant political forces in pro-Brexit England, pro-Trump America, Le Pen's France, and Orban's Hungary. In the ethnic politics of the West, how can one make sense of accusations that Hong Kong protesters are anti-Chinese racists? What can be said to those who see Chinese power as the only alternative to Euro-American hegemony? In this issue, eight anthropologists who live and work in Hong Kong wrestle with the deeply felt political emotions they experienced during the 2019 Hong Kong protests. Andrew B. Kipnis, from the editorial collective, examines the disjuncture between the politics and the lived experiences of one group of immigrants from Mainland China to Hong Kong; Ho Wing Chung and Hung Choi Man describe how the education system and everyday life in Hong Kong generate feelings of hatred for Mainland China among Hong Kong youth; Minhua Ling depicts how recent Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong live separate and discordant lives from long-term Hong Kong residents, and discusses the role of social media systems in exacerbating this separation; Jun Zhang analyzes the legacies of British colonialism in the social and political inequalities of contemporary Hong Kong and the ways in which these legacies are ignored in the rush to blame China for all of Hong Kong's ills; Ka-ming Wu scrutinizes the links between the political emotions of the protests and the transportation infrastructure of Hong Kong, demonstrating how the experience of infrastructure is never politically or emotionally neutral; David Palmer explores the excesses of racism and violence in the protests and their relation to Cold War-style Western fears of Chinese dominance; and, finally, Pun Ngai critically dissects the tactics and visions of the protesters from the perspective of a labor organizer. These seven perspectives on the protests reveal considerable divergence in the social and political vantage points of the authors. As in the fable of the blind men and the elephant, their descriptions seem to involve very different aspects of a whole, but, unlike the fable, ways in which the constitutive elements might at least partially fit together can also be imagined. As mainland China imposes its ""National Security Law"" on Hong Kong, the protests may finally come to an end; the people of Hong Kong may become as quiet as Uighurs in Xinjiang. But such a silence makes the academic reflection on these protests all the more crucial.While democracy in the former colonial power, Britain, might be idealized in the context of Hong Kong, the second Currents section reveals how far such political imaginaries are from actuality. It focuses on ethnographic and autoethnographic ramifications of Britain's exit (Brexit) from the European Union (EU) based on a closely won referendum result in 2016. The outcome has since been converted to the ""people's vote"" to push through what have been described as antipeople measures to stop public scrutiny and debate. This included attempts to legislate ""Henry VIIIth powers"" that would have allowed cabinet ministers to amend laws without a parliamentary vote, the proroguing of parliament to stop ministers conferring, and, subsequently, backroom video and socially distanced conferencing with European and other leaders while public attention is focused on the COVID-19 pandemic.Brexit realities and tribalist politics have had momentous implications for how democracy is imagined, executed and—ironically—challenged as ""anti-democratic."" January 31, 2020, was declared Brexit Day, heralding a year-long transition to forge new relationships with the EU among other world regions—""deal or no deal."" In a divided nation, this was a major event for those who applauded Britain's withdrawal as if they had received independence from oppressive powers. For others, it was a nonevent, or even a disturbing harbinger of British isolationism, undermining the decades-long experiment of a united Europe, with grave implications for the future. The Currents contributors note the (re)interpretation of histories, presents, and futures in navigating ""everyday Brexits"" (Anderson et al. 2019: 2)—once only an imaginary neologism, now part of ruthless political realities. They consider Brexit certainties and uncertainties as they affect minorities in the UK, as well as the English as they become a minority outside of the UK. Raminder Kaur, from the editorial collective, brings an intersectional lens on Brexit phenomena, while noting the ways in which Brexit resurrects ""more of the same"" empire-pride and xenophobia. Ethiraj Gabriel Dattatreyan focuses on Brexit-inflected conversations on race, racism, and anti-racism in British higher education with an ethnography of his university in southeast London. Morteza Hashemi highlights how Scottish Shia Muslims mobilized civic engagement and reinterpreted Shia history for strategies of survival in a hostile, Islamophobic environment. Daniel Miller observes a fundamental shift in Irish perceptions of the English, leading to a re-examination of colonial legacies with respect to the former colonial power. Felix Ringel asks what is Brexit(s) as an ethnographic object, while arguing for the need of an anthropology of the future with respect to life in the postindustrial era, based on his fieldwork and experiences in Germany and northeast England.In the article by Sergio Jarillo, Allan Darrah, Carlos Crivelli, Camillus Mkwesipu, Kenneth Kalubaku, Nagia Toyagena, Gumwemwata Okwala, and Justin Gumwemwata, we wrestle with some of the fundamental issues of the discipline in one of anthropology's primordial locations: the Trobriand Islands. At first glance, the Colloquium is about the specific contents of belief in spirits and their reincarnation among Trobriand Islanders. But the commentaries by Francesca Merlan, Michelle MacCarthy, and Mark Mosko, and the response by the authors of the original article, bring forth a slew of questions. What is at stake in the category of belief? Whose beliefs matter? How are beliefs individual and how are they collective? What is the relation of one belief to another? Of belief to wider social institutions? Of belief to ritual? Of belief to authority? Of belief to power? What sort of methodologies can answer these questions and how do differences in methodological approach relate to anthropological beliefs about belief? Such questions have reverberated in many anthropological settings. They echo in Talal Asad's (1993) critique of Clifford Geertz's (1973) definition of religion, where Asad accused Geertz of using a modern Western category, in which the place of ""belief"" loomed large, to distort our understandings of places and times where belief was unimportant. They are also discernible in the debate between Evelyn S. Rawski and James L. Watson (1988) over whether it was ""orthodoxy"" or ""orthopraxy"" that mattered most to the imperial Chinese regime in the conduct of funerals. But one of the earliest places where such questions were addressed was in the Malinowskian corpus on the Trobriand Islands. These questions inform later ethnographies on the Trobriands (Lepani 2012; Mosko 2017; Weiner 1976) and reach a new apex in this issue's symposium.This issue's second colloquium is organized by Frédéric Keck around a retranslation of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl's 1926 article, ""Mentalité primitive et jeu de hasard,"" or ""Primitive mentality and games of chance,"" with the participation of Brittany Birberick, Roberte Hamayon, Keith Hart, Ghassan Hage, and Frédéric Laugrand. We have commissioned a new translation by Catherine Howard, who notes that this particular text offers an opportunity for reflecting on the surplus of translation, on the ways in which superficial similarities that belie semantic differences between French and English help sharpen and expand the discussion of the original work on the psychological, imaginary, and cultural stakes of different forms of gambling. For instance, Howard notes—and Hamayon elaborates on this in her own contribution—that Lévy-Bruhl's hasard, in French, does not have the dangerous connotations of hazard in English, but veers instead towards chance and unpredictability; the French chance in the original text, for another example, is best translated as luck (Howard, pers. comm., March 31, 2020). Luck was not a concept that Lévy-Bruhl was interested in exploring here. Instead, he focused on the certainty about outcomes brought to gambling in societies where these are informed by ritual practices and mystical beliefs. As Keck points out in his erudite introduction, which situates this essay within Lévy-Bruhl's oeuvre (and also in relation to French political and intellectual history of the period), by this point in his scholarly career Lévy-Bruhl was more interested in ""signs of the future which lead to mystical perceptions of invisible entities"" than in the cognitive dimensions that had preoccupied him in his earlier work.In these contexts, the failure to win indexes insufficient ritual preparations before gambling, or mistakes in dream interpretation, and not the absence of skill or luck in engaging in a game of chance. This aspect of Lévy-Bruhl's essay is highlighted in Hamayon's contribution to the colloquium, which pushes further the disaggregation of luck from games of chance to stress that luck is more ""the art of knowing how to seize the opportunity … to take advantage of gaps of uncertainty,"" and hence the result of a kind of skill in shaping future outcomes. This skill is possessed by the professional gambler, the financier, and other figures on which Lévy-Bruhl does not dwell much: his interest lies with ""pure gamblers,"" so consumed by the passion of the game itself ""that they would rather gamble in the face of almost certain loss than not gamble at all.""Keith Hart uses his own experience as a gambler to underscore the point that one only bets ""on things [one] knows very well"" if one is to make one's living at it, and addresses the problematic way in which Lévy-Bruhl constructs his argument centering around ideal types. Lévy-Bruhl's gamblers are animated by either reason or passion, whereas Hart points out that the opposition ""collapses in the face of empirical reality,"" in which both play a part. Hart reminds us of an essay by Meyer Fortes on ""Divination: Religious Premisses, and Logical Techniques,"" included in his book on religion, morality, and the person among Tallensi (1987), in which the diviner's role in managing the relationship between the occult and the patent for his clients is key to the kind of ""gambling"" performed in divination. Hart also analyzes money as another ""great unknown in our lives,"" and as such worthy of reflection in relation to gambling. As Lévy-Bruhl himself pointed out in his expansive reflections on games of chance, plenty of bets are made in the process of making money. Keck suggests in his introduction that in some ways Lévy-Bruhl's characterization of practices in the world of finance as a kind of gambling were harbingers of the collapse of the financial markets in 1929. In his own reflections on this matter, Hart draws a productive distinction between money-makers and money-takers, and focuses on the former as animated by beliefs as strong as those holding a religious faith, where calculation hedges future uncertainty.A future orientation infuses the perspective of Birberick and her interlocutors on the South African game of fafi, where each set of bets by an individual gambler must be seen in the sequencing of ""pulls"" that make them experience the game as a dynamic progression, even in the face of present losses, and informs an ethical commitment to making appropriate, not-too-low wagers, in order to be perceived as knowledgeable players of the game. Ghassan Hage begins with the ""gamble"" taken by his Lebanese interlocutors in deciding to emigrate in hopes of a better future, to frame his reflections on the prevalence of gambling among them in the diaspora. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's notion of illusio—""a mode of investing oneself in a social path""—and of the related lusiones, the ""odds and chances of success,"" which are what is at stake in gambling, Hage suggests that Lebanese migrants engage instead in a form of meta-illusio, for what they invest themselves in is the possibility of a particular path to a better future. In the pursuit of this path, they seek propitious prayers, blessings, and religious charms collectively subsumed under barakat, which ends up making ""diasporic success … more of a saint than … a lucky person or a great practical planner."" Haunting Lévy-Bruhl's essay, and several of the contributions to the colloquium around it—particularly Hamayon's contribution and the discussion of Fortes in Hart's piece—is the relationship between divination and gambling, a subject taken head-on by Frédéric Laugrand. Based on his work among indigenous people of the Canadian Arctic and the Philippines, the author finds that there, similar to elsewhere, ""science and economy cohabit quite well with mediums … and diviners,"" and that gambling and divining, in particular, are different but contiguous practices.Neurophysiological research has shown ""anticipation as a normal mental process for understanding events among humans … and nonhumans, such as animals and plants,"" and Laugrand points out that science increasingly is taking over areas of prediction that were once the domain of diviners, for instance in epidemiology and meteorology. There are many different ways of analyzing premonitions about the future in the Canadian Arctic, from bodily sensations like ringing ears or twitching eyes, to formal consultations with diviners, and distinctions are drawn between good and bad premonitions. In a similar manner, Ihaloy people in the Philippines, who live in a world plagued by natural disasters, regularly check for signs anticipating good or bad luck, and understand the former to be a gift from pleased ancestors, and the latter as signs of wrath from the gods. But in both settings, gambling is seen as a social activity, not the individual pursuit of wealth that Lévy-Bruhl understood it to be. Winners of Canadian bingo games share their take with others, and Ilahoy subject winning gamblers to rituals or expectations aimed at limiting their wealth. In the end, Laugrand agrees with Mauss's assessment of Lévy-Bruhl as being ""more a philosopher than an ethnologist,"" and he, as such, preferred in this essay to analyze ""similarities between ethnographic facts … [than] differences … from a single society.""Leading this issue's research articles is Brittany Birberick's ""Seeing Numbers,"" a deeper analysis of the articulation of games of chance—gambling—sociality, economic possibilities, and dream interpretation in inner-city Johannesburg, South Africa. The game of fafi, or omchina, brings together people of Jeppestown on a daily basis in a neighborhood park, to wait for Chinese ""runners"" who bring around the bags with winning numbers. Introduced by Chinese immigrants who first came to South Africa to work in mines during the nineteenth century, fafi resembles other games of chance elsewhere in the world, where particular dream images are linked to numbers, which are then used for gambling. Among these is the smorfia, practiced in the city of Naples, in Italy, where standard dream images linked to numbers are used to play the daily lottery (see De Sanctis Ricciardone 1987: 122). Like many similar practices (the word, smorfia, derives etymologically from Morpheus, ancient Greek god of dreams), this kind of numerology is historically linked to dream interpretation, and involved manuals written to guide it since ancient times, with important Jewish Kabbalist and Muslim texts among them. But it also produces spaces of sociability and communication, as bettors help each other analyze dreams, and share strategies.Cheryl Mei-ting Schmitz focuses on translation in the midst of a labor dispute at a Chinese firm in Angola. Questions of what can and cannot be said, of politeness and witchcraft loom large. If politeness allows the preservation of relationships amongst indirectly spoken unpleasantries, how can politeness be maintained when the unpleasant reality to be faced is the severing of a relationship? How does discussion of witchcraft become a mode of indirect speech? Where discussion of witchcraft is a mode of indirectness, how can it be politely translated in a context where the very mention of witchcraft accentuates the incommensurability of cosmologies of the different parties? Schmitz wrestles with such questions as she considers the limits of both accurate translation and the social role of the translator in a power-laden confrontation.Mirco Göpfert brings us to the police bureaucracy of Nigeria, to understand the issue of ""epistemophilic obsessions."" In the gendarmerie, information is power, or, at least, so it seems. Detectives need to know how their society works to solve crimes. They must understand the secrets of criminals, of the people who interact with them, and thus of almost everyone. But their need to know the secrets of others leads them to keep secrets themselves. They must protect their key informants to keep knowledge flowing, and at times they bluff about knowing secrets that they don't. But the police obsession with secrecy does not stop with crimes in the neighborhood. The police also need to understand their own bureaucracy, especially their superiors, on whom their career advancement depends. Why do the leaders close their doors and keep their file cabinets locked? What secrets are they hiding? Research in such an environment leads Göpfert to analyze the epistemophilic obsessions of our own profession. Indeed, not only is there a wealth of anthropological studies of societies and enclaves within them where institutional secrecy is prevalent, but there is also the tendency to claim special access to more prosaic forms of secrecy as an index of linguistic and cultural competence in the field (e.g., Piot 1993: 354). What secrets do ethnographers covet? Who is hiding information from us and who must be trusted? What secrets must we keep and when should we bluff about having secrets? And how does demonstrating access to secret knowledge play into our claims to ethnographic authority and expertise?Issues of translation and incongruence return to the fore in Arpita Roy's article about discordant discourses of nature at a pilgrimage center of temples and hot springs in the Indian town of Bakreswar. There, discourses coexist, intersect, and cause friction about scientific properties of the waters, the religious miracles of their cosmogenesis, and their magi","Two signal events have had a global impact during the time it has taken to produce this issue: the global COVID-19 pandemic that began spiking between late 2019 in China and early 2020 in Italy, and the spread of protests against state violence on black and brown bodies in the United States and elsewhere.

over the past few decades, with an emphasis on promoting mental health and well-being apart from the treatment and care of people with mental disorders. Recognition of mental health conditions as a public health problem, the development of community-based interventions, and the acceptance of a public health approach toward mental health care have contributed to this transformation. The public health model for mental health care includes a complete spectrum of mental health interventions ranging from prevention, promotion, early diagnosis, intervention for acute care, and maintaining treatment and support as part of chronic care and rehabilitation. Mental health care in older adults requires a public health approach with a focus on promoting the mental health and well-being through a comprehensive and multi-sectoral intervention.[1] Mental health problems in older adults have several biological and psychosocial determinants, including important factors, such as social isolation and loneliness.[2] This clinical practice guideline will focus on interventions to promote mental health and well-being of older adults. The basic concepts related to mental health and well-being [Table 1] are addressed in the initial article of this supplement. Some of the issues relevant to mental health and well-being in older adults, such as interventions to promote mental well-being in those with medical comorbidity, are addressed as a separate article in this supplement. These issues will be addressed briefly in this article. The scope of this clinical practice guideline will predominantly include the interventions that are likely to be implemented through the health system in general with a specific focus on the role of mental healthcare services. These interventions will be relevant for health professionals from general health care and multidisciplinary fields related to mental health. Promoting mental health and well-being in older adults requires a multi-sectoral approach through the involvement of services from the departments of health, social care, finance, revenue, transport, housing, police, skill development, labor, urban development, rural development, nongovernmental organizations, etc., The role of the psychiatrist in these aspects will include the promotion of advocacy, contribution to the organization of these services, and promoting access to these interventions.Table 1: Recent understanding of mental health and well-beingMENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN OLDER ADULTS The biological and psychosocial factors influencing mental health and well-being of older adults aged 60 years and above include specific factors relevant to this age group in addition to the general factors influencing mental health across the lifespan [Table 2].Table 2: Factors important for mental health and well-being in older adultsPOPULATION AGING AND MENTAL HEALTH The increase in life expectancy and decline in the fertility rate have contributed to the increase in the proportion of older adults aged 60 years and above globally. The decline in the proportion of the younger population, along with the increase in the population of older adults, contributes to population aging [Table 3]. This demographic change is occurring at a faster rate in low- and middle-income countries, such as India. Many European and North American countries have taken more than 50 to 100 years for the increase in the proportion of older adults from 10% to 20%.[3] In India, this change is projected to happen rapidly over 20 to 30 years. Hence, the economic development in India during this period of demographic transition is likely to be inadequate to provide adequate health and social care support required to ensure the mental health and well-being of older adults, which is equivalent to the standards in some of the developed countries.Table 3: Challenges due to population agingLIFE COURSE PERSPECTIVE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN OLDER ADULTS The determinants of mental health and well-being in older adults are not restricted only to old age.[4] It extends over the complete lifespan. This understanding is essential to focus on promoting interventions across the lifespan. Even if the interventions are initiated at a later age, it will be helpful to address some of the risk factors and contribute to the promotion of mental health and well-being [Table 4]. However, it is preferable to start these interventions as early as possible.Table 4: Factors promoting mental health and well-being of older adults over the lifespanPROMOTING WELL-BEING ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF INTRINSIC CAPACITY AND FUNCTIONING Intrinsic capacity refers to the composite of the physical and mental capacity of an individual.[5] Aging is associated with a decline in intrinsic capacity. Old age is often considered synonymous with poor health due to significant limitations in physical and mental capacity, contributing to dependency on the working adult population. However, there are significant heterogeneity and diversity in the profile of intrinsic capacity across the spectrum of older adults.[6] One-third of older adults have preserved intrinsic capacity with adequate functioning. One-third of older adults in the middle of the spectrum may have a decline in capacity, but they may have preserved functioning with appropriate care and treatment for the physical and mental health issues. The older adults in the lower third of the spectrum have a significant loss of capacity due to a decline in physical or mental health. They may have health conditions, such as dementia and stroke associated with significant disability. Promoting well-being and healthy aging is applicable to all older adults in the complete spectrum of intrinsic capacity and functioning. The nature of the interventions and the requirement for environmental support will vary according to the level of intrinsic capacity and functioning [Table 5].Table 5: Approach to interventions for promoting well-being based on the level of intrinsic capacityTARGET GROUP FOR INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN OLDER ADULTS The predominant target group for the intervention will be older adults, as their participation and involvement are very important for the success of any intervention to promote mental health and well-being in older adults. However, the mental health and well-being of older adults are influenced by several factors that extend beyond the older adults themselves [Table 6].Table 6: Examples of interventions with different stakeholders to promote mental health and well-being in older adultsSome of the important stakeholders determining the mental health and well-being of older adults include family members, caregivers, neighborhood, and environment. Family support and the role of an age-friendly environment are very important in promoting well-being and healthy aging.[7] Older adults with severe sensory impairment and mental disability may not be able to have active engagement in the interventions to promote well-being. In this context, interventions with other stakeholders can be very helpful. TASK-SHARING APPROACH The older adult population is growing rapidly across the globe and in India due to the increase in life expectancy, reduction in mortality, and improvement in the health system. The population of older adults aged 60 years and above in India is more than 13 crores. A significant proportion of the population seeking health care across all levels of the health system and those living in institutional care are older adults. A specialized workforce for the care of older adults is very limited even in developed countries. It will be very difficult to implement interventions for promoting mental health and well-being in older adults only through the professional workforce. A task-sharing approach by training other stakeholders, including lay people involved in the care of older adults, is an important strategy to address the shortage of specialized workforce.[1] Collaborative care interventions using the task-sharing approach have been implemented in primary care for the management and prevention of depression, suicide risk, etc.[8] The task-sharing approach is essential for scaling up the interventions for promoting mental health and well-being in older adults. TECHNOLOGY-ASSISTED INTERVENTIONS The use of technology is emerging as an important strategy for effective implementation and scaling up of services to promote mental health and well-being.[9] It is useful to minimize the human resource requirement and improve access for interventions to those having difficulty due to limitations in mobility, lack of access to safe transport, etc., Restrictions for personal contact during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic contributed to the growth of acceptance of technology-assisted interventions. Many interventions to promote mental health and well-being in older adults have been implemented with the assistance of technology. The older adult population has several challenges with the use of technology-assisted interventions. Limitations in literacy, familiarity with the use of technology, sensory impairment, etc., are barriers for utilizing technology-assisted interventions. Older adults can improve in digital literacy with the provision of training and support.[10] Tele-mental health services have gained importance with the launching of ""National Tele-Mental Health Programme (TELE-MANAS)"" in India. It is essential to use this effectively for the older adult population. INDIVIDUAL VS GROUP INTERVENTIONS Interventions to promote mental health and well-being in older adults have been delivered individually or as a group intervention to patients, caregivers, or other stakeholders.[11] Both of these approaches have specific advantages or disadvantages. Individual interventions will be helpful for facilitating a personalized care plan. It will be useful in outpatient settings with significant heterogeneity in the profile of patients. However, individual interventions are more resource intensive and challenging to ensure access to a large number of patients. Group interventions are more feasible in institutional settings, such as daycare or residential care. It is also likely to be more cost-effective. Group interventions provide the opportunity for learning from the experience of the peer group. The design of the group intervention itself provides an opportunity to address the issue of social isolation. PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN OLDER ADULTS Mental health issues in older adults are an important public health problem requiring a systematic intervention using a public health approach.[12] Promoting awareness about mental health and well-being of older adults among all stakeholders is essential. Ageism, mentalism, and ableism are important biases contributing to the neglect of this issue.[13] Many older adults, family caregivers, and health professionals consider mental health issues in older adults as normal for aging and do not seek help. Public health systems at the level of Health and Wellness Centers and primary health centers have an important role in promoting mental health and well-being as they have closer access to the community. Public health programs, such as National Program for Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE), National Mental Health Program (NMHP), National Program for the Control of Non-Communicable Diseases, and National Palliative Care Program, have an important role in the promotion of mental health and well-being in older adults.[14] SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS Social isolation is the lack of an adequate number of contacts with other individuals either in person or through other means. Loneliness is a perceived emotional state regarding the adequacy of interpersonal contact. Some of the individuals having social isolation may not perceive loneliness. Individuals having multiple social relationships within the family and outside may still have perceived loneliness if they are not satisfied with the level of relationship.[15] Older adults have increased vulnerability to both social isolation and loneliness. More than 50% of older adults are reported to have social isolation. One-third of older adults are reported to have significant loneliness. Social isolation and loneliness are important factors influencing the mental health and well-being of older adults.[16] Loneliness is a complex phenomenon that extends beyond the mere sensation of solitude. It encompasses a personal perception of social detachment or an absence of significant interpersonal relationships. The state of experiencing prolonged loneliness can result in a range of adverse outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, heightened susceptibility to chronic ailments, general decline in the standard of living, and increased risk of mortality. Furthermore, the management of loneliness is closely intertwined with the mental health and well-being of elderly individuals.[16] The psychological, emotional, and physical well-being of older adults can be significantly influenced by loneliness. To adequately tackle and mitigate loneliness among the elderly population, it is imperative to comprehend its consequences for their psychological state and holistic welfare. Hence, it is imperative to prioritize strategies to foster psychological well-being and promote a state of being comfortable, healthy, and happy, while simultaneously tackling the problem of social isolation. The following are various strategies that can be employed to manage loneliness in older adults, with the ultimate goal of enhancing their overall well-being and mental health [Table 7].Table 7: Strategies to manage issues around lonelinessSocial support: The establishment of a robust social support system is crucial in addressing feelings of loneliness. Seniors can engage in various activities to sustain their social networks, including upholding preexisting relationships with loved ones, cultivating fresh connections through social events, and taking part in community initiatives tailored to their interest. A dependable and empathetic support network can offer psychological solace, camaraderie, and a feeling of inclusion. Develop social bonds: Facilitating significant social and interpersonal associations can serve as a strategy to mitigate the effects of social isolation. Facilitating social interaction and bonding among elderly individuals is crucial and can be achieved through various means, such as joining clubs or interest groups, volunteering, or participating in shared hobbies. Significant associations offer a feeling of direction, comprehension, and the chance to exchange experiences with individuals who share similar interests. Strengthen Networking: The integration of technology in communication can serve as a beneficial mechanism in mitigating feelings of loneliness. Instructing senior citizens on the operation of smartphones, computers, and social media applications has the potential to facilitate their ability to maintain social connections with loved ones, despite geographical separation. The utilization of video conferencing, messaging applications, and social media platforms can facilitate consistent communication, mitigate sentiments of seclusion, and foster engagement in online communities. Accessible, affordable mental health resources, and facilities: The provision of mental health support is of paramount importance in addressing the mental health requirements of the elderly population. The experience of loneliness has the potential to play a role in the onset or escalation of various mental health disorders, including but not limited to depression and anxiety. Facilitating access to mental health resources, such as counseling or therapy, can furnish assistance, direction, and techniques for coping with loneliness and its related emotional difficulties. Ensure involvement and participation in meaningful and fulfilling activities: Encouraging participation in meaningful and fulfilling activities has been shown to mitigate feelings of loneliness. It is advisable to motivate senior citizens to engage in hobbies, pursuits, and undertakings that elicit pleasure and a feeling of achievement. This may encompass artistic pursuits, physical activities, scholarly endeavors, or participation in community undertakings. Participating in stimulating activities has the potential to cultivate a sense of direction, enhance emotional well-being, and facilitate social engagement. Develop an inclusive and supportive (age-friendly) environment: Establishing an inclusive and supportive environment is a crucial factor in promoting the mental health and overall well-being of elderly individuals within their home and community setting. This may entail the implementation of measures to guarantee the availability of community areas that are easily reachable, advocating for initiatives that cater to the needs of older adults, and furnishing various modes of transportation. Moreover, promoting intergenerational linkages by stimulating engagements with younger cohorts via mentorship initiatives or intergenerational events can counteract sentiments of seclusion and solitude. Supporting caregivers: The provision of support to carers is essential in promoting the mental health and overall well-being of older adults. Ensuring that carers are equipped with sufficient resources, education, and support is crucial in enabling them to effectively tackle the issue of loneliness among older adults. The aforementioned services encompass respite care, support groups, and communication skill training, which are aimed at effectively addressing emotional needs. The provision of an inclusive environment and system can aid in the effective management of loneliness among the elderly population. To effectively manage and address loneliness among the elderly, it is necessary to adopt a comprehensive approach that takes into account various aspects, such as social, emotional, and environmental factors. The mental well-being and overall quality of life of elderly individuals can be improved through the implementation of strategies that prioritize mental health support, promote meaningful engagement, and foster social connections. RETIREMENT AND VOLUNTEERING INITIATIVES Countries, such as India, have a fixed age for retirement in most of the formal employment positions. Many older adults are healthy after the usual retirement age of 60 years, and they have a further life expectancy of around 20 years. Older adults with adequate financial protection during retirement may not require gainful employment after retirement. Individuals engaged in agricultural work, business, and other self-employment may not have a specific retirement age, but they may discontinue regular work due to physical and mental health issues or frailty. Ensuring meaningful engagement for older adults in the postretirement period has an important role in promoting mental health and well-being. Volunteering initiatives across many areas have expanded significantly through many nongovernmental organizations. Older adults participating in volunteering initiatives for healthy aging will enable peer support interventions. Participation in any volunteering activity of their interest will be helpful to reduce social isolation and loneliness and promote well-being. Some government and non-governmental organizations have initiated regular and periodic educational sessions for retirement planning, including aspects of mental health and well-being. HEARING AND VISION IMPAIRMENT Older adults have a high prevalence of hearing and vision impairment. Awareness about treatable cause of vision impairment, such as cataract, has improved significantly, and services to treat vision impairment have expanded significantly over the last few decades. In contrast to this, most of the hearing impairment in older adults remain undiagnosed and untreated. High level of stigma, difficulty in affording good-quality hearing aids, and low level of awareness are some of the factors contributing to this. Hearing and vision impairment have a significant influence on social isolation, loneliness, and poor quality of life with an adverse impact on the mental health and well-being of older adults. STRESS MANAGEMENT Older adults are vulnerable to being exposed to multiple stressors that are common in old age. Maintaining mental health and well-being requires older adults to have adequate coping skills to manage these stressors. Common stressors faced by older adults include bereavement, diagnosis of health conditions, retirement, financial stressors due to catastrophic health expenditures, and disability. Many older adults are resilient and manage these stressors effectively without developing decompensation in their mental health. However, a significant proportion of older adults develop mental health issues related to these stressors. Promoting effective stress management through supportive psychosocial interventions and lifestyle interventions, such as exercise and yoga therapy, is helpful. INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS Older adults have a high prevalence of chronic physical health conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. They also have a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, substance abuse, etc., The presence of multiple physical and mental health conditions, including frailty, is common in older adults. The provision of integrated health care close to the community at the level of primary health care is required to improve access to health care, reduce the treatment gap, and promote healthy aging. ROLE OF NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS AND REDUCTION IN IATROGENIC EFFECTS Older adults with physical and mental health conditions are often exposed to polypharmacy, contributing to a significant risk for drug interactions and iatrogenic adverse effects. Older adults are sensitive to medications and have a high risk for drug-induced adverse effects even with therapeutic doses of medications due to pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes. There is a requirement for the effective use of non-pharmacological interventions, such as psychotherapy, psychosocial interventions, and lifestyle interventions for those with milder mental health issues and those who are not responding to pharmacotherapy alone. Regular monitoring of adverse effects is essential to limit any adverse consequences of medications on mental health and well-being of older adults. AYURVEDA, YOGA, UNANI, SIDDHA, AND HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH) INTERVENTIONS Many older adults seek treatment from traditional systems of medicine, such as AYUSH. The government of India has advocated the integrated delivery of AYUSH and allopathic health services as part of these integrated health services. Yoga therapy has an important role in promoting mental health and well-being as it has shown effectiveness in the treatment of depression, anxiety, insomnia, etc. HEALTH AND WELLNESS CENTRES The government of India has introduced the Ayushman Bharat Initiative with the development of ""Health and Wellness Centres"" as an important component. These centers in the primary health system envisage the provision of integrated health care with significant emphasis on the component of preventive and promotive interventions to improve the mental health and well-being. Older adults will be one of the important beneficiaries of this initiative as services for non-communicable diseases and lifestyle interventions to promote mental health and well-being will be available in these centers. The availability of group intervention sessions to promote awareness, physical activity, and yoga therapy will be helpful to reduce social isolation and loneliness in rural areas. SOCIAL CARE SERVICES Older adults with chronic conditions, such as stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and frailty, may have significant physical and mental disability requiring assistance for daily activities. A complete range of social care services, including home-based care, day care, residential long-term care, and palliative care services, are required to promote mental health and well-being of older adults with significant disability. Many of these services are not available and accessible easily to older adults. The development of these services to cater to the needs of older adults from low-income groups is essential to promote inclusive and equitable services for promoting mental health and well-being. Training in geriatric mental health and dementia care is essential for caregivers involved in providing social care services. Guidance for accessing welfare benefits through disability certification is also likely to enhance the well-being of older adults with disability. ADVOCACY Health professionals and other individuals with an interest to promote the mental health and well-being of older adults have the responsibility to promote advocacy on this issue. Advocacy on this issue with the government and nongovernmental organizations will be helpful to promote adequate human resources and services in this field. Promoting awareness about legal support available through ""The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007"" and guidance to access ""Elderline"" services (National Helpline for Elderly 14567) can promote the safety and well-being of older adults. SPIRITUALITY AND RESILIENCE Many older adults engage in spiritual activities to cope with significant physical and mental health challenges and promote resilience. Despite the decline in physical and mental capacity with aging, older adults are shown to have more resilience and they are able to face adversities using wisdom and resilience. Recent studies have demonstrated that cognitive and behavioral interventions can promote wisdom and resilience in older adults, enhancing the scope for positive and healthy aging. CONCLUSION Promoting mental health and well-being in older adults is gaining public health importance due to the population aging and the rapid increase in the prevalence of mental health problems in this population. Social isolation and loneliness are important factors contributing to the adverse impact on the mental health and well-being in older adults. A public health approach to address this issue requires multi-sectoral intervention. Health professionals, including those working in the field of mental health, have the responsibility to promote awareness, identify mental health conditions early, and implement comprehensive interventions toward healthy aging. The entire spectrum of intervention, including prevention, promotion, acute care, chronic care, rehabilitation, and palliative care, is required. Personalizing the intervention to promote person-centered care will be preferable to promote the mental health and well-being of older adults. Several evidence-based interventions are available, but there is a requirement for scaling up the implementation and developing more evidence through implementation research.

generated by cultural sociology and examine how its disavowal of politics, preoccupation with behavior, commitment to appearing nonjudgmental, and understatement of structural causes manifest in social service organizations targeting different populations. 
I begin by reviewing the past decade of cultural sociological research on poverty. I show that cultural sociologists draw boundaries between their ‘empirical’ questions and the ‘political’ demands of their critics and argue that they thereby obfuscate both research that challenges their agenda and their own ideological commitment to liberalism. This commitment is most evident in the behavioral focus of their research, which leads them to untenable conclusions that are also incompatible with their professed desire to avoid victim-blaming narratives. 
I then examine an increasingly popular approach to raising public awareness about poverty and training people the state expects to work on the poor: The Poverty Simulation. The Poverty Simulation is an immersive experience in which middle-class individuals role-play limited aspects of the lives of poor and low-income family members as they navigate everyday life. I show that simulation facilitators trust in negative, arousing feelings to convince participants of the difficulty of living in poverty and to motivate them to adopt an empathetic interactional style. Yet, even as facilitators guide participants toward experiences of negative emotional states, they also deflect them from experiences of conflict and the political. 
Finally, I compare how experts in two organizations that target different populations/problems—women in (economic) transition and chronically/intergenerationally poor people—give financial advice to their clients. I argue that personal finance experts’ claims that we are culturally silent about money provide them with an “advisor’s benefit,” i.e., the appearance of being able to free others from silence and ignorance and guide them toward financial wellness. I then show that experts’ enactment of the advisor’s benefit is conditioned by organizations’ temporal frames. I conclude that while it can be less depoliticizing than focusing on the future, emphasizing the habituality of (financial) thoughts and behaviors deemphasizes the importance of money and material resources, not to mention politics, in explanations of poverty and social change.",,,false,,false,,

SectionsAbout ToolsAdd to favorites ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Children who are learning English as a second language and live in homes where languages other than English are spoken are known as English-language learners (ELLs). As these children enter kindergarten, they often lag behind their language-majority peers in the skills necessary to start reading, with the gap remaining throughout their school years. A 2007 report from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) on reading indicates that 70% of fourth-grade ELLs and 71% of eighth-grade ELLs scored below basic reading ability. Although the statistics are discouraging, research indicates that these children can achieve grade-level literacy skills if they receive effective literacy instruction (Waits, Campbell, Gau, Jacobs, Rex, & Hess, 2006). Preschool programs can have a direct impact on the academic skills of ELLs, potentially closing the gap with quality education. Therefore, it is imperative that preschool personnel be trained to support the emergent literacy skills that prepare preschoolers to enter kindergarten ready to learn to read (Garcia & Gonzalez, 2006). Emergent literacy skills are believed to develop during preschool years for most children, when they are ""in the process of becoming literate"" (e.g., Teale & Sulzby, 1986, p. xix; Justice, 2006; Yaden, Rowe & MacGillivray, 2000). The National Early Literacy Panel (2004) identified alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, writing/writing name, oral language skills, and concepts about print in preschool children as predictors of later reading and writing success in elementary school children. Justice (2006) organized these skills into four domains: Print knowledge—alphabet knowledge and concepts about print Phonological awareness—sound awareness Writing—name writing, invented spelling Oral language—grammar, vocabulary, narrative These same skills predict the reading performance of ELLs; however, they are not sufficient predictors because native-language performance also predicts English literacy skills (e.g., Dickinson, McCabe, Clark-Chiarelli, & Wolf, 2004). We propose a model to address emergent literacy in this population that involves native and second-language instruction through these four domains. To achieve success, ELLs must be in environments in which: The first language and literacy are not only valued, but enriched in a planned and systematic manner Instruction in English as a second language (ESL) is targeted to the child's English-language developmental level while also being challenging Teachers are knowledgeable about the normal processes of ESL development and literacy development in bilinguals The program has a strong home-school connection that provides parent training and views parents as resources Print Knowledge Print knowledge refers to a child's growing understanding of the relationship between the form and purpose of print (e.g., Adams, 1990; Justice & Ezell, 2004). Elements of print awareness include understanding print conventions, recognizing words and letters as distinct units of meaning, and having alphabet knowledge (Justice & Ezell, 2002; Lomax & McGee, 1987). Print knowledge has been associated with reading ability in English as a second language in ELLs (Klingner, Artiles, & Barletta, 2006). Depending on the orthography of the native language, this knowledge can transfer to English as a second language and may be used to support emerging literacy. Exposure to different print in different languages and orthographies helps the child connect writing to his or her native language and culture and also raises the awareness of the symbolic and arbitrary nature of written language. Phonological Awareness Phonological awareness is the understanding that oral language can be broken up into individual words, words into syllables, and syllables into individual sounds, or phonemes (Bradley & Bryant, 1983; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998). Skills included in phonological awareness include rhyme, syllable-awareness, and phonemic awareness. Although there is variability among children, phonological awareness skills develop gradually during preschool. Some children learn by exposure to sound patterns through book activities, word play, or nursery rhymes; other children may require more explicit instruction. Children who do well on sound-awareness tasks are better readers than their peers who struggle with those tasks (Adams, 1990; Wagner & Torgeson, 1987). Children who are ELLs and who live in poverty or with limited literacy experiences often do not develop phonemic awareness in preschools. With adequate preschool instruction and exposure to literate environments, however, ELLs can readily learn phonemic awareness skills (Barnett et al., 2007). ELLs with strong phonological awareness skills in English demonstrated a higher potential for reading achievement in later years (e.g., Genesee, et al., 2005; Klingner, et al., 2004). Further, these skills readily transfer from the native language to second language and from the second language to the native language (e.g., Dickinson et al., 2004; Cardenas-Hagan et al., 2007). The orthography of the native language also will influence the transfer to the second language. Syllabic languages, for example, will transfer at the syllable level, but not at the phonemic level (Bialystok, Luk, & Kwan, 2005). Writing Emergent writing is considered a child's first experience with writing. This early writing appears during the preschool years and follows a sequence that progresses from drawings to scribbles, invented spelling, and eventually conventional writing; this progression continues during the school-age years and beyond (Teale & Sulzby, 1986). Children's early experiences in experimenting with different forms of writing support later reading and writing success (Adams, 1990; Richgels, 1995). Bialystock (1997) found that bilingual preschoolers are as proficient in emergent writing skills in their two languages as their monolingual peers. Oral Language Oral language provides the building blocks for literacy. According to a report by the National Reading Panel (2000, p. 15), ""Oral vocabulary is a key to learning to make the transition from oral to written forms, whereas reading vocabulary is crucial to the comprehension processes of a skilled reader."" Children who do not develop these core language skills lack some of the most fundamental skills essential for reading (Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 1999; National Early Literacy Panel, 2004). Preschool ELLs present with several challenges in emergent literacy development. They must develop these skills in a language they do not speak while still acquiring emergent literacy skills and oral language skills in their native language. Further, if they come from an impoverished environment, they will likely be playing catch-up in native and second-language vocabulary development. Therefore, one of the most critical emergent literacy skills for ELLs to develop is oral language in the native and second languages. Strong native language skills predict oral language, reading, and writing skills in the second language (e.g., August, Carlo, Dressler, & Snow, 2005; Carlo et al., 2004). Strategies for Improvement Improving emergent literacy in preschool ELLs requires the use of planned instruction or activities that address the prerequisite skills in the two languages, develop strong oral language skills, and connect home with school. The following strategies can develop these skills. Print Knowledge and Phonemic Awareness Several evidence-based techniques promote emergent literacy skills in preschoolers. Print-referencing during shared book reading is an effective means for teaching print awareness (e.g., Bus, van Ijzendoorn, & Pellegrini, 1995; Justice & Ezell, 2002). Phonological awareness is most effectively taught by progressing through a hierarchy of early learned skills in a systemic fashion in the native and the second languages (e.g., Adams, 1990; Cisero & Royer, 1995; Carrillo, 1994), beginning with a child's awareness of common environmental sounds, then progressing to the later skills of phonemic awareness. The native language is always a resource for phonemic awareness. For example, for Spanish-speaking ELLs the language is transparent; that is, there is a high correspondence between sound and symbols in Spanish and English. This similarity can provide a fairly consistent match for children in the early stages of letter knowledge and initial sound identification (Bialystok et al., 2005). Building letter and sound knowledge in Spanish, for example, would allow the child to learn these skills more quickly while learning English as a second language. Inclusion of bilingual print awareness and writing activities in preschool also will allow ELLs to develop skills in both languages and to increase awareness of different writing systems. These concepts promote understanding that writing serves a purpose and is a means of expressing ideas. To address English emergent literacy skills in this population, Gersten and Geva (2003) stressed the importance of modifying instruction when teaching specific graphemes or phonemes. If a letter or sound does not exist in the child's native language, explicit instruction and repetition may be required. Frequent comprehension monitoring will be needed to ensure that children are following instructions and learning target skills. For example Spanish-speakers may need to learn to discriminate English vowels, because there are only five vowels in Spanish. ELLs also need to build language proficiency in order to connect phonemic awareness, writing, and letter knowledge to language that they understand. Oral Language Skills To improve oral-language skills and facilitate emergent literacy skill development, ELLs need to build vocabulary, oral language comprehension, and production. The role of vocabulary has been documented as a predictor of later reading development within and across languages (August et al., 2005; Carlo et al., 2004; Proctor et al., 2006). Often there is no bilingual or native-language instruction in preschool programs. This context presents a problem for ELLs because they often do not continue to develop their native language unless those skills are stimulated in their home environment and used for instruction in school (Barnett, Yarosz, Thomas, Jung, & Blanco, 2007). ELLs entering preschool require language-rich environments that focus on overall language development. For example an ELL who comes from a family with few adult-child interactions will have limited experience with oral language in the native language (c.f., Hart & Risely, 1994). If the school focuses on English acquisition of colors and shapes, the child is missing critical development of literate language like stories and vocabulary in the native language and may not have strong foundations for second language acquisition. To build vocabulary skills, explicit and implicit instruction is necessary (Schwanenflugel et al., 2004). Explicit instruction using Tier 2 vocabulary (or vocabulary that is not prototypical) (Beck et al., 1987) is required. ELLs benefit from Tier 2 explicit vocabulary instruction in the native language. At the same time, this vocabulary can be provided in English if it is presented through concrete, hands-on experiences and in thematic unit that allow for repetition throughout the day. Implicit vocabulary instruction is done primarily through thematic units that build the selected or target vocabulary, as well as vocabulary associated with the target vocabulary and theme through incidental teaching (Schwanenflugel et al., 2004). Through a bilingual approach to vocabulary instruction, ELLs continue growth in the native language, while they develop concepts in English as a second language. Other techniques shown to improve vocabulary include dialogic and repeated reading (see Johnson & Yeates, 2006, for a review of research). Dialogic reading uses open-ended questioning, ""wh-"" questioning, and active listening during shared book reading to encourage the child to tell the story. The reader can point to ""new words"" and discuss them. The use of books has several advantages: books build background knowledge, supplement and enhance a thematic unit, combine native culture and access to U.S. culture, and expose children to different genres (stories, expository texts, poems, etc.). We believe that exposure to a variety of texts is optimal. We combine Latino culture books, such as Carlos and the Squash Plant, with classic American stories that are available in the two languages, such as Little Red Riding Hood and the Three Little Pigs. Bilingual expository or information books tend to be of high interest to boys; again, these books build not only vocabulary but also text structure knowledge and background that prepare children for academic success. Dialogic reading can also be used to help ELLs build abstract language, especially in the native language, and to acquire the second language. Skills such as inferencing, prediction, and identifying main ideas build comprehension skills. ELLs can learn these skills before they become fluent in English and then transfer them to English. In a recent project, for example, we found that kindergarten ELLs trained bilingually to summarize a story performed better in English than those trained to summarize only in English (Smyk, Restrepo, Gray, & Morgan, 2008). This finding demonstrates that while they acquire English, ELLs can continue to develop valuable skills in the native language, which will subsequently transfer to and facilitate English acquisition. ELL children can learn to interact with texts with higher language levels. They will learn to predict what can happen next; they learn to answer ""why"" questions or to connect what they read with their lives through these techniques, if used in preschool, rather than waiting until they can speak English. English as a Second Language August and Hakuta (1997) identified several useful strategies for facilitating English acquisition. They suggested using clear, explicit skill instruction, while modifying the language level according to the children's level of proficiency in English. For example an ELL child who has been unsuccessful in communicating with peers and teachers may lapse into a silent or nonverbal period. In these cases there is a need for input that is repetitive and concrete in order to acquire a second language; a child who is at a more fluent stage still needs repetition and routines but also needs multiple opportunities to use the target skill and higher-level questioning. ELLs need to practice new skills with children and adults who have higher-level language proficiency. Pairing children with more proficient students, scaffolding their conversations, and expanding on what they say with correct structure or wording are appropriate techniques to build sentence length and complexity. Home-School Connection Parents are an excellent resource for preschool programs. They can share native language books, rhyming songs, stories, skills, and cultural artifacts. In addition parents play a role in developing their child's native language, which is particularly important when there are no bilingual personnel in a child's preschool program. It is important to provide parents with training to help them understand the role of native language in overall academic, language, and biliteracy development, for cultural identity, and in English acquisition. Training can help parents understand aspects of the school culture in the United States, such as expectations related to homework and achievement, school involvement, and grade-level performance. Many parents may be satisfied with their child's development but may not know that their child is behind in emergent literacy skills in the native or second language. For example parents may think that at the end of preschool their child is doing well because the child can communicate basic needs in English, but they may not know that the kindergarten teacher expects the child to know some letters, colors, and shapes. Explaining these expectations helps parents understand the system better and helps ensure that the child is better prepared. Families with limited resources may need training on how to stimulate language, but the training should be provided so they can do it in a culturally appropriate manner. Retelling a story from a book, for example, may not be a culturally appropriate task for some families, although parents should be aware that this skill is important. Additionally, asking parents to label objects may feel unnatural to them. Finding alternative ways to build vocabulary through conversations and discussions may be more appropriate. In some cultures, it is disrespectful to involve oneself in the classroom or to offer support to the teacher out of the belief that the best way to help is to allow the school to be fully responsible for educating children. For other families, their best effort is to get the child to school. Beyond that, they may not have time to go over homework, or they may not have the language or literacy skills to read an unfamiliar book in English. Professionals working with ELL families should consider the economic, environmental, cultural, educational, and language barriers of each child and family that preclude a parent from being involved. Conversely, often parents are not asked to be involved because of these barriers when they would gladly participate in the school because they want to learn and be with their child. Building language and emergent literacy in ELLs requires a planned and systematic approach to address the native and second languages and to provide parents with needed resources and support. Systematic and planned bilingual language and literacy instruction promotes growth in the two languages and does not impede or slow English-language acquisition. The speech-language pathologist in the preschool can have a preventive role in addressing these skills bilingually or through parent and teacher training. Working with preschool teachers on using ESL techniques and native language skills will have a strong impact on preparing children for kindergarten. Working with parents will have a significant impact when they know the expectations, when the tasks given are culturally appropriate, and when their needs are considered.

animal flesh that has been manufactured outside of an animal’s body using a suite of technologies and processes that fall under the broad banner of biofabrication. This flesh, termed “clean meat” by proponents, is expected to be safer, healthier, victimless and far more environmentally benign than flesh derived from an animal’s body within intensive animal agriculture systems. As the Good Food Institute, an established non-governmental body for reducing meat consumption through the creation of new products, claims:Clean meat is one breakthrough solution to the problems associated with raising animals for food. Clean meat is created by growing meat outside of an animal from a small cell sample, eliminating the need for factory farming and slaughter.This kind of narrative has dominated media and scholarship on the new material, which this article refers to as biofabricated animal material (see, e.g., Dilworth and McGregor; Driessen and Korthals; O’Riordan et al.). Recently, however, a counter-narrative about the material has entered key discursive spaces. Triggered by lobbying efforts of meat industry stakeholders and taking place largely in the legal terrain, the counter-narrative is not critical of the technologies and processes deployed to bring the material about. Rather, and at this stage, it largely casts doubt on the nature of the material itself and what actions bring meat into existence. This line of discussion is concerned with the ontology of meat and of biofabricated animal material, that is, it is concerned with what an object is in reality to different groups, how it comes to be that object, and the ways in which these varying understandings of the reality intersect, diverge and influence outcomes (Mol, Body Multiple; Law and Lien).Before public attention was drawn to this new material and the suite of related, emerging technologies being developed to create it, what meat was and how it came about has been relatively stable. We generally understood meat to be specific kinds of animal flesh, prepared in particular ways in accordance with cultural norms, and which were extracted from a dead animal in a farming context. Even with the rise of plant-based norms within meat cultures, meat was still understood as being animal flesh. Indeed, the animal welfare and animal rights movements have in part reinforced the ontology of meat with their emphasis on the interests of the animal in the context of meat production and consumption, while the cognitive dissonance that “guilty meat-eaters” experience when consuming meat stems in part from their understanding of meat as animal flesh derived from an animal killed in order to provide flesh. Yet, the accepted reality—i.e. the ontology—of meat has recently become destabilised. Meat is now the subject of multiple interpretations, or ontologies, of how meat is meat, which realities compete in debates about legal definitions of meat.Broadly, proponents of biofabricated animal material understand meat to be anything that is animal flesh regardless of the processes that made it come about, including whether the flesh was ever part of a body. This ontology is being deployed in a political way to support the collective, discursively constructed expectations that biofabricated animal material will disrupt meat culture, while assuring consumers that the material is, in reality, still meat. Meanwhile opponents focus on the enactment of meat, that is, the agricultural practices that go into making “animal flesh” and turning it into meat. These contesting ontologies are playing out in largely legal arenas to date, suggesting that what is legally defined as meat will have political and cultural consequences for the future of food.Yet, this article calls into question how different the parallel ontologies of meat are in terms of the realities they enact. It argues that while biofabricated animal material is expected to transform the production and consumption of meat, the material’s ontologies reinforce existing interrelationships between the dominant meat culture and the law. Additionally, the expectations surrounding biofabricated animal material vests the material with transformative power, even though it does not challenge the structural factors, namely law and culture, which underlie the exploitation and commodification of animals. I begin by delineating the co-constituting relationship between law, the realities of meat production and consumption, and meat culture. I then unpack the interface between different ontologies of meat and consider why the contest has taken place in legal terrains. From here, I consider the key expectations that have assigned transformative power to biofabricated animal material. I suggest that these expectations work to reinforce existing meat culture, and the configurations of power that benefit from it, as supported via legal instruments.Meat, Meat Culture and the Law Central to cultural legal studies is the theory of “law as culture” rather than law and culture being separate spaces that occasionally intersect (Mezey; Sarat and Simon; Ewick and Silbey; cf. Schlag). This understanding sees law and culture as non-static dimensions co-constructing each other, and law as a particular cultural product through its ability to make and stabilise meaning (Weisbrod; Mezey). Scholars in this space have unpacked some of the ways in which the meanings, practices and sources associated with the law influence ways of being, sensing and knowing on a day-to-day level by “shaping consciousness and making asymmetries of power seem, if not invisible, then natural and benign” (Sarat and Simon 19; see also Marusek).Drawing on this body of work, law and meat culture can be understood as mutually building and reinforcing each other; simultaneously, relevant laws are an artefact of meat culture. Potts (19–20) uses the term “meat culture” to refer to expressions of carnism (Joy chap. 2), including “the representations and discourses, practices and behaviours, diets and tastes that generate shared beliefs about, perspectives on, and experiences of meat.” Carnism is the ideology that condones and legitimises the killing and eating of particular animals. Expressions of carnism construct meat as a food that is “natural, normal, necessary and nice” (Piazza et al.). Laws that condone and enable intensive animal agriculture are an expression of meat culture, as are legal definitions that demarcate the material dimensions of meat. Simultaneously, the role of law in representing and locking-in meat culture is an outcome of socio-cultural processes that diffuse meat culture based on carnism.This co-constructing relationship between law and meat culture is especially evident in the statutory provisions that recognise animals as capable of being the object to which private property rights determine relations (for instance, s. 12 of the Animal Care and Protection Act 2001 (Qld)). Humans, as opposed to animals, are positioned as having a higher moral status that automatically attracts rights to life and to a certain standard of treatment by others and governments (Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Hence, animals are objects of human and corporate ownership rather than holders of rights due to their intrinsic worthiness as living beings. This understanding of animals as commodities both embodies and reinforces contemporary meat culture, and especially Western notions of human-animal relations based on subordination and domination (Huggan and Tiffin 10).The absence of formal law further enables meat-eating cultures stemming from a carnist ideology. In Australia, animal welfare laws recognise that farm animals experience pain and suffering via generic animal cruelty offences that would consider as “cruel” many routine husbandry practices and animal slaughtering. However, most animal welfare laws provide a defence to, or exemption for, actions of a producer that would otherwise constitute an animal cruelty offence if the same actions were directed towards companion animals. In order to provide an effective defence or exception, the producer must have acted in compliance with codes of practice set by farm industry groups (see, e.g., Animal Welfare Act (SA) s. 43). Unsurprisingly, given the vested interest of the industry, the standards set for farm animal welfare are broadly inconsistent with the standards for animal welfare expected by Australian publics (see, e.g., Doughty et al.; Coleman). Goodfellow suggests that the failure of Australian welfare standards to meet public expectations and basic animal welfare principles represents a kind of meat-based “cultural capture”. The perceptions and values of industry have become absorbed by those regulatory agencies created to regulate for animal welfare consistent with community expectations (Goodfellow 197).Finally, law works to obscure intensive animal agricultural methods and mass processing and retail of animal flesh products. For instance, law and legal institutions prevent documentation of intensive animal agriculture facilities (ABC v Lenah Game Meats), and through its absence enables the misrepresentation of on-farm conditions on food labels (Parker et al.).Law’s role in embodying and perpetuating meat culture is further explored in popular culture and legal cultural studies. For instance, the Netflix film Okja confronts the links between capitalism, especially market-based approaches to regulating societies, and intensive animal agriculture, while highlighting the related disconnects between humans, animals and nature. Gunawan, through a jurisprudential reading of the Netflix film Okja, explained how the film “highlights law’s desire for a legal landscape grounded in fictional constructs – the fiction that some animals have a higher moral status than others” (264). Because Okja does not fit neatly into the existing categories of human or non-human animal, the film unpacks how laws categorise living bodies in ways that can be considered arbitrary and inconsistent while being compliant with dominant meat culture.Contemporary meat culture and its constitutive relationship with law is associated with European colonial systems of the 18th and early 19th centuries. Colonial processes expanded specialised farms in settler colonial states and led to large amounts of meat being exported to European countries (Friedmann and McMichael). The violence associated with these changes, for humans, animals and the environment, were legitimated by law that both legitimised European domination and was used as a tool for asserting domination over human and non-human animal populations (McBride).Colonial expressions of meat culture connected the high consumption of animal flesh in Western diets with white supremacy, strength and masculinity; meanwhile, the diets of Indigenous populations, which tended to be more plant-based, were portrayed as lesser and a cause of their perceived inferiority as non-whites (see, e.g., Leroy and Praet). Gambert and Linné through their media analysis of #Soyboy tweets observed how colonial representations of meat-based diets as superior to plant-based diets continued to be highly influential on Western culture and politics. They explained that the use of #Soyboy in alt-right media must be understood as “a contemporary extension of colonial era tropes of plant-food masculinity like the ‘effeminized rice eater’ of the late 19th-century … and as an example of the way the alt-right uses irony and humor to advance its often dead-serious views.”Globalising, capitalist processes in the mid- to late 20th century followed the trajectory set down during colonisation as capital, markets, governments and authorities continued the expansion of large-scale, intensive production of meat, combined with increasing consumption of animal flesh typified by high productivity and low animal welfare (Goodfellow; D’silva). These changes are integrated with, and were enabled by, broader globalising capitalist processes that further incentivised intensive animal agriculture, and technological transfer programs to “modernise” animal agriculture in developing countries (see, e.g., Gonzalez). These processes and other societal and cultural changes facilitated the “nutrition transition,” that is, the global shift away from Indigenous and traditional diets and towards Western diets typified by a high consumption of animal products (Popkin).Law plays a central role in legitimising and enabling the industrial ways of making animals into meat. It provides the “methodology by which it is possible to continue forms of domination” (Wadiwel 287). Intellectual property law played a profound role in enabling the agricultural research and development for intensive animal agriculture, especially through the expansion of intellectual property rights over animal genetics (Kloppenburg; Aoki). Indeed, private investment in agriculture continues to increase including for intensive animal agriculture technologies (Pardey et al.), while the space for developing alternate ways of agriculture narrows (Johnson). Law also provides standards of meat production and composition suited to industrial facilities, which fosters citizen-consumer trust and legitimacy in the system despite the increased risk and scale of food safety issues associated with intensive animal agriculture (see, e.g., Webber et al.).Legal Definitions of Meat and Ontological PoliticsCollectively deployed, discursive expectations regarding biofabricated animal material have successfully destabilised a broadly accepted singular ontology of meat, that is, the pre-existing reality of meat as flesh extracted from an animal enacted in a farming context (Jönsson et al.). While different groups assign particular symbolic qualities to meat, the objective understanding of reality was that meat was muscle tissue that had formed part of an animal’s body and was culturally considered edible. Parallel to debates on the nature of “milk,” the destabilisation of meat has played out largely on legal terrains. Specifically, meat industry groups informally or formally have called for legal definitions of meat that understand the material to be directly derived from the carcass of an animal (McCarthy and Brann).A key moment in in the breaking of the singular ontology of meat was the US Cattlemen’s Association’s filing of a petition to the US Department of Agriculture. This petition requested, among other things, that the definition of meat be the “tissue or flesh of animals that have been harvested in the traditional manner” and should be used to “inform consumers that the product is derived naturally from animals” (2). The reality produced in this petition, and then conveyed through the media, is that meat is the entire body of a dead animal or parts cut off from a body of a dead animal. Moreover, the petition positioned intensive animal agriculture as traditional and natural while the biofabrication of animal material was unconventional and artificial. For the meat industry, meat is enacted through practices from breeding, raising, and slaughtering animals which instills the end product of meat with not only its existence as meat but also its other qualities like naturalness and healthfulness (Mol, Body Multiple). According to this perspective, muscle tissue is not meat unless it is enacted in particular ways.Although the influence of law on cultural and social structures is neither linear nor complete, law still has a unique ontological-political power to categorise things in ways that widely influence and coordinate behavior (Ruiter; Mol, “Ontological”; Viljanen; Deakin). In other words, law configures and reconfigures a real practice, relationship or event into fictitious legal categories (Ewick and Silbey 16). The contestation over meat and the focus on legal definitions certainly reflects a general awareness of the ontological-political power of law, which was a theme further explored in Okja, discussed above.The law in the US, as well as in Australia, have definitions of meat that would, mostly and depending on the processes used, exclude biofabricated animal material (see, e.g., Johnson). Legal definitions of meat tend to align with the reality of meat that opponents of biofabricated animal material hold and which definitions are consistent with dominant cultural understandings of meat. Thus, political and ontological debate about meat taking place in legal terrains is not due to any lack of clarity in legal categories that require the law to represent a societal decision between two or more ontologies. Rather, the debate is an attempt to influence the social and cultural ontologies of meat that interact and underpin the legal definitions of meat in order to influence consumer acceptability and markets. In this way, the debate over what meat is and how meat comes about is reminiscent of other battles over “mouths, minds and markets” (Lang and Heasman). As the next section illustrates, however, what meat is and how it is enacted by consumers and retailers as meat does not change at the retail and consumer end of the food chain.Just Meat But Still Transformative? Figure 1: Fictional representation of possible future “meat” products (Hayden McNamara 2018)The conjectures about what biofabricated animal material will do for the environment, for human health, and for animals are merely the collective “imaginings, expectations and visions” of stakeholders with an interest, commercial and political, in the material (Borup et al. 385). An emerging body of literature has undertaken discourse analyses on the collectively deployed, discursively constructed expectations for biofabricated animal material across spaces including scholarly works, mass media and public comments. Broadly, this body of work finds that the collective expectations deployed by proponents in relation to biofabricated animal material have been uncritically taken up in mass media, scholarship (Dilworth and McGregor), and among its developers (Chiles). Studies on public perceptions of biofabricated animal material suggest that the general public also expect benefits to eventuate for animals, humans and the environment, perhaps to a lesser extent, while the publics examined simultaneously conceive of biofabricated animal material as “unnatural” and animal flesh from an animal as “natural” (Laestadius and Caldwell; Wilks and Phillips).Although the dominant expectations overlap, I categorise them as follows:Biofabricated animal material will be available on a commercial scale.The material is meat. Consumer uptake will be such that market signals will result in a decline in intensive animal agriculture.A decline in animal agriculture will reduce, if not remove entirely, the significant suffering and harms associated with its performance. This decline will be causally associated with healthier, safer and happier environments for humans and animals.Unpacking the expectations in this way shows the technological determinist ideologies at play and from which these discursive constructs stem. Accordingly, practical pathways for such a transition or the multiple assumptions and variables underpinning the expected benefits are absent.Collective and discursively constructed expectations are an essential component to technological innovation for attracting investment, gaining regulatory acceptance and inspiring and attracting developers. Such expectations are also shaping the agenda and the actors involved (van Lente and Rip). For instance, the expectations that biofabricated animal material will be “victimless” has mobilized animal interest groups and non-governmental actors who, in various ways, advocate for biofabricated animal material. The expectations for a victimless animal flesh product have been so compelling, consistent with Western ideas of technology and progress (Jasanoff), that various truths about the current processes have not prevented these coalitions forming. These include that biofabricated animal material is yet to be produced on a commercial scale due to technological barriers (Bhat et al.), and that the processes commonly entail slaughtering animals. The extraction of cells from the “donor” animal, for instance, commonly relies on the use of invasive and lethal procedures to extract the tissue containing the cells (see, e.g., Genovese et al. 4; Burton et al.). Moreover, tissue samples must be taken repeatedly because their proliferation abilities are not well conserved in the cell culture (Boonen and Post).Meanwhile, foetal bovine serum is the main ingredient in mediums used to grow biofabricated animal material because it is an especially good source of growth factors. This serum is essentially refined blood from the foetus of a pregnant cow. To maintain blood quality, the method for drawing out the blood is particularly invasive. The foetus is “alive” within the removed uterus while its heart is punctured with a needle and its blood is drained (van der Valk et al.). Thus, expectations are being collectively deployed in ways that obscure the violence that is still implicated in the consumption of animal flesh, analogous to how animal welfare claims on food labels misrepresent the processes and decisions behind the product.Importantly, the expectations about biofabricated animal material also represent and reinforce a particular understanding of what the problem is with animal agriculture and food systems more generally (Bacchi). Broadly, biofabricated animal material is expected to solve the ills associated with the mass-production and consumption of animal flesh leaving unproblematic the underlying cultural, political, legal and social structures that enabled these harms in the first place. Reflecting this problem-solution construct, Bill Gates wrote on his blog:The demand for meat will have doubled between 2000 and 2050. This is happening in large part because economies are growing and people can afford more meat. That’s all good news. But raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact. Put simply, there’s no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people. Yet we can’t ask everyone to become vegetarians. (As much as I like vegetables, I know I wouldn’t want to give up hamburgers – one of my favorite foods). That’s why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources.It is common for such neo-Malthusian reasoning to be deployed in support of capital-intensive, industrial agricultural technologies, and that laws that enable and protect them. Yet, the projections about how much meat production “needs” to increase are being conveyed as normative claims about what food systems should do, rather than what the projections are intended to provide: predictions about the future based on current trends so we can intervene now. That is, statistics about how much food and meat production must increase by are based on a continuation of current trends such as high rates of meat consumption and food waste rather than a systemic transformation. As the FAO stated in relation to its own projections regarding growing populations and increasing meat demand, the projections are positive statements of “the most likely future … not necessarily the most desirable one” (Bruinsma 1). By treating these projections as targets, expectations for biofabricated animal material normalise the increasing consumption of meat and leave out the possibility of other trajectories, such as, the further mainstreaming of plant-based diets.Along with being non-disruptive of dominant meat culture (Goldstein), the expectations conveyed implicitly condone market-based approaches to the ethical, environmental and social issues intertwined with production and consumption patterns. They position consumer-citizens as capable of “voting with their fork” to bring about a better food system by purchasing biofabricated animal material. Meanwhile, the fact that biofabricated animal material is being developed within existing configurations of power and wealth is absent from the expectations surrounding the ability of biofabricated animal material to disrupt agriculture. For instance, Tyson and Cargill, two of the world’s largest meat processing companies, have invested into companies developing the material.Critical engagement with the dominant meat culture that condones and legitimises the exploitation of animals, and with the law that reflects and enables it, is absent from the collective expectations about biofabricated animal material. Other methods for addressing the multiple harms associated with industrial agriculture, for instance a meat tax, incentives for plant-based businesses, educational campaigns to promote plant-based diets, are not within the problem-solution equation underlying expectations about biofabricated animal material. Rather, the expectations for the material as meat continues problematic aspects of meat culture that place “the highest symbolic value on flesh foods and the lowest value on plant foods” (Lee 80). The expectations surrounding biofabricated animal material imply that the issues with intensive animal agriculture, from cruelty to pollution to antibiotic resistance, can be resolved without changing, or minimally changing, the ontology of meat or the underlying meat culture, and without altering the exploitative, capitalist basis common to legal regimes for animals and intensive animal agriculture.ReferencesAoki, Keith. “Food Forethought: Intergenerational Equity and Global Food Supply - Past, Present, and Future.” Wisconsin Law Review 2 (2011): 399–479.Bacchi, Carol Lee.

This flesh, termed “clean meat” by proponents, is expected to be safer, healthier, victimless and far more environmentally benign than flesh derived from an animal’s body within intensive animal agriculture systems. As the Good Food Institute, an established non-governmental body for reducing meat consumption through the creation of new products, claims:Clean meat is one breakthrough solution to the problems associated with raising animals for food. Clean meat is created by growing meat outside of an animal from a small cell sample, eliminating the need for factory farming and slaughter.This kind of narrative has dominated media and scholarship on the new material, which this article refers to as biofabricated animal material (see, e.g., Dilworth and McGregor; Driessen and Korthals; O’Riordan et al.). Recently, however, a counter-narrative about the material has entered key discursive spaces. Triggered by lobbying efforts of meat industry stakeholders and taking place largely in the legal terrain, the counter-narrative is not critical of the technologies and processes deployed to bring the material about. Rather, and at this stage, it largely casts doubt on the nature of the material itself and what actions bring meat into existence. This line of discussion is concerned with the ontology of meat and of biofabricated animal material, that is, it is concerned with what an object is in reality to different groups, how it comes to be that object, and the ways in which these varying understandings of the reality intersect, diverge and influence outcomes (Mol, Body Multiple; Law and Lien).Before public attention was drawn to this new material and the suite of related, emerging technologies being developed to create it, what meat was and how it came about has been relatively stable. We generally understood meat to be specific kinds of animal flesh, prepared in particular ways in accordance with cultural norms, and which were extracted from a dead animal in a farming context. Even with the rise of plant-based norms within meat cultures, meat was still understood as being animal flesh. Indeed, the animal welfare and animal rights movements have in part reinforced the ontology of meat with their emphasis on the interests of the animal in the context of meat production and consumption, while the cognitive dissonance that “guilty meat-eaters” experience when consuming meat stems in part from their understanding of meat as animal flesh derived from an animal killed in order to provide flesh. Yet, the accepted reality—i.e. the ontology—of meat has recently become destabilised. Meat is now the subject of multiple interpretations, or ontologies, of how meat is meat, which realities compete in debates about legal definitions of meat.Broadly, proponents of biofabricated animal material understand meat to be anything that is animal flesh regardless of the processes that made it come about, including whether the flesh was ever part of a body. This ontology is being deployed in a political way to support the collective, discursively constructed expectations that biofabricated animal material will disrupt meat culture, while assuring consumers that the material is, in reality, still meat. Meanwhile opponents focus on the enactment of meat, that is, the agricultural practices that go into making “animal flesh” and turning it into meat. These contesting ontologies are playing out in largely legal arenas to date, suggesting that what is legally defined as meat will have political and cultural consequences for the future of food.Yet, this article calls into question how different the parallel ontologies of meat are in terms of the realities they enact. It argues that while biofabricated animal material is expected to transform the production and consumption of meat, the material’s ontologies reinforce existing interrelationships between the dominant meat culture and the law. Additionally, the expectations surrounding biofabricated animal material vests the material with transformative power, even though it does not challenge the structural factors, namely law and culture, which underlie the exploitation and commodification of animals. I begin by delineating the co-constituting relationship between law, the realities of meat production and consumption, and meat culture. I then unpack the interface between different ontologies of meat and consider why the contest has taken place in legal terrains. From here, I consider the key expectations that have assigned transformative power to biofabricated animal material. I suggest that these expectations work to reinforce existing meat culture, and the configurations of power that benefit from it, as supported via legal instruments.Meat, Meat Culture and the Law Central to cultural legal studies is the theory of “law as culture” rather than law and culture being separate spaces that occasionally intersect (Mezey; Sarat and Simon; Ewick and Silbey; cf. Schlag). This understanding sees law and culture as non-static dimensions co-constructing each other, and law as a particular cultural product through its ability to make and stabilise meaning (Weisbrod; Mezey). Scholars in this space have unpacked some of the ways in which the meanings, practices and sources associated with the law influence ways of being, sensing and knowing on a day-to-day level by “shaping consciousness and making asymmetries of power seem, if not invisible, then natural and benign” (Sarat and Simon 19; see also Marusek).Drawing on this body of work, law and meat culture can be understood as mutually building and reinforcing each other; simultaneously, relevant laws are an artefact of meat culture. Potts (19–20) uses the term “meat culture” to refer to expressions of carnism (Joy chap. 2), including “the representations and discourses, practices and behaviours, diets and tastes that generate shared beliefs about, perspectives on, and experiences of meat.” Carnism is the ideology that condones and legitimises the killing and eating of particular animals. Expressions of carnism construct meat as a food that is “natural, normal, necessary and nice” (Piazza et al.). Laws that condone and enable intensive animal agriculture are an expression of meat culture, as are legal definitions that demarcate the material dimensions of meat. Simultaneously, the role of law in representing and locking-in meat culture is an outcome of socio-cultural processes that diffuse meat culture based on carnism.This co-constructing relationship between law and meat culture is especially evident in the statutory provisions that recognise animals as capable of being the object to which private property rights determine relations (for instance, s. 12 of the Animal Care and Protection Act 2001 (Qld)). Humans, as opposed to animals, are positioned as having a higher moral status that automatically attracts rights to life and to a certain standard of treatment by others and governments (Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Hence, animals are objects of human and corporate ownership rather than holders of rights due to their intrinsic worthiness as living beings. This understanding of animals as commodities both embodies and reinforces contemporary meat culture, and especially Western notions of human-animal relations based on subordination and domination (Huggan and Tiffin 10).The absence of formal law further enables meat-eating cultures stemming from a carnist ideology. In Australia, animal welfare laws recognise that farm animals experience pain and suffering via generic animal cruelty offences that would consider as “cruel” many routine husbandry practices and animal slaughtering. However, most animal welfare laws provide a defence to, or exemption for, actions of a producer that would otherwise constitute an animal cruelty offence if the same actions were directed towards companion animals. In order to provide an effective defence or exception, the producer must have acted in compliance with codes of practice set by farm industry groups (see, e.g., Animal Welfare Act (SA) s. 43). Unsurprisingly, given the vested interest of the industry, the standards set for farm animal welfare are broadly inconsistent with the standards for animal welfare expected by Australian publics (see, e.g., Doughty et al.; Coleman). Goodfellow suggests that the failure of Australian welfare standards to meet public expectations and basic animal welfare principles represents a kind of meat-based “cultural capture”. The perceptions and values of industry have become absorbed by those regulatory agencies created to regulate for animal welfare consistent with community expectations (Goodfellow 197).Finally, law works to obscure intensive animal agricultural methods and mass processing and retail of animal flesh products. For instance, law and legal institutions prevent documentation of intensive animal agriculture facilities (ABC v Lenah Game Meats), and through its absence enables the misrepresentation of on-farm conditions on food labels (Parker et al.).Law’s role in embodying and perpetuating meat culture is further explored in popular culture and legal cultural studies. For instance, the Netflix film Okja confronts the links between capitalism, especially market-based approaches to regulating societies, and intensive animal agriculture, while highlighting the related disconnects between humans, animals and nature. Gunawan, through a jurisprudential reading of the Netflix film Okja, explained how the film “highlights law’s desire for a legal landscape grounded in fictional constructs – the fiction that some animals have a higher moral status than others” (264).

The dissertation consists of five original articles that were published between 2011 and 2013 in national and international public health journals with peer review. Based on the well-known close relationship between social origin and educational prospects, the impli-cations for the healthy development of adolescents were analysed. This issue is not only rele-vant for public health and health policy, but also for research on education and inequality as well as political debate on fair opportunities. The focus is on the admission to secondary edu-cation which has been identified by educational researchers as a crucial step for subsequent educational career and resultant employment and income opportunities. The dissertation is based on the assumption that the transition from primary to secondary education might also be important for the health prospects of adolescents. In order to prove this hypothesis, health status and health behaviour of adolescents with different educational trajectories were exam-ined considering their social origin. Statistical analyses were based on data of the first German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS). The KiGGS baseline study was conducted by the Robert Koch Institute from May 2003 to May 2006 in order to collect comprehensive data about the health situation of children and adoles-cents living in Germany. The results show that adolescents’ own educational status is highly relevant for their healthy development – independent of their social origin. This applies par-ticularly for key aspects of health behaviour. Furthermore, the thesis illustrates the health im-pact of intergenerational social mobility: upward mobility seems to be accompanied with im-provements in health and better health behaviours whereas downward mobility seems to be occasionally associated with detrimental health effects.

predetermines challenges that limit the choice of consumption patterns, savings and other economic activity for Gen Y(millennial), the maturation process occurred during the Great moderation period, which lasted from mid-1980 until at least 2007. Great moderation was characterized by a low level of inflation, stable economic growth, the end of the ""era"" of uncertainty, an increase in the willingness to take risks, an increase in the prices of financial assets, and a decrease in the volatility of business cycle fluctuations in developed countries compared to previous decades. The period of Great Moderation ended with the onset of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. The ""New Norm"" of the world economy or ""Global Chaos"" since 2008 has been characterized by eight trends: deterioration of US-China relations; aggravation of political fragmentation within the EU; further accumulation of debts and injection of artificial liquidity not into the financial, but into the real sector; inflation; increasing tax pressure on the rich as one of the tools to combat economic inequality; actualization of environmental topics, in particular, the climate issue with the prospect of introducing a carbon tax; technological revolution and technological confrontation, which will be determined by the coexistence of different technological standards; intensifying intergenerational competition with Gen Y predominating by 2030, which will set the global agenda and ultimately the demand for policy and how it is implemented. It is noted that in the conditions of the formation of the information and digital economy, Gen Y revised their approaches to employment, which is accompanied by the transformation of Gen Y human capital into network human capital. Y-reality is characterized by: the transition from efficiency to sustainability in strategic planning, which will affect the slowdown in productivity growth; increased demand from market agents for government participation; development of public-private partnership; increased deglobalization, which will accelerate the decline in productivity; rising unemployment; decrease in consumption; decrease in savings; an increase in debt; declining coordination of international economic policy. The impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy (coronanomics) not only provokes a temporary drop in production, but also changes the basis for the functioning of the world economy, laying the foundations for sustainable economic imbalances. A specific feature of Y-reality is recognized as a change in approaches to monetary policy (quantitative easing and hedge money), as well as a human-centric quantitative easing known as ""basic guaranteed income"". Y-reality will be characterized by the search for new indicators of well-being and economic growth, in particular, which will lead to the realization of a new purpose of economic systems and the formation of a ""new norm"" of rational economic behavior, taking into account the impact of human activities on the environment. The slowdown in economic growth under Y-reality conditions becomes sustainable, it is objectively determined by the presence of numerous imbalances, and therefore it should be treated as a given. ""Global disorder"" came to mean not only the existing state of affairs and contradictory trends, but also the desired state, transforming the meaningful content of the concept of ""crisis"", giving it the connotation of a stage of the cycle, which can give impetus to development. The acronyms SPOD, VUCA and BANI were considered, which characterized the transformational processes in the modern economic system and the formation of Y-reality.","The purpose of the article is to determine the features of the development of the world economy during the formation of the predominant role of Gen Y in the structure of the population, Y-reality is defined as a common historical context for generations that affects their economic behavior and predetermines challenges that limit the choice of consumption patterns, savings and other economic activity for Gen Y(millennial), the maturation process occurred during the Great moderation period, which lasted from mid-1980 until at least 2007. Great moderation was characterized by a low level of inflation, stable economic growth, the end of the ""era"" of uncertainty, an increase in the willingness to take risks, an increase in the prices of financial assets, and a decrease in the volatility of business cycle fluctuations in developed countries compared to previous decades. The period of Great Moderation ended with the onset of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. The ""New Norm"" of the world economy or ""Global Chaos"" since 2008 has been characterized by eight trends: deterioration of US-China relations; aggravation of political fragmentation within the EU; further accumulation of debts and injection of artificial liquidity not into the financial, but into the real sector; inflation; increasing tax pressure on the rich as one of the tools to combat economic inequality; actualization of environmental topics, in particular, the climate issue with the prospect of introducing a carbon tax; technological revolution and technological confrontation, which will be determined by the coexistence of different technological standards; intensifying intergenerational competition with Gen Y predominating by 2030, which will set the global agenda and ultimately the demand for policy and how it is implemented. It is noted that in the conditions of the formation of the information and digital economy, Gen Y revised their approaches to employment, which is accompanied by the transformation of Gen Y human capital into network human capital. Y-reality is characterized by: the transition from efficiency to sustainability in strategic planning, which will affect the slowdown in productivity growth; increased demand from market agents for government participation; development of public-private partnership; increased deglobalization, which will accelerate the decline in productivity; rising unemployment; decrease in consumption; decrease in savings; an increase in debt; declining coordination of international economic policy. The impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy (coronanomics) not only provokes a temporary drop in production, but also changes the basis for the functioning of the world economy, laying the foundations for sustainable economic imbalances. A specific feature of Y-reality is recognized as a change in approaches to monetary policy (quantitative easing and hedge money), as well as a human-centric quantitative easing known as ""basic guaranteed income"". Y-reality will be characterized by the search for new indicators of well-being and economic growth, in particular, which will lead to the realization of a new purpose of economic systems and the formation of a ""new norm"" of rational economic behavior, taking into account the impact of human activities on the environment. The slowdown in economic growth under Y-reality conditions becomes sustainable, it is objectively determined by the presence of numerous imbalances, and therefore it should be treated as a given. ""Global disorder"" came to mean not only the existing state of affairs and contradictory trends, but also the desired state, transforming the meaningful content of the concept of ""crisis"", giving it the connotation of a stage of the cycle, which can give impetus to development. The acronyms SPOD, VUCA and BANI were considered, which characterized the transformational processes in the modern economic system and the formation of Y-reality.",N. Reznikova; Оlena V.

'…': [606]}",en,False,closed,"It is now commonplace to observe that the transitions from youth to adulthood (Furlong and Cartmel 1997; Stokes and Wyn 2007) have become more fragmented, and even to question the value of these categories for understanding the life course. In the Fordist era of the mid-twentieth century, working people could base their life plans - including in personal relationships - on the expectation of relatively secure employment contracts with large stable employers. Under such social arrangements, education and work corresponded with distinct and sequential periods of life, and any further training came on-the-job mostly at employers' expense (Watson et al. 2003). But in contemporary post-industrial societies fewer workers are now employed by large companies/ organisations, and in the course of their working lives, children will almost certainly have more jobs than their parents. The short shelf life of skills and occupations means that, as politicians and employers keep telling us, training/education is a lifelong challenge. Among the variety of risks and calculations associated with late modernity (Giddens 1991) is what we might call credential anxiety - deciding whether to invest time and - in an increasing user-pays environment - money in various forms of post-school education/training.The organisations/institutions that might have provided the foundations for political opposition to precariousness have been eroded. The decline in trade union membership, for example, is well documented; in Australia only 15% of workers are paid-up members (Kelly 2015). But also important is the ideological shift towards neoliberalism, which has undermined the collective institutions of social democracy and made individuals responsible for managing their lives and careers. While, as some commentators have observed (Leadbeater 2000), the new economy has liberated workers from the Fordist script of the job-for-life, the price of this is high. Precariousness and individualisation have accentuated existing social inequalities. In the new economy, social capital assumes greater significance as more 'fast' jobs are allocated by word of mouth, rather than through a formal advertisement and selection process. So those with family contacts, who went to the right school and speak and dress in the right way are able to go further.Those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds lack the networks and the cultural capital required to make it through. With family money, middle-class kids can tread water in precarious labour markets for longer. Their parents can help them with deposits for home loans and they will accommodate them for longer in the family home. The idea of inter-generational inequity recurs frequently in media reports on the distribution of wealth in the West. However, this idea conceals the larger situation; in situations of mass youth precariousness, intergenerational transfers are much more important than ever. The plight of the youthful 'precariat' (Standing, 2011) is compounded by the geography of the new economy. Despite the growing importance of digital communications, and the promise that relations of propinquity will become less and less important to economic activity, there has ironically been an increasing centralisation of employment opportunities (Sassen 1991) and of the networks through which many such opportunities are allocated. This activity is often located in places where gentrification has made housing so expensive that it is out of reach to all but the professional elite. So in addition to working long hours many young workers have to commute considerable distances from relatively affordable housing to their place of work.But the most corrosive effect of precariousness is psycho-social. It has undermined the very conditions not only on which we plan for the future but also on how we compose a coherent narrative of self. Those who are tossed around by the vagaries of skittish labour markets will struggle to unite the vocational fragments (Sennett 1998). …",,,false,,false,,

[634]}",en,False,closed,"Basic dimensions of sustainable development policies Despite fact that true ecological transition began more than nine thousand years ago, and that ecopolitics has been with us since beginnings of time--after all, if it was chaos (not to be confused with a biblical reference to existence of economists before creation ... we simply point out to extreme entropy of Big Bang), it is also a fact that Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden ostensibly due to an ecological act ...--only recently have we awakened to need to reckon with sustainability. It is true that concern with deterioration of natural systems is almost so old as human being presence in planet. Plato (1945), for example, already warned his contemporaries for serious consequences of deforestation and of overgrazing more than 2300 years ago. modern notion of sustainability, however, has its origin in international debate which begun in 1972 in Stockholm and consolidated twenty years later in Rio de Janeiro. Notwithstanding variety of interpretations found in literature and in political speech, great majority of conceptions represent variations on definition suggested by World Commission on Environment and Development, presided by then Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Brundtland (1987). Sustainable development is that which meets needs of present generation without compromising possibilities of future generations to satisfy their own needs. often repeated statement that human beings constitute center and raison d'etre of development calls for a new development style that is environmentally sustainable in access and use of natural resources and in preservation of biodiversity; that is socially sustainable in reduction of poverty and inequality and in promoting social justice; that is culturally sustainable in conservation of system of values, practices and symbols of identity that, in spite of their permanent evolution, determine national integration through time; and that it is politically sustainable by deepening democracy and guaranteeing access and participation of all sectors of society in public decision-making. This new development style must be guided by a new development ethics, one in which economic objectives of growth are subordinated to laws governing operation of natural systems, subordinated as well to criteria of human dignity and of improvement in quality of people's life. Let us briefly specify this definition in order to unveil basic components of new development paradigm, and to glimpse at their implications for formulation of public policies. Certainly, interpretation introduced here refers to a development paradigm and not of growth. This seems justified for two key reasons. First of all, to allow for a clear intergenerational and ecological limit to process of economic growth. Contradicting commonly accepted notion that sustainable development cannot be attained without growth--a conceptual trap that not even Brundtland Report itself was able to avoid (see for example, Goodland et al., 1992)--the paradigm of sustainability assumes that growth, defined mostly as monetary increments of product, and as we have been experiencing it, constitutes an intrinsic component of insustainability of current style. In words of Roefie Hueting, the less we need is an increment in national income (Hueting, 1990). This new paradigm emphasizes that development must produce qualitative changes in quality of life of human beings. More than mercantile goods and services exchanged in market, these aspects include social, cultural and aesthetic dimensions of meeting material and spiritual needs. It seems warranted to reproduce here wise observations of Herman Daly (1991) with respect to displacement of growth as ultimate goal of development by a process of qualitative changes: The recognition of impossible is foundation of science. …",,,false,,false,,

communities (Ellis et al., 2007; Wallerstein & Duran, 2006). It is anchored by several main pillars, including recognition of the community context, indigenous knowledge, and practices; shared leadership and decision-making; capacity building; and empowerment and transformation for social change (Blumenthal, 2011; Minkler & Wallerstein, 2003; Wallerstein et al., 2005). When applied in real-life scenarios, CBPR fosters mindful and reciprocal relationships by deflating power imbalances and dismantling distrust between mainstream academic researchers (outsiders) and refugee community constituents (insiders) (Tobias et al., 2013). Participatory Action Research (PAR), from which CBPR derives, has been described as a “decolonizing methodology” that counters social inequities through the emphasis on community members and researchers coproducing knowledge to promote social change (Kia-Keating & Juang, 2022). CBPR includes rigorous approaches to engage community members and reduce power differentials, including scrutiny of community members' and researchers' gains and potentials for harm from the research process, and the accountability of the latter to the former (Kia-Keating & Juang, 2022). Such approaches are key to transformative work with marginalized communities in a societal and institutional climate of structural racism. In particular, youth from refugee-origin communities within the United States differ markedly from the dominant society in their ethno-history, identity, cultural beliefs, and world views (Reynolds & Bacon, 2018). These differences can heighten youth from refugee-origin communities' vulnerability to adverse mental health outcomes (Frounfelker et al., 2020). However, this also has implications for their potential to act as agents of community empowerment when they are supported through the education process (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 2018). In the United States, there has been more emphasis on supporting refugee youth to adjust to the receiving society's educational expectations and settings (Reynolds & Bacon, 2018), and less on recognizing and developing their cultural and linguistic expertise to bridge mutual gaps with mainstream agencies, resources, and society to empower their communities. This is where the CBPR pillars—equitable voice, recognizing indigenous knowledge, and community capacity building focus—can be agents of transformation and change. For example, Yoon et al. (2022) used the CBPR approach to engage and examine acculturation, cultural integration, and life satisfaction with South Sudanese refugee youth/young adults formerly known as “the Lost Boys” of Sudan. CBPR facilitated refugee youth storytelling as a way of building their history in the United States, and for affirming their existence and purpose in this new country setting. For Southeast Asian refugee youth engaged in CBPR, the benefits have included expanded skills to conduct youth-centered research, improved oral communication, and increased confidence and empowerment as leaders for social change (Patraporn, 2019). Conflict transformation (CT) refers to a holistic approach to reconfiguring conflicts into opportunities for positive relationship building and social change (Lederach et al., 2007; Rupesinghe, 1995). It is characteristically defined by its application of nonviolent methods (e.g., dialog, negotiation, and mediation) in addressing and increasing understanding, equality, and respect within social relationships (Frazer & Ghettas, 2013). This makes CT particularly well suited for attending to the complex dimensions of social conflicts within tribal communities with a goal of developing practical and sustainable templates for targeted actions when future conflicts arise (Madden & McQuinn, 2014). CT as an approach aligns well with CBPR as both focus on relationship building through dialog, negotiated agendas and spaces, and collaboration among its actors. Furthermore, CT (as does CBPR) recognizes and tries to address power imbalances and inequalities by focusing on changing social structures and relationship patterns that exclude community member voices (Lederach, 2003). Taken together, CBPR and CT are an effective conceptual framework and practical approach to addressing the concerns, challenges, and agency of marginalized refugee communities and their youth. The Montagnards, an indigenous people from the Highlands of Central Vietnam, are not ethnically Vietnamese, but comprise different tribes with multiple cultures and languages. Their name belies the unity it implies since it was a French colonial term (“highlanders”) that referred to where tribes lived (Central Highlands) (Andresen, 1988). The term “Montagnard” describes several individual tribes who lived in proximity to one another at a greater or lesser distance, with varying degrees of interaction. They fought alongside U.S. special forces troops during the Vietnam War and suffered from violence and deprivation. Their villages experienced high levels of retributive persecution and ethnic violence after the war ended. In 1986, the first small group (200) of Montagnard refugees arrived in the Piedmont Triad (cities of Greensboro, High Point, and Winston-Salem) North Carolina (NC) (Bailey, 2002; Raper, 2009). There are now five major Montagnard tribes in NC (Jarai, Rhade, Bunong, Koho, and Bahnar), each speaking a distinct language. The continued use of the umbrella term “Montagnard” by the U.S. military followed these refugees to America. Their connection with the military yielded sponsorship and support for U.S. resettlement from veterans in NC. This, coupled with efforts of local faith-based organizations and resettlement agencies during the 1990s and 2000s, contributed to the NC establishment of the largest single community of Montagnards (>10,000 individuals) outside of Southeast Asia. Most of this population is concentrated in Greensboro, a city in Guilford County, NC, with a long history of civil rights activism (Bailey, 2002; Corby, 2010). First-generation Montagnard refugees came from rural and subsistence farming backgrounds (Andresen, 1988). Many had a third grade or lower literacy level (Bailey, 2002), which made the pathway to learning English quite challenging, particularly for preliterate elders (those accustomed to primarily oral communication in tribal languages). This difference in language and culture has resulted in isolation from English-speaking neighbors, limited knowledge of American law, local rules and customs, poor health literacy, limited access to health care, and curtailed employment opportunities for those economically responsible for households (Bailey, 2002). While the reported median family income for Guilford County Asian American families is $63,587 (Cone Health, 2022), this hardly reflects the state of many Montagnard families. There are extreme differences that exist across Asian American subgroup incomes, especially among Southeast Asians of refugee origin who occupy the lowest national Asian American income quintile, $17,743 (Austin, 2022). The Piedmont Triad boasts about its well-known teaching and academic research institutions, home to social-justice-focused Quaker and United Methodist colleges, two celebrated historically black colleges and universities with significant civil rights history, a minority serving institution, and a community college. Of its three cities, Greensboro has the largest concentration of Montagnards. It has the highest rates of high school graduates (about 90%) and college graduates (about 40%) (U.S. Census, 2017–2021). Despite this, Montagnard youth remain underrepresented and even invisible to most American educators and institutions of higher education in the region because they do not track their ethnic identity, tribal affiliation, or refugee origin. They are also sometimes mistaken for other Asian American subgroups or assumed to be the stereotypical “model minority” quiet high achievers. Disaggregated enrollment data that show numbers and trends for Montagnard college students do not exist currently. Community leaders indicate that individual Montagnard families, especially a few educated elites, have pushed their children to obtain a college education. However, for these college-going youth, the educational journey is quite often an exceptional and lonely experience, given the difficulty of “fitting in” and explaining to peers who they are. Individual resilience and emotional support from families might see them through navigating the degree-seeking process and graduation. For the rest, the challenges of social integration described above remain. This often results in economic pressures to go straight into low paying jobs rather than seeking higher education or specialized training. Since 2008, our team has included faculty researchers/mentors and students from area universities and local community researchers/advocates. We have worked extensively with the Montagnard community, where the specific aims are to facilitate community empowerment and agency, highlight their unique history, promote family and community health and wellness, and create awareness about and recognition of community members as experts in their culture, its preservation, language, history, and everyday life. These aims supersede many relationships previously built on resettlement agency goals such as self-sufficiency, acculturation, English language proficiency, and quick employment. The team's efforts have been less of a single program and more so a series of overlapping and flexible approaches to deliberately redefine our roles and relationships with political and religious leaders, elders, women, youth, and health professionals within the community. They also help to nurture and develop youth into confident, next-generation leaders. Montagnard youth aspirations are often underpromoted because they have few mentors or role models within their own tribal communities. Coming to a state with comparatively few Asians, first- or 1.5-generation Montagnard youth have been trailblazers with no maps, sometimes only partially aware of the insults and racial epithets cast at them, sometimes fully aware. In 2011, a Montagnard community health leader in the Greensboro area approached area researchers and community advocates for technical assistance with addressing chronic disease prevalence in their community. Of particular concern was the perception of widespread hypertension in family members, even among young adults. The Montagnard Hypertension project evolved in response to this community prioritized concern. This inaugural CBPR project involved collaboration across diverse stakeholders: Montagnard medical professionals (who trained in Vietnam, but cannot practice in the United States), community health workers (mothers and grandmothers), the Women's Learning Group (women attending ESOL classes), tribal elders, church leaders, Montagnard community youth/college students, and non-Montagnard students and faculty researchers/mentors across disciplines in higher education campuses. For the purposes of our project, we operationalized CBPR into a process that could both meet this community where it was, and support the varied community interests, motivations, roles, and development of capacities. Additionally, we implemented strategies best suited for work across three main tribal language groups (Jarai, Rhade, and Bunong), as well as with preliterate and limited-English-proficient (LEP) members and households. Our CBPR goals were to document much needed baseline data, uncover new information about factors driving the hypertension problem, create additional opportunities for building trust, and better mobilize community resources (i.e., the high school and college age youth who were “natural helpers” and represented highly knowledgeable language and cultural experts across tribal communities). With modest funding through multiple institutional mechanisms, we launched a four-phase interdisciplinary project between 2013 and 2015 which engaged more than 30 college youth. The phased project included (a) the “Hypertension Terminology” project for developing a “dictionary” of parallel Montagnard/English terminology for general health and hypertension; (b) a focus group discussion (FGD) phase to check specialized terminology and confirm community consensus about the problem; (c) the development, approval, and deployment of a culturally relevant and cognitively tested behavioral risk factor survey; and (d) the biological sample and behavioral data collection in households and community settings. Specific details of the research design and data collection process can be found in the original publication (Morrison et al., 2018), which includes Montagnard youth as coauthors. Our project aimed to build the capacity of Montagnard youth as rising professionals and community leaders by empowering them to understand how research could benefit their community, learn to safeguard community interests and agendas in research partnerships, and how to engage their cultural and language expertise through all steps of the research process. During this project, our team (as described above) trained the student researcher group, which consisted of Montagnard and other college youth (African American, African, Asian, Latinx, mixed race, international, immigrant, refugee, and from low-income backgrounds) in human subjects' protection through institutional IRB certifications and provided instruction on conducting literature searches. We also trained the student researcher group in facilitation of FGDs, their transcription, translation, and analysis, and in survey development, which was guided by the results of literature reviews and the FGDs. Montagnard youth identified more culturally relevant items and wording for measures of interest, and worked alongside the other students to assemble, assess, adjust, and administer the survey in multigenerational households, with a special concern for elders who were preliterate and/or LEP. For example, the Montagnard students created short videos with simply worded tribal language scripts for the informed consent process with such elders. We trained all students to collect anthropometric (height, weight, and waist circumference) and biological measures (blood pressure, saliva, and hair samples). Montagnard youth practiced collection and measurement activities, using each other as examples to ensure culturally sensitive and respectful data collection encounters with participants. They also trained the other students on the team to implement these sensitive and respectful practices. In many instances, we (the researchers/mentors) yielded to the wisdom of Montagnard youth, given their familiarity with tribal language, cultural customs, and taboos associated with touching the human body. They also coordinated teams for data collection and entry with faculty supervision to foster peer learning and accountability. As mentors we also provided opportunities for all the students' professional development through service learning, community engagement experiences, financial support for student scholarships, and travel to disseminate findings at local, state, and national conferences. We oversaw internships, independent studies, honors theses, and service-learning as capacity-building vehicles for student-led inquiry and community practice. We counseled youth about career opportunities, especially those that would better serve their community. We wrote letters of recommendation for scholarships, graduate and professional study, and jobs. We celebrated our collective hard work with recognition ceremonies for those graduating or advancing to the next level of professional training. This intense mentorship had direct influence on the young peoples' career and professional development, as well as community leadership trajectories. For example, Montagnard student team members gained achievements such as winning awards for research presentations, admission to graduate and professional programs (e.g., social work and public health), and emerged as senior leaders within local health departments and community nonprofit organizations. As the project progressed, faculty mentor awareness and understanding of historical and community politics increased. The Montagnards' complex tribal dynamics that stem from identity politics and differences in leadership styles have been heavily shaped by Western and American influences, notably Christian missionaries and the U.S. military. This is not uncommon among refugee-origin communities as leadership is contingent upon the prevailing conditions before and after arrival in the United States. For example, Montagnard community leadership originally included government officials, doctors, teachers, and others who held these former titles while living in Vietnam. However, when they arrived in the United States, their leadership experience was often not formally recognized by the American system, nor did they propose how their experience could be applied in new ways in their new country to help themselves or their community. Thus, their former leadership roles were no longer recognized when they arrived in America. Some obstacles were obvious for those who were leaders in their professions. For example, U.S. licensure and certification standards require advanced English language skills, strong familiarity with American professional practices and unwritten customs, and financial resources to pass recertification exams. Furthermore, U.S. resettlement policies prioritize employment for individuals almost immediately upon their arrival, coupled with limited and temporary financial support, with no pathway to recertification of credentials acquired overseas. This led to Montagnard doctors, who had been trained in Vietnam medical schools and held leadership positions, working in warehouses and nail shops. Finally, enduring system bias, corrosive mainstream American stereotypes about Asian Americans, and our region's long history of racism and discrimination (e.g., admission of black patients into our local hospital required a Supreme Court case, Simkins v Cone, 1963) remain entrenched obstacles. These, combined with the largely unchallenged social narrative of “Americans rescuing refugees,” have created “collective amnesia” about reasons for the global refugee stream. The history and experience of refugee communities, and the ongoing responsibilities of receiving societies to support and acculturate refugees in the longer term, have resulted in a “quiet neglect” of the needs of resettled refugees in the United States (Yamashita, 2021). Pastorship and membership in quasi-military associations, especially for Montagnard men and some women who fought alongside U.S. special forces during the Vietnam War, represented two pathways of becoming respected leaders. In the United States, during the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, young men who joined the military were highly praised for following in their fathers' and grandfathers' footsteps. Historically, the unifying factor for older and younger Montagnard men's ideas of leadership is their partnership with Americans in the Vietnam War, an event that caused the destruction of almost all their villages, the loss of their ancestral lands, thousands of deaths, and finally, abandonment by the U.S. government as U.S. troops left. Those who were able to flee to the United States represented a tiny fraction of those who made up their villages' leadership. However, in the United States too, the generational divide in notions and goals of leadership persisted. Next-generation Montagnard youth are often caught in the crossfire of these tensions. By their own indications, the elders and religious leaders in their tribal communities are skeptical of them. Elders hold high expectations of youth fidelity to traditional cultural and familial norms; thus, Montagnard college students must balance or negotiate these high expectations with their own academic, career, and leadership aspirations. Trapped between their elders' expectations and an unsupportive American environment, when given the chance, they candidly discussed these intergenerational disagreements and conflicts with researchers/mentors during the CBPR project debriefing sessions. Such talks were often spontaneous and informal and based on related topics they felt safe and free to expand upon. While they remained committed to participating in the CBPR project, they suggested that we prepare for potential disruptions due to obligation conflicts. For example, if we and the team needed to agree on a common time and meeting place, Montagnard students might explain why they could not meet, perhaps because they were needed back home to help with house cleaning, care of siblings or elders, church, or part-time jobs. The other college youth who were part of the research team would join in to talk about their lives and generational pressures as a way of demonstrating empathy and solidarity with Montagnard youth. As faculty researchers/mentors, we at first saw these internal issues as threats to successful and reliable project implementation. However, we soon felt that we were not in a position to resolve or eliminate conflicts as outsiders. Therefore these “safe space” exchanges were permitted and even encouraged throughout the data collection process as we learned their value in building trust, team unity, commitment to purpose, and leadership. We also pivoted our attention to developing youth leadership competencies around the use of time-tested CT approaches (dialog, negotiation, and mediation) with their elders during the CBPR project. For example, in partnership with faculty at other area colleges, and with guidance from more mature Montagnard young adults, we organized an intergenerational gathering in a large banquet room of a local restaurant that was frequented by Montagnard families. Each elder was seated with a small group of Montagnard and other college youth from the research team for more intimate dialog during the meal. Faculty mentors then facilitated an open dialog between Montagnard youth and key elders across tribal communities. Youth prepared and read short speeches that (a) emphasized respect and gratitude for elder contributions and sacrifices, (b) outlined CT strategies for intergenerational trust building and collaboration, and (c) expressed commitment to cultural preservation. Within this negotiated mediation space, each elder candidly spoke about both their appreciation and concerns for youth. They primarily worried about youth inclination and capacity to continue in helping roles with situations impacting Montagnard elders and families. For example, families continued to see chronic medical bills significantly impact household stability and well-being. Elders needed help from their linguistically and technologically savvy youth with negotiating these costs and handling health payment systems. Non-Montagnard youth acted as observers and witnesses as is common in these processes. At the end of the CT dialog, we found ourselves championing youth leadership for the community education and outreach work that accompanied CBPR, impressing upon elders the continued need for their shared wisdom. As nonaligned outsiders, we offered advice and support that we hoped would reduce future intergenerational disputes and promote trust building for community action. Although the Montagnard Hypertension project has since concluded, youth involvement and leadership in health-related CBPR and other collaborative health initiatives remain strong across our ongoing academic-refugee community partnerships and within our region. In fact, in 2015, Montagnard college students and working youth from different tribal backgrounds, and across local educational institutions in Guilford County NC, started the Montagnard American Organization (MAO) with the intention of (a) breaking away from the original community nonprofit, Montagnard Dega Association (MDA) that had been started by their elders in the 1980s and (b) unifying Montagnard youth across language, tribal, and church affiliation. MAO's inaugural leader (who came to the United States in her early teens) was instrumental in coordinating student research teams for survey data collection during our CBPR project. During her role as a student researcher, she was an important influencer to younger Montagnards just beginning their college studies and uncertain about their student status in the community. She graduated with a Bachelors in Social Work and joined the MDA main organization as a program coordinator. She later completed her Masters in Social Work, successfully obtained her Clinical Social Work licensure, and most recently became MDA's Executive Director (ED) when the original ED retired after 35 years of serving in that role. The MAO has since transitioned to being the youth branch of the MDA, with emphasis on community involvement, cultural pride and preservation, job and career planning, training and education, college readiness and application assistance, and overall successful life skills. MAO youth leaders have now charted a way forward in times of crisis, as seen through more recent youth mobilization and deployment of resources to address COVID-19 challenges across tribal communities. As research mentors to more than 45+ college students, we recognize that community context, as well as family and intergenerational support, all contribute to successful and socially engaged youth. If Montagnard youth are to thrive, then we as researchers/mentors must continue to offer practical and feasible mechanisms such as CBPR and CT through which leadership and capacity for social action and change among refugee-origin communities can be enacted.

experienced the COVID-19 lockdown as well as the beginning of rising inflation and energy price increases. These themes were also present in the literature published that year, which addressed the impact of shifts in which terms of trade and policy responses to currency and other economic pressures were dominant features. The context of the renegotiation of Britain's economic relations with other nations and an increasingly diverse society were other common areas of study, incorporating both the influence of European integration on business and consumer taste as well as the impacts of decolonization and Commonwealth immigration. An analysis of long-term patterns of inflation was developed by Forbes et al., who found that a ‘trendy’ (p. 23) rather than more prescriptive approach was beneficial to understanding the complex factors which have shaped the value of sterling over time. They concluded that given the nature of Britain's comparatively open economy and dependency on imports and monetary flows, international prices and exchange rates have been the dominant factor that explain Britain's inflation dynamics in recent decades. Bahmani-Oskooee and Karamelikli's research on bilateral trading relationships between Britain and eurozone economies found that exchange rate fluctuations had divergent effects on the trade balance. Nevertheless, sterling depreciation was broadly negative for the UK's position. In a paper published in the Scottish Journal of Political Economy, Bahmani-Oskooee et al. concluded that between 1996 and 2018, short-run exchange rate effects in terms of dollar–pound volatility had an observable impact on trade across a large range of industries. These statistical studies were complemented by archival research on shifts in monetary policy. Butkiewicz and Ohlmacher's Economic History Review paper used new evidence from the Nixon White House tapes to better understand responses to the currency crisis that led to the end of the Bretton Woods system. It found British requests for support against the impact of dollar devaluation on sterling impacted discussions and shaped Nixon's choice to impose wage–price controls as part of a distraction from the realities of a devaluation through shifts in the dollar exchange rate. Aliber's paper on the summit Nixon hosted at Camp David in August 1971 indicates that Nixon had hoped to alter exchange rates to favour American exports, but in fact, devaluation only led to an influx of foreign purchases of US securities, contributing to the United States subsequently becoming the world's largest debtor. In another study on ‘unintended consequences’ (p. 620), Tomlinson suggested in an article for Contemporary British History that the rapid acceleration of deindustrialization during the first term of the Thatcher government was not a deliberate result of economic policy. Nevertheless, these changes were later rationalized in terms of Britain enjoying competitive advantages within service sectors whilst trade unions and industrial workers were held morally responsible for manufacturing job losses. Tomlinson emphasized continuities in Twentieth Century British History. National economic management, in the form of state action to avert the precarities and inequities associated with growing dependency on the global economy, has remained a significant feature of Britain's political economy since the mid-twentieth century, perhaps being strengthened as globalization intensified during the 1990s and 2000s. Whisker contributed to historicizing debates over the national economic model through an account of discussions concerning emulating West Germany's liberalized markets, high growth, and low inflation within the Conservative Party from the mid-1970s to early 1980s. Disquiet over the role of organized labour in industrial governance as well as distinct interpretations between party factions characterized this discussion. Torp explored the pension crises Britain and Germany experienced in the 2000s; finding, however, that the problems were distinctive: Britain's rested primarily on the prolonged falling value of state benefits whilst Germany's related to demographic shifts and reunification. Buller and Whisker provided another account of divergence, this time focused on distrust between the Bank of England and the Treasury. Archival evidence suggests these sentiments were crucial in Conservative governments’ reluctance to embrace central bank independence between 1979 and 1997. Evemy et al. suggested that under central bank independence, monetary policy has been used to discipline labour and reward the financial sector. Since the great recession, Bank of England policy has promoted the continuation of a political economy centred on low wages and high rates of indebtedness. The aftermath of the Mirlees review into taxation during the same period was addressed by Borbely in a study of the impact of changes to Scottish stamp duty. His conclusions underlined that patterns of property market participation demonstrated resultant changes, but that shifts were far more notable towards the bottom of the market. Bedford addressed another area of regulation, that is, gambling, in New Political Economy, arguing the centrality of women's participation in games such as bingo to legislative reforms since the mid-twentieth century, who have so far been overlooked in accounts centred on male-dominated sports betting. Writing for the same journal, Shilliam analysed Enoch Powell as ‘Britain's first neoliberal politician’ (p. 239) underlining the importance of understanding connections between racism, right-wing populism, and the embrace of market forces in the late twentieth century. Aqui et al. addressed Powell's constitutional outlook, highlighting the connection between his domestic and foreign policy approaches. Commitments to a sovereign centralized state provided a common link between his opposition to close relations with the Commonwealth, the EEC, and devolution. A special edition of Contemporary British History assessed British–European relations from multifaceted perspectives. Moss and Clarke examined Mass Observation Archive material from 1982, midway between the 1975 referendum and Thatcher's 1988 Bruges speech, finding a popular Euroscepticism predominated over agricultural policy, food prices, regulation, and bureaucracy. Other contributors emphasized expanding cultural palettes. Hollows wrote an article on European food consumption during the 1960s and 1970s whilst Fabian explored the growth of package holidays which contributed to increasing luxury consumptions. Fuhg concluded that developments in the London fashion scene had anticipated these developments through the embrace of continental trends since the early 1960s. More recent trajectories towards trade disintegration were recorded by Graziano et al., who concluded the tariff impact of Brexit had a marked impact in reducing export levels. Fuller found that businesses had responded to the tense political atmosphere these changes have created by devolving responsibility for Brexit to British subsidiaries and pursuing a consensual approach. Decolonization emerged as another dominant theme, including in a Business History special edition on India. Abdelrehim et al. found that the Burmah Oil Company's continuation of colonial hiring practices contributed to the eventual nationalization of its Indian subsidiary in 1976. Contrastingly, Aldous and Roy reported a range of divestment and investment strategies were followed by firms in response to growing ‘Indianisation’ pressures during the 1970s. Masrani et al. concluded that British strategies to exclude Indian competition high-tech and high-value-added sectors broadly failed. Nkhoma's assessment of agriculture in Malawi recorded that colonial officials succeeded in orientating agricultural production firstly to food production in the context of the Second World War and immediate post-war requirements before shifting back to cash crops to meet the needs of the sterling area in the 1950s. Global industrial connections were the subject of a study by Tenold et al., who demonstrated that South Korean shipbuilding engineers who later became world leaders learned practical experience through work placements at Scott Lithgow's yard in Greenock on Clydeside. Donnelly et al. examined the less successful history of Rootes’ expansion through purchasing other engineering firms before falling into a vicious circle of foreign direct investment and neglecting British plants during the 1960s and 1970s. Boyns found that regulatory changes and mounting competition ended British Racing Motors’ run of Formula One success in the 1960s, prefiguring disestablishment in 1977. Tsang traced the evolution of the UK gaming industry through small clusters of hobbyists turned entrepreneurs which highlights the role of foreign multinationals and universities in creating opportunities for British firms. Debates over the British political economy animated several articles. Arch concluded that whilst competition between retail banks was limited, there was nevertheless considerable innovation before further mergers were permitted in the late 1960s. Kern and Schnyder found engagement with network-shaped patterns of industrial lending before the 1980s, after which it ceased to figure. In an article on British pub business models, Bower detailed the rise and fall of the conglomerate from the 1960s to 1980s, finding that since, family-owned breweries and PubCo chains have been shaped by models of selective merging and acquisition. Rowling and Ramsden identified two distinctive sets of relationships in agriculture between Northern Yorkshire's small family-owned farms on the one hand, and on the other, the Eastern Riding's large arable farms which contributed to distinctive patterns of inequality and sense of place during the mid-twentieth century. Britain's fishing fleet became increasingly dependent on subsidies following their exclusion from Icelandic waters over 1949–50, which Wilcox explains triggered a major increase in public support. Abrams and Gardner emphasize the endurance of craft tradition in Shetland, underlining that knitting remained an important sector, especially for women, before the oil industry developed during the 1970s and 1980s. The arrival of domestic knitting machines allowed knitters to produce for buyers outwith Shetland, prefiguring the later embrace of craft status and cache of Fair Isle branding. Linda Ross detailed the coming of a different energy industry, that is, nuclear, to the far north of the Scottish mainland. Thurso became ‘Atom Town’ in the 1950s and 1960s, with Caithnessians largely welcoming the development of the experimental reactor at Dounreay and the jobs-based emigration into the area promoted by the Atomic Energy Authority. Whilst Thurso was booming, agricultural towns in Lincolnshire experienced depression. Bonnettee's study of Anglican church redundancy in the English Midlands underlines links with rural depopulation and agricultural mechanization as well as esoteric parish decision-making behind stories of the abandonment of individual buildings. Ewen and Andrews examined how memory and historical interpretation shape the remaking of place. Their research on the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire and its commemoration notes that it came to serve as a community-forming event, emphasizing the city's increasingly multicultural status. In Fenwick's study of the Sheffield International Documentary Festival, another response to socioeconomic change in late twentieth-century Yorkshire reveals how the art event configured a form of private and public sector cooperation which became a model for later urban regeneration. Beel and Jones detailed the inefficiencies on a persistent focus on the city centre in Swansea policymaking since the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government in the early 2010s, which has encouraged uneven development and brittle linkages. Davoudi and Brooks delineated between what they term ‘economic’ and ‘city centric’ views in the scaling of UK regional policymaking, underlining the conflict between them and distinctions between elite and popular conceptions. Bissoondeeal et al. assessed patterns of regional inequalities and house prices. They revealed a separate pattern of property market developments in London from the rest of the UK, noting, however, a tendency for a negative spillover from London to other parts of the country. Hearne's research on real incomes found that regional differences within Britain are far greater in nominal terms than real ones after price impacts are factored in, but do draw attention to the centralization of political and economic power. Bracke and Tenreyro demonstrated the strength of historical dependency in the English and Welsh housing market, finding that patterns of price and sale propensities are impacted by the price in the period in which properties were bought in the past. Qualitative histories of housing assessed how residents and authorities shaped public understanding of homes in the second half of the twentieth century. Cartwright detailed tension between the ideals of a property-owning democracy on the one hand and rising concern about safety in multiple occupancy buildings on the other in an article about London County Council fire precautions in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Hazley et al. used oral histories from the Wyndford estate in Glasgow to challenge the dominance of contemporary architectural critics in histories of high-rises. Current and former residents fondly recalled both enhanced privacy in contrast with the tenements the high flats replaced and community built in zoned areas of neighbourliness. Mazzotta and Parisi concluded that the UK sat within a European pattern of adult children returning to the parental home during and immediately following the great recession. Historical economic geography studies underlined how industrial performances related to technological change. Tranos et al. used panel data on digital content creation beginning in the year 2000 to conclude that there were considerable first-mover advantages. Focacci and Kirov's Local Economy article studied transitions in sectoral clusters, comparing the West Midlands automotive industry with Sofia's ICT cluster. They found that a mature car industry survived in the UK through restructuring and local and national state intervention which enabled it to retain a technological advantage. Gagliardi et al. outlined the uneven nature of pressure from outward foreign direct investment in the Journal of Economic Geography. Their study showed that workers in routinized jobs and within industries marked by regional specializations are particularly vulnerable to outwards foreign direct investment. By contrast, there was no significant impact on job creation in non-routinized tasks. Studies of specific sites and workplaces outline how the UK's built environment relates to its shifting political priorities and power relations. In De Vane's study of Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, he underlines the centrality of planning and land use to understanding the development of the welfare state. Pilgrim was built with high levels of public support but also demonstrated the importance of controversy, local opinion, and decentralized planning systems to understanding the National Health Service. Vernon's Past and Present article about Heathrow posits that the airport was central to the making of neoliberal Britain. Not only was it the first airport in the world to be privatized in 1986, but it had also been subject to a longer reliance on an increasingly precarious ethnic minority workforce in roles such as catering and security. Stories of migrant labour and struggles against racist prejudices were studied in Babikian's account of British nurses. The Health Service was founded with a shortage of tens of thousands of nurses, which created a lasting labour market for healthcare workers from Britain's current and former colonies. Lomas recorded, however, though that into the late 1960s and after, civil servants from ethnic minority backgrounds continued to face prejudice. His paper in The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History records the suspicious attitudes shown towards BAME applicants for work within GCHQ and other areas of intelligence. Nott's Social History of Medicine article demonstrates that the continued belief in a protein gap within African diets, centred on quantity not quality, continued in some quarters into the 1970s. Important changes to medical services and the politics of healthcare are addressed in papers on developments under the National Health Service. Mueller studied the development of anaesthetic prescription in post-war Britain, finding that from the 1950s onwards the drug became a component of professional identity building for pharmacists as their numbers grew in a new institutional environment. Burchell's article on child psychologists tells a more ambiguous story of how professionalization and medicalization is traced. Psychologists found themselves operating between therapy, diagnosis, and social worker roles and navigating the ends of both educational and healthcare provision, demonstrating the importance of the local state and challenging perceptions of a monolithic national welfare state. Opposition to abortion provides a different framing of political identities in 1980s Britain. Dee's research uses oral histories with anti-abortion activists to explore the significance of the marked failure of the parliamentary bill put forward by the Liverpudlian Liberal MP David Alton. The outcome was a major fissure in a previously comparatively cohesive movement, exposing a divide between those who favoured further legislative campaigns and others who pursued an extra-parliamentary approach. Changes in public and private morality informed other articles published in 2021. Lynch studied the response to the conviction of a 19-year-old man of having unlawful intercourse with a 19-year-old woman in Falkirk during the late 1960s. Whilst this caused much distress and outcry, evangelical Christians were unable to capitalize on the feeling it generated, demonstrating the increasingly secular nature of Scottish society. Shifting attitudes towards AIDS during the 1980s and 1990s informed two further articles. Elizabeth wrote an account of the 1987 Love Carefully: Use a Condom leaflet produced amid rising fears that young heterosexual couples were at growing risk of infection. Her analysis emphasizes the perceived value of authenticity and emotional sensitivity to reaching the desired audience. In another paper for Twentieth Century British History, Elizabeth assesses a storyline of the children's television soap opera Grange Hill from 1995. This empathetic portrayal of a child suffering from AIDS aimed to attend to a subject of growing public concern. Miller explored the legitimating of another formerly taboo subject, parental divorce. He found that from the late 1960s onwards, the children of divorced parents were less frequently understood as delinquents but also extended increasing sympathy within the growing genre of divorce self-help books. Other papers detailed less optimistic accounts of social change. Fevre's article details how Black residents of Liverpool responded to three days of racist rioting by whites in 1948, which nevertheless ended in the arrest of several Black men. Legal defence committees sprung up in response, setting a precedent for later occurrences during the 1970s and 1980s. Rhodes addresses the theme of bisexuality in 1970s Britain, finding that the radical Gay Liberation Front was intolerant of multiple-gender attraction and that the Campaign for Homosexual Equality also evolved towards a similar position over the decade. Giusta et al. concluded pessimistically on the attempts to criminalize demand for sex work in Scottish, English, and Welsh legal contexts, arguing that evidence suggests that the law was an insufficient deterrence. The development of inequalities was another continuing theme in the literature. Tinkler addressed the increasing role of mobility in representations of modernity and young womanhood in the late 1950s and 1960s. Physical mobility became positively associated with freedom and risk-taking. Important divisions emerged between portrayals of those who were seen as mobile as against women who were socially and physically immobile. Jaillant's research on the PN Review, a Manchester-based poetry magazine, demonstrates the impact of shifts in public policy and growing pressure for gender equality. Feminist poets were included in the magazine in larger numbers, publishing pieces denouncing their previous marginality, as cuts to arts subsidies led to increased demands for more diverse contributions during the 1980s. Clark's discussion of the Whitehall studies into the health of British civil servants reveals an increasing awareness of class-based health inequalities over the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, especially through the greater levels of stress experienced further down the social ladder. These findings contrast with the broader trend towards the disavowal of class as a significant feature of British society over the period. In the British Journal of Industrial Relations, Jones et al. demonstrate that disabled workers felt the impact of the great recession worse, compounding existing disadvantages. The outcomes applied in terms of workloads, wages, and access to training outcomes even after adjusting for job position and sector. Banks et al. also concluded that patterns of inequality were becoming more entrenched in an assessment of mortality in England from 2003 to 2016. Mortality fell across age groups but in an uneven manner, with especially marked inequality growth visible among both women over the age of 65 and men over 80. Avoidable death rates remained far above those of comparable European countries. In contrast to these precise measurements, Moseley's research on perceptions of healthy eating in the second half of the twentieth century demonstrates the proliferation of far more varied understandings, detailing a significant contrast between vernacular and medial perspectives. Studies of wealth and income also revealed spiralling levels of inequality. Advani et al. found that the UK was impacted by high and growing rates of wealth inequality, highlighting that survey measures tend to underestimate the wealth of the wealthiest, making it difficult to fully understand or change persistent and self-reinforcing patterns. Morris et al.’s research on executive pensions found that there have been significant changes since legislation in 2006 accelerated the end of defined benefit schemes, which were replaced by other forms of compensation. Defined benefit pensions encouraged long service and created stronger connections between executive performance and pay. This link has resultantly diminished since the mid-2000s. Pay inequalities are magnified by firm size. Green et al. concluded that firm size positively correlated with levels of compensation, but that these benefits are concentrated disproportionately further up the hierarchy. Moor and Friedman investigated growing intergenerational wealth gaps through interviewing London homeowners who benefitted from family inheritances. They noted that their interviewees relied on subjectively repositioning themselves to fit their own positions into meritocratic ideals by appealing to more humble family origins. Studies of welfare reforms since the 2008 financial crisis uncovered an increasingly disciplinarian turn in policymaking towards those who lacked such means. Mills and Klein detailed the punishment-based deterrence that has been built into UK welfare regimes to deter applications. Pemberton has drawn complementary conclusions, emphasizing that the reform of benefit payments into Universal Credit under the Conservative–Liberal Democratic coalition government made new demands of financial responsibility on claimants. Koch and Reeves also studied universal credit, emphasizing that the impact of coalition-era welfare reform was to make social security more insecure, rendering workers more reliant on their employers. Beynon et al. traced the long-term impact of trade union membership in Britain's former coalfield regions, concluding that levels of union organization remained among the highest in Britain decades after final colliery closures in some areas. These findings point to the long-term influence of place in explaining dynamics of political economy. Gall emphasized that the early twenty-first century has been accompanied by the significant deployment of anti-trade union tactics by the employer. In an article for Capital & Class, he details employers’ victimization of union activists through suspensions and sackings between 1998 and 2018, finding that both were used. These weapons stand alongside the better-understood blacklist. Employer hostility towards organized labour has longstanding precedent along with government anxieties over workplace disorder. Lyddon's account of the Wilson government's In Place of Strife white paper assesses the suggestions of imposing fines on unions over refusal to ballot members before taking industrial action as well as during demarcation disputes and for taking industrial action during conciliation pauses. Looking over the Heath government's subsequent failure to enforce the Industrial Relations Act, which took some of these proposals forward, Lyddon concludes that they were impractical in the face of sustained opposition. Smith's article on the labour lawyer Bill Wedderburn examines his tenacious defence of the right to strike under the Trade Disputes Act 1906 after the 1961 Rookes decision jeopardized the earlier legislation. Ultimately it was only the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1976 that fully recovered the position. Ferdosi develops scholarship on another long-running continuity through his assessment of employment protection legislation in Britain between the early 1960s and early 2010s. He concludes that there has been a long-term pattern of expanding formal protections, but that they have been accompanied by a failure in application, partly due to them being consciously offered as an alternative to trade unions by Conservative governments. Bryson and White's article on high-performance work systems in the public sector provides a case study of work intensification and reducing economic rewards, finding that these systems are associated with falling average wages alongside the adoption of new technologies and improved management performances. Union responses to deindustrialization emerged as another core theme in the 2021 literature. Phillips’ article on the Scottish engineering union activist Jimmy Airlie traces his contribution to working-class struggles for economic security through his time working in the Clydeside shipyards and in his later career as full-time union official responsible for workers in American-owned plants. A special edition of Labour History Review addressed factory occupations. Several papers discussed occupations during the 1980s which were responses to rising unemployment during that time. Clark assessed occupations led by women workers in Scotland during the early 1980s, Wright, Phillips, and Tomlinson discussed the occupation of the Timex plant in Dundee during 1983, and Muschin overviewed the development of the occupation tactic in response to plant closures. Gibbs explored the commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the Caterpillar factory in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, which took place during 1987. Tuckman provided an overview of the rise and decline of occupations since the 1970s, emphasizing that workers occupied factories in waves and that at their peak during the 1970s, occupations were used for offensive wages and condition demands as well as in defence of jobs and workplaces.",,Ewan Gibbs,false,,false,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/ehr.13234

sustainability. As a community-based activity led by citizens, the Okayama ESD project grows up to 260 establishments of community learning centers, CLCs or kominkans in implementing ESD in Okayama prefecture. The CLCs works closely with the school district and become the ESD hub for the school and some of kominkan become sources for the online lifelong learning center. In Okayama City, it is reported that more than ten percent of the population is involved in activities for making sustainable livelihood; where about 30,000 people are engaged in the sector of environmental protection, about 34,000 in the sector of promotion of gender equality, and about 7000 in the health promotion sector and many more. Concerning global environmental challenges, there are six thematic issues highlighted in the Okayama Commitments, namely: environmental conservation, disaster risk reduction (DRR), income generation, entrepreneurship, community development, cultural diversity and dialogue, intergenerational exchange, literacy, and empowerment. 
In April 2005, there was an agreement among experts and leaders, including researchers of universities in Okayama City to work together for the creation of a local base for the promotion of ESD. The Okayama ESD project governs by the Regional Centre of Expertise (RCE) Okayama and the Okayama Municipal Government. Further, the Okayama ESD Promotion Commission was established with the aim ‘‘to create a community where people learn, think and act together towards realizing a sustainable society’’ (Okayama ESD Promotion Commission 2014). The aim reflects the five elements of reorienting education for sustainability: knowledge, skills, perspectives, values, and issues. The Okayama Declaration on RCEs and ESD Beyond 2014, stated that RCEs are designed to achieve “systemic transformation by contributing to the realization of socially inclusive and equitable economies within the renewable capacity of the earth and planetary systems”. In 2016, the Okayama ESD Project received the UNESCO-Japan Prize on ESD and as a world leader in promoting ESD, it’s called the Okayama Model of ESD (ESD Success Story 2017). All of these interactions reflect the frontier of converging knowledge systems, network and sector of innovation driven by complex, non-linear and dynamic processes of knowledge creation, diffusion and use of the Okayama community. 
This active participation of citizens and multi-stakeholder involvement in Okayama prefecture inspire re-conceptualize, the ways, and means that knowledge production, utilization, and renewal take place in the context of the knowledge economy and society (gloCal knowledge economy and society). In the context of knowledge production and innovation, the Okayama model of ESD may challenges the conventional method of education system as a sole knowledge provider or mode 1 knowledge production (traditional research by universities) (Godin & Gingras, 2000) and also mode 2 knowledge production (knowledge that is generated when mode 1 knowledge is applied and put into practice) (Gibbons et al., 1994; Nowotny, Scott, & Gibbons, 2003). In another way, the Okayama ESD project reflects mode 3 of the knowledge production system (Carayannis & Campbell 2009) which lead by kominkans or community ESD as a democratization of knowledge related to a sustainable livelihood in the structured five knowledge sub-system. The five sub-systems interact in the Quintuple Helix model are i. the educational system, which generates and disseminates new knowledge; ii. the economic system, which controls, possesses and generates economic capital; iii. the political system, which has political and legal capital (e.g., laws, clearances, policy, public goods); iv. civil society, which has the social capital, and is characterized by traditions, values, and behavioral patterns; and v. the natural environment, which has natural capital (e.g., natural resources, climate, air quality, geological stability) (Carayannis, Barth, & Campbell, 2012). 
Several kominkan case study reflects the knowledge co-creation and dynamic interactions among sub-system. For example, the case study of Seno Kominkan in raising a community of Seno and Mishima districts as a new residential area was performed by sharing with them their local history, ‘water wells map’. The initiative by local residents explores historically the important water sources, how local people in the past took good care of water throughout their lives, thus deepening their knowledge of local resources. The case study of Saidaiji Kominkan operates by providing the volunteer training course ‘Udon School’ to help residents make friends and find motivation in life after retirement. Participants focus on learning how to make Udon noodles and soup and open ‘Udon Cafe’ in a popular shopping area which slowly going out of business. Further, the initiative re-develop community businesses, which will lead to the revitalization of the local community. This an example of input from cultural-based knowledge creation that brings into the economic system by creating new jobs and growth by reviving the local food culture ‘Udon’. The quintuple helix analysis will identify the input, output, knowledge creation and innovation for each sub-system. In the end, the new model of Okayama Quintuple Helix analysis will provide various types of knowledge for a selected case study at local kominkans, Okayama prefecture. 
By using the quintuple helix analysis, gaps in implementing knowledge-based society will identify for further improvement of the Okayama Model of ESD. The Okayama Quintuple Helix Model of ESD is a platform for the manifestation of inter- and transdisciplinary approaches of co-creation, co-evolution, and co-implementation of knowledge for sustainability-driven by various actors. It will enhance other actor’s performance as a knowledge producer as well as knowledge users towards the democratization of knowledge which crucial in the eco-societal-transition of the society. Hence, revisit the Okayama Model of ESD by using the Quintuple Helix model to help in strengthening the existing model in the context of knowledge-based society for further eco-innovation and eco-entrepreneurship of inter- and transdisciplinary platform. It may give a different insight into ESD especially in reorientation education for sustainability in more structure manner.",,,false,,false,,

AND BUDDHIST: WHAT BUDDHISM CAN TEACH US ABOUT RACE, RESILIENCE, TRANSFORMATION, AND FREEDOM. Edited by Pamela Ayo Yetunde and Cheryl A. Giles. Boulder, CO: Shambhala Publications, 2020Pp. 189. $19.95. The anthology Black & Buddhist begins with a tribute, ""In Honor of George Floyd, which recounts the merciless torture that culminated in the murder of an unarmed Black man in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020. This egregious violation of human rights, captured in vivid videos, began to circulate almost immediately around the world and powerfully' ""shocked the conscience of humanity,"" igniting weeks of outrage and protests (xi). With penetrating insight, Yetunde and Giles thus set the stage for a rich and varied discussion of race through Black and Buddhist eyes, recounting historical highlights of racism in the United States and the apathy and ignorance that were shattered in eight minutes for millions of viewers. Against this backdrop, the editors unfurl some of the important themes that serve as links between Buddhism and the experience of persecuted and marginalized peoples. The most obvious link is the suffering of dehumanization and hatred that Black people perpetually endure. ""By watching Black and brown bodies die by police violence without resistance, we slowly die too. We take in resignation, despair, depression, self-denial, and self-effacement, and our bodies become bloated by powerlessness,"" they write (xv). Further, they link the Buddhist practice of satipattana, mindfulness of breathing, with Floyd's repeated cries of ""I can't breathe."" Emphasizing the intimacy and immediacy of the simple act of breathing, they say, ""Our resistance to oppression is our right to breathe freely. … In honor of George Floyd and countless others, we vow to breathe. We breathe for the well-being of all sentient beings"" (xv). They conclude with a dedication of merit, aspiring to use the ""gifts of Buddhist practice"" for the benefit of others (xv). Gaylon Ferguson, in the book's Foreword, identifies suffering as the origin of both the Black experience in America and the teachings of the Buddha—a common denominator that generates a deep commitment to healing and liberation. He likens the book to a ""feast of inspiration and insight, tenderness and truth, courage and compassion …, a message of peace, a strong peace with justice and dignity,"" offering an alternative means of dealing with ""experiences of fear, anxiety, worry, and despair"" (xvii). Ferguson reflects meaningfully on each chapter of the book, giving the reader a preview of the feast that lies ahead. He directly raises some contested issues, such as Lama Dawa Tarchin Phillips' contention that the liberated mind is beyond color. This assertion is analogous to the parallel claim that the liberated mind is beyond gender. Certainly, liberation does not literally erase color, nor does liberation erase gender. Even though a liberated mind is presumed to be beyond the limitations and biases of prejudice toward skin tone and gender, in the socialization process, including injustices encountered on the ground, color and gender matter very much. Dawa Tarchin Phillips concurs, recognizing the importance of dealing with feelings of trauma and shame encountered in one's personal experience, especially ""feelings of inadequacy, unworthiness, and shame,"" as Jan Willis discovered (xviii). As several contributors suggest, solidarity with compassionate Dharma friends who share similar hurtful or traumatic life experiences can be a major factor in healing. In their Introduction, Yetunde and Giles present an analysis of Buddhist principles alongside African slave history to explain how Buddhist practices may be relevant to the experience of African Americans. They begin by observing that ""Buddhism emerged from a caste-oriented culture in which a powerful man of color renounced his power, woke up to his delusions, grew in compassion, and committed himself to teaching a way of life for all to awaken … a path to de-caste or decolonize one's mind while simultaneously helping oneself build resilience against trauma"" (1). Their aim is to explore how these practices can be applied in exploitative capitalist societies to nurture spiritually integrated human beings, especially in the face of trauma. To do this, they examine the experience of trauma, which in the Buddhist context inevitably entails a discussion of self and no-self, soul and no-soul, landing on an understanding of the interdependence of all beings as key to resilience. The Buddha may not have used the language of trauma, but his primary realization, the First Noble Truth, reveals the essence of suffering, the trauma of life itself. The book hinges on one central fact: ""There is a trauma of being alive and there is a trauma of being alive while Black"" (13). In Chapter 1, Cheryl A Giles unpacks the uncomfortable topic of sexual violence in the history, myths, and memories of enslaved peoples and the multiple intergenerational traumas that have resulted. As a clinical psychologist working with traumatized individuals and their families, she began to understand the effects of unresolved trauma in her own and her patients' thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. She developed a way to use that pain as a pathway to healing. Through stories and sharing her own family history, she makes the case that remembering the brutal history of enslavement and sexual violence is necessary for liberating oneself from intergenerational trauma. Giles' personal experience of working with profound grief at a Buddhist retreat demonstrates the effectiveness of the healing methods, insights, and benefits of mindfulness meditation that she learned for confronting distress. Chapter 1 also includes a review of the history of the #MeToo movement and the remarkable work of Tarana Burke, its founder. Using the practice of attention, deep listening, and the power of connection, Burke worked through her own experience of sexual trauma to become an ally and resource for countless others. In Chapter 2, ""The Dharma of Trauma,"" Lama Rod Owens tells of his experience with ayahuasca, a potent hallucinogenic plant used in traditional healing rituals. He recounts going to the Peruvian Amazon to mourn and let go of the first 40 years of his life, approaching the experience of purging with pure intention. Trauma, he says, is ""an experience that knocks you out of your body and makes it difficult to return""; for slave-descended folk like himself, it is ""a demon that possesses"" (47–48). In ordinary terms, his Blackness is a source of trauma, grief, and rage, but as a Buddhist practitioner, he recognizes the dilemma of identity: ""I want my Blackness to be supported by my dharma practice, not erased by it"" (47). Linking the narratives of liberation, sorrow, and love from the Bible and the Buddha's teachings, Owen pays tribute to the ancestors and offers a prayer that all beings in the world be free. Sebene Selassie takes an inward journey in Chapter 3, ""Turning Toward Myself."" She describes her experience growing up as a Habesha (Ethiopian/Eritrean) teenager in Washington, DC, and as a religious studies major at McGill University in Montreal. Interrogating concepts of race, religion, ethnicity, and Black racialization, she ultimately focuses on the question of how Blackness and Buddhism in tandem taught her to turn away from self-rejection and (re)turn to herself. She explains that turn as a natural evolution: ""Now I see how my longing for meaning was stirred by my discontent. That dis-ease sparked a search that led to Buddhism and Blackness"" (81). She concurs with Toni Morrison that racism is a distraction that diverts attention from one's work, for example, a sense of belonging ""like a tumbleweed"" (81). In Chapter 4, titled Belonging, Lama Dawa Tarchin Phillips also focuses on themes of human belonging and connection. He shares his journey and his ideas for reintegrating with lost parts of ourselves within the human family: ""the different faces, races, and creeds—we are striding through this planet like the walking wounded. … The inner signs of this amputated state are isolation, meaninglessness, loneliness, and depression. The outer signs are hatred, division, and violence"" (85–86). Phillips came to the realization that in order to help heal the planet, he needed to deepen his relationship with humanity and the Earth. He became convinced that ""In our liberated mind, we are free; we are beyond color"" (92). In ""Voluntary Segregation"" (Chapter 5), Pamela Ayo Yetunde reflects on her experiences of practicing and teaching in white Buddhist community settings. She reveals that initially, she was strongly opposed to the idea of People of Color (POC) or racially segregated communities, mirroring resistance from certain white participants. Despite a number of unpleasant experiences in white centers, being treated as ""invisible, incompetent, or unworthy of empathy"" (103), she persevered, using these experiences to gather insights into herself. For years, she took refuge in sitting alone (internalized apartheid?), until she eventually discovered solidarity in POC and LGBTQ communities. From years of being ""othered,"" she developed a strong practice of loving, kindness, and compassion, plus a wealth of wisdom about insecurity, intention, the dynamics of living in racist societies, and the need to decolonize Buddhism to help build healthier spiritual communities. In Chapter 6, Gyōzan Royce Andrew Johnson shares an unlikely (but perfectly understandable) transition: ""From Butcher to Zen Priest."" His transition was triggered by a life-threatening cut while washing dishes; the nightmarish pain of emergency treatment and close contact with dying patients sparked a major reality check. Johnson emerged from these traumas determined not to squander his life. His first encounter with meditation some months later was hilariously scary. He feared that the Sri Lankan monks he met could read his mind; ""The unexamined mind of a black butcher!"" (123). After a year of Buddhist practice, however, he began to see Zen as medicine and also protection against police brutality. In the next chapter, ""On Being Lailah's Daughter,"" Kamilah Majied tells the story of growing up with anxiety and many different types of grief, even while blessed with the encouraging support of a loving mother. All living beings experience the anxiety of simply being alive, but living with the anxiety of being alive while Black is more so. Majied learned to welcome her trembling heart, fears, and sorrows through her mother, who advised her to welcome struggle, all the while singing Billy Holiday's ""Good Morning Heartache."" Her mother's Buddhist practice and wisdom for transforming suffering laid the scaffolding for her own resilience. In the final chapter, ""Wholeness is No Trifling Matter,"" Ruth King examines the psychology of resistance to racism, both as personally experienced and as institutionally embedded. While professionally successful, she was full of rage at systemic injustice, and baffled by how it would all end. Early one morning in Cochin, South India, a chance encounter with His Holiness the Dalai Lama transformed her world. Profoundly moved, she thought, ""In this flawed world, it is possible to look upon others with pure heartedness and acceptance"" (160). Another chance encounter led her to Spirit Rock Meditation Center and years of intensive meditation practice, which culminated in her being recognized as a Buddhist teacher. The years of dedicated practice have not eliminated racial distress, which she calls ""the wounds of separation,"" but turning inward through mindfulness meditation has led to freedom from intense anger and fear. An understanding of the cycle of misperception has helped heal her conditioned judgments. These are righteous steps on the path of the bodhisattva, a being devoted to freeing others from suffering. Each contributor to this volume has awakened to the truth of suffering in their own way. Each has engaged, intellectually and viscerally, in confronting the pain of racism in their personal lives and in society. They speak as Buddhist teachers, mental health therapists, academics, meditation practitioners, and activists. They speak in honest, heartfelt voices about the experiences that led them to Buddhist practice and how the teachings have been liberating in facing the scars of racial hatred, violence, and ignorance. Their stories are priceless gifts for eradicating preconceptions and waking the rest of us up. While the personal narratives in Black and Buddhist may be best appreciated by those who have suffered or witnessed the brutality and painful wounds of racism, they may have an equally powerful impact on those who have not experienced what it feels like to be oppressed, despised, and ignored. The voices of those who have opened their hearts about ""living while Black"" cut through the darkness of ignorance about racial injustice. These deeply meaningful lessons from the lives of distinguished African American Buddhist teachers enrich our understanding of racism and the liberating effects of Buddhist practice. This collection is a major contribution and a tribute to creating an inclusive Buddhism.",,Karma Lekshe Tsomo,false,,false,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/rsr.17079

Philosophers and socio-political theorists have responded by reinvigorating longstanding debates about the requirement for reparations for colonialism, genocide, institutionalized slavery and racial subjugation (Lyons, 2017; Thompson, 2018), as well as exploring the role of reparations in transitional justice (Murphy, 2017; Pityana, 2018). These debates have also been advanced by social movements such as Black Lives Matter and Rhodes Must Fall, which have highlighted the need to reckon with historical injustices and their continued legacies of harm. These movements have brought into sharper relief the vast magnitude of systemic racism and of the ongoing harms that result from historical wrongs. Indeed, awareness is growing that these colonial and racist structures, as well as intergenerational harms, touch every aspect of contemporary social life. In recent years, the scholarly terrain surrounding reparations has expanded to include work addressing the prospect of reparations for women (Nuti, 2019), Latinx Americans (Corlett 2018), and climate refugees (Buxton, 2019). Scholars have also defended new moral bases for reparations in cases such as police shootings (Page, 2019), mass incarceration (King and Page 2018), and ecological degradation (Katz, 2018). This volume aims to center wronged individuals and groups in the sense that wronged peoples are the final arbiters of how the wrongs are to be understood, what are their precise contours, how, and to what extent repair can be made, and which particular actions will promote repair. This special issue explores a variety of issues related to reparation-making as a way to mitigate the ongoing effects of these historical wrongs. In particular, it considers a number of questions confronted by those who wish to make a compelling case for reparations. The first question addressed by this special issue is the problem of who ought to make reparations. At first, one might think simply that the perpetrators of injustice ought to pay reparations. The problem with this view, of course, is that many of these large-scale, historical injustices were committed such a long time ago that the perpetrators are now long deceased. Given this, we might instead argue that those who benefitted from these injustices (Butt, 2014) or the institutions of which the perpetrators were a part (Thompson, 2018) ought to pay reparations. Second, and related, is the matter of to whom reparations are owed. As is the case with the perpetrators, the injustices in question were committed long in the past, so that none of their victims are alive today. As a result, some argue that we owe reparations to the dead (Ridge, 2003) while others hold that the descendants of victims inherit a right to reparations for debts unpaid to their ancestors or that they are owed reparations for the benefits they would have received from their ancestors were it not for the unrectified injustice (Boxill, 2003). Finally, once we have established who owes reparations and to whom they are owed, we are faced with the issue of what constitutes reparations. Restitution, in the sense of returning victims to the status quo ante, will usually be impossible in the case of historical injustices. Instead, reparative measures typically aim at mitigating the effects of past injustices as much as possible: providing compensation to victims, their descendants, and communities. This should, however, not be exclusively understood in terms of paying material compensation as it leaves unaddressed other plausible aspects of repair, such as acknowledging the wrong through apologies and commemoration, changing institutional practices, providing education and other resources to prevent the recurrence of these wrongs. Relatedly, some have argued that backward looking reparations (focused on addressing the historical wrong) are not the most effective approach and that instead reparations should focus on making victims' lives better in the future or promoting future relations between perpetrators and victims and their communities (Táíwò, 2022). This shift in perspective has sometimes been described as a move from corrective to restorative justice. Despite these and other complications, calls for reparations for past injustices have been increasing in urgency. The aim of this special issue is to further elucidate some of the important theoretical questions surrounding issues concerned with reparation, and in turn, inform these calls for acknowledgment of, and engagement with, historical injustices committed by our societies. The special issue begins with two papers that consider the concrete reparations owed in response to the historic and ongoing injustices faced by two particular groups: indigenous peoples in North America and forced migrants. Waziyatawin argues that a reparative justice project, Makoce Ikikcupi (or Land Recovery), undertaken by the Dakota people, represents an important step forward in addressing the United States' past and ongoing policies of genocide, land theft, and ethnic cleansing of the Original People of the occupied land known as the state of Minnesota. Waziyatawin details how recovering the ancient tradition of earthlodge building, in conjunction with the returning stolen lands (what some call the #landback movement) can be an important step forward in removing, what she calls, the iron collar of the colonial state. Laura Santi Amantini's paper argues against prevalent accounts of why we owe duties to forced migrants. She holds that we need to consider the ways in which forced migration is often not only a result of the actions of the state of origin, but also of the direct actions of external states and non-state actors. When such agents acted in a way that directly and foreseeably contributed to forced displacement, where such actions include the upholding of global systems of inequality, these agents are outcome responsible and therefore owe reparations. The next two papers in the special issue then go on to explore the way in which reparations can be justified in the first place. Luke Moffett's paper begins by considering three of the most common justifications for making reparations: bringing about justice, moral recognition, and reconciliation. He argues that all three of these will inevitably fall short in practice because they cannot sufficiently account for the centrality of contestation in the reparations process. Instead, he proposes that the aim of reparations, when applied to real life cases, ought to be the striking of a balance between remedying the harm experienced by the victims and providing the perpetrators with an opportunity to rehabilitate their own moral position. Mark Reiff's paper proposes that, next to standard justifications for reparations based on the principle of equality, arguments to the same effect can also be made based on the principle of liberty. Taking the fundamental libertarian principle of self-ownership and Nozick's principles of just acquisition and transfer, Reiff argues that all of them have been clearly violated in contexts ranging from the colonial theft of indigenous land and slavery to the economic exploitation of women and workers. As a result, Reiff holds that a large class of people in society are owed reparations and defends the position that current wealth can be used as a proxy to understand who owes it and who is owed. The following three papers in this special issue then discuss the recent structural turn in the reparations literature. Susan Stark's paper distinguishes between addressing current injustices and repairing the past for its own sake. Stark argues that while it is an obligation to address unjust social structures, this is not sufficient to address past injustices. She argues that because individuals in the present are members of cross-temporal collectives and because individuals in the present might have been the wrongdoers of the past, they have moral obligations to repair past injustices beyond their obligations to address present injustices. The first step in addressing the past for its own sake, in Stark's view, is to center the perspectives of wronged individuals and groups. Hochan Kim's paper develops the important structural approach to reparations by pairing it with, what Kim calls the ""Beneficiary Pays Principle,"" or the idea that those who benefit from injustice owe reparations for that injustice even if they did not perpetrate the injustice in question. Kim develops a view that he calls, ""Radical Reparations"" which reinterprets what it means to benefit from an injustice. Kim argues that benefits are not only material (like wealth and property) but also include positions of power and privilege within a society. Finally, Jennifer Page's paper explores what the structural nature of injustice can tell us about the measures that will be most appropriate in response to them. Using the case of the Black American experience in the United States, she argues that we need to aim for reparative—rather than distributive—justice that responds to the wider socio-political system of racial domination and white supremacy that has resulted in massive inequalities, both past and present. Page considers three arguments against advocating for reparative justice measures as a response to such harms but ultimately rejects all of these worries and argues that, if we take seriously the enduring racial inequalities created by a system of white supremacy in the United States, aiming for reparative justice is paramount. The final two papers of the special issue discuss specific forms of symbolic reparations measures. Melanie Altanian's paper considers the important issue of epistemic reparation in cases of genocide, focusing specifically on the Armenian genocide of 1915–1917. Using the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) as a launching point for her paper and focusing specifically on the right to know, Altanian discusses the crucial problem of genocide denialism. Altanian shows that epistemic reparation requires not only the provision of information and the presence of public education about the atrocities in question, but more importantly requires a cessation of epistemic practices (such as genocide denialism) that distort, occlude, or obscure knowledge of the genocide. Christina Nick's paper considers whether reparations, and in particular official apologies, can be owed when the harm in question was the result of a dirty-handed action. Official apologies pose a particularly interesting puzzle in this context because a crucial part of any genuine apology is that the agent vows not to act in the same way again in future, but a dirty-handed agent cannot do this; after all, they acted in the best way they could and surely would do so again if a similar situation were to arise. Nick goes on to argue that, if we take seriously the insights from dirty hands theory, this issue can be overcome and that official apologies in such cases can play a genuine reparative function. Several of the papers in this special issue were presented at the 2020 MANCEPT Workshop ""Reparations: Past, Present, and Future"" at the University of Manchester.

demographers have shown concerns about the aging of populations in those countries and have suggested encouraging replacement migration policies to mitigate such aging effects. It is the classical liberal paradox – to claim the general need for immigration and then to reject immigrants. From a political and economic point of view, we are called to bring to the fore the relationship between labor and productivity transformations, on the one hand, and demographic crisis, on the other. In fact, the need for migrations is never generalized, but specific. Over the last decades, qualified and highly qualified migration has boomed, consolidating globally the presence of migrant labor in technological, scientific and financial sectors. We attempt to investigate migration in aging knowledge societies, as a result of complementary processes whereby immigrants are differentially included as labor force, and socially discriminated via selective immigration policies, which barely consolidates the reproduction of global social injustice.Keywords: Marxhighly qualified migrationsubstitution regimesaging societiesknowledge-based borders Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Critique of List’ in Collected Works, vol. 4 (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1975), p. 280.2 Richard J.

which is an objective measure of social interactions and relationships, loneliness is defined as a subjective experience where one perceives a discrepancy between desired and actual social relationships in terms of quality or quantity.3 Although it is common and natural to feel lonely at times, prolonged and intense periods of loneliness have been linked to adverse health outcomes.4 Older adults are more prone to loneliness and social isolation compared with other age groups.5 Reasons for this include significant life transitions and events, such as retiring from work, increased financial difficulties, loss of friends and widowhood, changes in living arrangements (eg, transitioning to residential aged care), increase in solitary living, and a decline in both health and independence.5, 6 Older people at particular risk of loneliness include those living on low incomes, living with a disability, living in rural areas or with housing stress, who are single, childless or living alone, who are vulnerable or at risk of elder abuse, and those with low levels of literacy or communication technology skills (Box).7 A growing body of evidence has highlighted the significant health burden associated with loneliness, with more recent studies also suggesting that loneliness has become an economic problem due to an increase in service use and demand for institutional care. This development requires both effective and cost-effective strategies to tackle loneliness.11, 12 A recent meta-analysis found that 28.5% of older people aged 60 years and above experience some degree of loneliness.13 Although the study did not observe that loneliness is more common in people aged over 75 years than in those aged 65–75 years, other studies have found that the old (75–84 years) and oldest old (≥ 85 years) are more affected by loneliness than the youngest old (65–74 years).1, 14 The prevalence of loneliness among institutionalised older adults is less well documented but a recent meta-analysis estimated the mean prevalence of moderate and severe loneliness in older people living in care homes at 61% and 35% respectively.15 Determining the prevalence of loneliness remains a challenge due to its subjective nature, the stigma attached to it, and measurement problems. The use of a direct, single-question measure of loneliness appears to be commonly applied in national surveys and research studies because it is simple and generates fewer missing values. On the flip side, such measures are prone to ambiguous interpretation of the term loneliness and under-reporting due to the stigma attached to loneliness, suggesting the need for a multi-item measure of loneliness.16 Further, achieving an accurate and representative sample of the study population is often comprised by online-based surveys, meaning that many older adults cannot be easily reached, which can result in skewed estimates. Loneliness and social isolation have been linked to common chronic diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, diabetes, dementia and depression.17 Loneliness and social isolation also increase the risk of premature death by 26% and 29% respectively.18 Loneliness can adversely affect health through various pathways, such as direct influences on lifestyle, health behaviours, and health care utilisation. In addition, it can lead to heightened or excessive stress responses (reduced stress-buffering) and hinder physiological repair and maintenance processes (eg, insufficient sleep).19 Although loneliness and social isolation may increase the chance of developing a chronic condition, living with a chronic condition is also associated with an increased risk of loneliness and social isolation,20 highlighting the bi-directional relationship. Further research in this area is urgently needed to truly understand the nature of this relationship and ultimately how we might be able to best address it. With the number of people living with chronic conditions on the rise, there is an urgent need for a holistic approach for chronic conditions management to address loneliness and social isolation. A recent report from the United States suggested that loneliness and social isolation among older adults alone accounts for an estimated US$6.7 billion in excess Medicare spending annually.2 In Australia, the total cost of loneliness was estimated around $2.7 billion (or $1565 for each person who becomes or remains lonely), where older adults aged 55 years or older accounted for more than a third of the costs.21 These costs are mainly associated with increases in health service use (ie, general practice and hospital visits), sick leave and lifestyle behaviour (ie, physical inactivity, regular smoking, and excessive alcohol use). There has been a growing number of studies showing that loneliness is associated with greater health service use, such as doctor visits, emergency department visits and hospital admissions.11, 22 Although older adults experiencing loneliness may exhibit a higher prevalence of chronic conditions that result in increased health service use, others have hypothesised that lonely older people are more likely to visit physicians to meet their need for interaction and interpersonal stimulation.22 In addition, loneliness has been identified as a risk factor for care home admission, suggesting that tackling loneliness among older adults may delay or even reduce the demand for institutional care.23 However, research in this area is still in its infancy and requires further investigation, addressing some conflicting results reported in the existing literature.24 Besides such cost-of-illness studies that provide a better understanding of the economic burden of a particular illness on society, to guide resources allocation decisions in health care, there is also a need for cost-effectiveness evidence, which is imperative to provide decision makers with the important information to inform investment decisions. Although some studies have found that a few interventions that aim to reduce loneliness provide value for money,12, 25 differences in the methods and contexts of studies mean that they are not comparable and cannot be used for integrated decision making. Further cost-effectiveness evidence is urgently needed, adopting a holistic priority-setting framework and consistent methodology. Given that loneliness is considered a modifiable risk factor, numerous interventions have been developed to reduce or prevent loneliness in older adults. Current loneliness interventions that have been explored among older people can be classified into six categories: social facilitation interventions, psychological therapies, health and social care provision, animal interventions, befriending interventions, and leisure/skill development.8 Some evidence suggests that the most effective interventions are group interventions, such as educational and social activity programs, that are directed at specific groups.25 Within the context of long term care facilities, strategies that are most effective include psychological therapies and leisure/skills development interventions, where laughter therapy, horticultural (gardening) therapy, and reminiscence therapy were associated with the greatest decrease in loneliness.9 Overall, interventions that seem to be most promising are those that consider adaptability to local contexts and include holistic community development approaches.8 However, evidence around effective interventions to address loneliness in older adults is still lacking and compromised by small samples and quasi-experimental designs that lack a control group. Variability in study designs and loneliness measures also limits the ability to calculate pooled effectiveness estimates to guide and develop effective policy responses. In order to address loneliness effectively, it is also important to understand the underlying risk factors of loneliness. These can be categorised into individual factors (eg, gender, race, socio-economic status, living arrangement, health problems), societal factors (eg, absence of support, lack of social networks or social opportunities), loss of relationships (eg, relocation, divorce, bereavement), and community factors (eg, no access to public spaces, geographic isolation, lack of transportation).5, 26 When designing interventions or policies, it is crucial to recognise that many of the risk factors for loneliness are interrelated and that each person is defined by a whole set of characteristics that can be related to loneliness in a different way. In view of demographic changes, where intergenerational living is declining and one-person households are on the rise, coupled with greater social and geographical mobility, loneliness in older adults is likely to remain on an upward trajectory. The loss of community resources, such as libraries and post offices, particularly in some rural areas, further exacerbates loneliness among community-dwelling older adults, requiring a stronger policy response. There is a need to move towards an integrated and holistic, person-centred view to tackle loneliness, integrating and adjusting interventions to the right person. However, current approaches focus on a single intervention for the entire population (""one-size-fits-all""), thereby ignoring the heterogeneity of loneliness, its underlying causes, and the unique requirements (such as individual coping mechanisms) and contextual factors (such as sociocultural environments) specific to individuals facing loneliness. Interventions must prioritise age, cultural, and gender appropriateness, considering the unique environmental and social determinants that contribute to loneliness across different groups. This includes being attentive to the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse communities and ensuring inclusivity for diverse groups, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults. It is also important to understand the subjective and heterogeneous nature of loneliness, emphasising the need to better understand older people's lived experiences of loneliness. Recognising that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, the provision of services and their implementation need to be tailored to the needs of the communities and consumer preferences, adopting a person-centred approach that includes the involvement of older people with lived experiences in the design of interventions. There is also a need for a holistic priority-setting framework that provides actionable insight into decisions about where to invest, into what kind of interventions, and whom to target, requiring both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence of interventions tackling loneliness.

on agriculture and rural life since 1750 made essential contributions to our field, died in May 2022, just before the conference of the European Rural History Organisation (EURHO) in Uppsala. Historians based in the United States and Canada became acquainted with Mats through his participation in the Agricultural History Society, which began in 2012 when he presented a paper at the conference in Manhattan, Kansas. From then on, he attended our conferences whenever he could, sharing his work-in-progress on a wide range of subjects. His warmth, generosity, and endless curiosity sparked wonderful conversations. At the same time, in 2012–13, Morell cofounded EURHO with his longtime collaborators across the continent. The two organizations soon developed close ties, as Mats invited North Americans to present papers and panels at EURHO conferences, which met every other year, and organized panels of Europeans to share their work at the Agricultural History Society annual meetings. In Uppsala, several panels included participants from both sides of the Atlantic addressing common themes. Mats exemplified the collegiality he facilitated among the rest of us.This international interchange has been transformative for many participants and for journals in the field. Those who study the United States and Canada were encouraged to situate their findings in relation to developments in diverse parts of Europe, illuminating debates about questions such as the position of farmers in the transition to capitalism, which had previously been considered by only a handful of scholars in North America. Those who study Europe were encouraged to comprehend the special dynamics of settler societies and consider the significance of race and gender in relation to property and power. Convergences and divergences in the causes, timing, and consequences of trends toward mechanization, increases in scale and specialization, state promotion of productivist agriculture, and the subsequent and simultaneous yet contradictory turns toward neoliberal policies and sustainable farming practices have been illuminated through international comparisons and transnational studies.Mats Morell's research, as well as his reflections on the development of our field, shed new light on the past fifty years of scholarship in agricultural and rural history. Like many who study rural societies, Mats described himself as a “country boy living in the city.” Growing up and attending school in vanishingly tiny villages and small towns in Västmanland, a rural county west of Stockholm with a mix of large farms on the plains, smallholdings in the woodlands, and scattered industrial plants, informed his understanding of the complexity of rural societies. He came to Uppsala University in 1975 and decided to study economic history. The field was then influenced by young Marxists whose sympathies lay with the Social Democratic Party, which had united the industrial working class, family farmers, and rural laborers since the 1930s. Significantly, Morell's last major research project focused on changes in the productivity of agriculture in relation to enclosures between 1750 and 1920 in both his native province and Uppland, the richer province east of Västmanland whose center is Uppsala.Even as an undergraduate, Mats was interested in social stratification as it occurred over time among the agricultural population. His PhD dissertation, completed in 1989, examined Swedish food consumption from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, linking standards of living to farming over three centuries of change. The creative combination of statistical analyses of historical data with qualitative sources and theoretically informed frameworks that is notable throughout Mats's work was visible from the beginning. Equally significant were his close friendships with a new generation of economic historians, who connected economic history with social history, politics, and policy. Many became his lifelong collaborators, not only on joint research projects but also on textbooks that presented entirely new accounts of Sweden's development from a relatively impoverished, predominantly rural society at the turn of the twentieth century to an affluent, urbanized industrial society with a robust welfare state in the postwar period.As a postdoctoral researcher and faculty member in economic history at Uppsala, Mats embarked on the broad investigation of the history of Swedish agriculture in the early modern and modern periods that informed the rest of his career. Peasant farmers, landholding, mechanization, markets, and the state were at the center of his inquiries. He became a leading member of a generation of economic and social historians who emphasized the rising proportion of propertyless rural workers, the stratification between large-scale farmers and smallholders, and the persistence of family farming within a capitalist system that controlled the purchase of inputs and the processing and sale of products. These historians highlighted the agency of farmers themselves in these developments, as they cleared new land for cultivation, shifted from a one-sided focus on grain or livestock to convertible husbandry, and reaped enough income to adopt technological innovations that increased the productivity of their labor and land. Old models of diffusion from large estates to middling farmers and from commercial centers to peripheries were overturned by empirical studies of the bottom-up processes of change in specific regions.In the mid-1990s, Mats began a long-term collaboration with the newly established program in agrarian history at the Swedish Agricultural University, located on the edge of Uppsala. This lively intellectual milieu, which was marked by international and interdisciplinary perspectives on continuities and changes from the ancient period to the present, generated the five-volume Swedish Agricultural History, which was spearheaded by Janken Myrdal. Mats Morell was a core member of this group from the start, and he wrote volume 4, Agriculture in Industrial Society, 1870–1945, which synthesized a large body of new work. These richly illustrated books, which draw on literature, artifacts, and visual sources as well as graphs, maps, and photographs to tell the stories of farming and rural communities over deep time, have been strikingly popular among ordinary Swedes, many of whom know where their ancestors lived in the countryside. The authors' concern for the rural landscape, environmental issues, and sustainable farming ensured that the series spoke to this moment on the cusp of change.Morell and Myrdal then coedited the one-volume English-language version, The Agrarian History of Sweden, which includes abridged versions of the volume by Carl-Johan Gadd, The Agricultural Revolution, 1700–1870, and the one by Maths Isacson and Iréne A. Flygare, Agriculture in Welfare Society, 1945–2000. The chapters in this eminently readable book will feel simultaneously familiar and strange to historians who have studied these periods in other places. The material culture and technologies of farming were widely shared across Europe and North America, but the ideologies and social dynamics of farmers' movements and their political alliances with liberals and social democrats are sometimes startlingly different. So are the changing contours of settlement: a momentous shift from open-field villages with vast commons and to dispersed farmsteads with contiguous fields and meadows.While the gender division of labor, land ownership, and authority in rural Sweden seems deceptively similar to that found elsewhere, the differences soon leap out. Not only was women's labor essential during haying and harvest, but on smallholdings, where the men were often absent to earn money in lumbering, transport, or construction, women often carried on the farm operations by themselves. On family farms, women took care of the cows, did the milking, and processed butter and cheese, as they did elsewhere, but in Sweden they were employed in and managed centralized butter and cheese dairies well into the interwar period. From 1845 on, daughters and sons were entitled to inherit equal shares of their parents' land, and until the early twentieth century, husbands and wives each held land inherited from their parents as separate property. Women's access to land and the recognized value of their labor made a difference in marital and intergenerational relationships, differing from the female dependence that was the norm in urban bourgeois families and, as Lena Sommestad has suggested, laying the basis for the two-breadwinner model in the Swedish welfare state.Mats not only supervised the PhD research of feminist historians investigating women and gender but also conducted a fascinating study of representations of masculinity and femininity in advertisements for milking machinery in the early twentieth century. In Sweden, men's movement into the cowshed coincided with mechanization, and the ads both assured farmers that milking machines were light enough for women to carry from stall to stall and associated men with milking through their supposed affinity with machinery. But the decisive factor in this shift in the division of labor, Morell concluded, was the marked decline in the relative number of adult women living on farms. He interpreted women's disproportionate exodus from the countryside not simply as a response to the contraction in opportunities to get started in farming but also as a rejection of unmarried women's subordinate position in rural society. While women who became joint owner-operators of family farms organized to improve farm incomes and their own conditions of life and labor, others refused to work as milkmaids and servants and instead sought jobs in towns and cities that offered them a greater degree of personal independence.Although Morell's history of Swedish agriculture places the country's economic and social development in its international context, his perspective was much more deeply informed by international collaborations with other Europeans than is apparent in his English-language publications during the 1990s and 2000s. During the early 1980s, he and a few other Swedes attended European conferences organized by economic historians and sociologists on themes such as living standards and the past and future of rural communities, and during the 1900s they presented and discussed their own and others' work at the international congresses of economic historians. These conversations bore fruit in long-term comparative work.Mats's most important, lifelong collaboration was with Ildikó Asztalos Morell, a sociologist who was studying agricultural cooperatives and family farms through the transition to and from socialism in her native Hungary for a PhD in Canada. They married in 1986, after they met at a UNESCO-sponsored workshop on ethnographic observations and interviews with members of rural cooperatives in western Hungary. “That changed the direction of my research,” Mats reflected. Ildikó and Mats continued to study the reorganization of agriculture in post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe through 1999. Relatedly, in 2004–10 Mats, Ildikó, Iréne Flygare, and other colleagues combined methods from history, sociology, and ethnography to study generational change and the transfer of resources in agriculture since 1870 in Sweden, Estonia, and Hungary.The other major collaborative project in which Morell engaged from 2006 through 2009 was a series of international workshops sponsored by the Program for the Comparative Study of Rural History in Europe (COST Action 35 PROGRESSORE), with researchers from twenty countries. The workshops culminated in a set of edited volumes featuring systematic comparisons of rural development in the Nordic countries and on the Continent. The Rural History of the North Sea Area network produced a series of these volumes, which are published by Brepols. Morell was a major contributor to two: Property Rights, Land Markets, and Economic Growth in the European Countryside and Rural Societies and Environments at Risk: Ecology, Property Rights and Social Organisation in Fragile Areas. At the same time, he published chapters in edited volumes on these themes. Property Rights in Land had a global scope, while Integrated Peasant Economy in a Comparative Perspective examined pluriactivity and the careful use of niche resources in areas whose elevation and northern locations created special conditions for agriculture. In contrast to many economic historians, Morell integrated Sweden's colonization of the north and its repeated encroachments on the land and culture of Sami people into the national story.Growing concern with climate change, food insecurity, and the long-term consequences of productivist agriculture for biodiversity and rural environments inspired Morell's next major collaborative project. This methodologically innovative research analyzed farmers' diaries to see how they coped with extreme weather, such as drought, excess rainfall, and unusual spells of heat and cold, and what enabled them to be resilient through periods of harvest failure. Biological and environmental scientists from the Swedish Agricultural University played a key role in the analysis. The group found that diversified farming and staying out of debt were equally important in enabling farms to survive crises. They also initiated comparative discussions of famines and the socioeconomic relations that resulted in or prevented high rates of death and emigration with scholars elsewhere in Europe. Of special interest to US-based rural historians is Iréne Flygare and Marja Erikson's study of the religious and economic unrest that led a group of utopians to leave Sweden and found Bishop Hill, a cooperative community on the prairie in southern Illinois.Morell's last book, Agricultural Revolution: Agricultural Production in Uppsala and Västmanland Counties, 1750–1920, has implications that extend far beyond Sweden. Methodologically, it demonstrates how the analysis of diverse materials including manuscript maps, land records, tax records, and government statistics of agriculture for judiciously selected regions and localities enables historians to ask and answer fundamental questions regarding the process of long-term change. Substantively, it offers a major reinterpretation of the agricultural revolution. Morell shows that the most significant increases in productivity resulted from practices that were introduced by farmers themselves rather than imposed through state policies or recommended by experts. Moreover, it differentiates between the initial growth that resulted from changes initiated by farmers and the later, less robust increases in productivity that depended on farmers' purchase of chemical fertilizer, concentrated feed, fossil fuels, pesticides, and herbicides from agribusiness corporations, which led to a vicious circle in which costs rose but the prices paid to farmers for their products did not. The adoption of complementary crop rotations and animal husbandry suited to local and regional conditions on diversified farms points to a way forward for the future, as it did in the past.Mats Morell left a legacy and a lesson for all of us. He never lost sight of the big questions we ask about the past: What did the agricultural revolution mean for farmers and rural society? How did the positions of women and men who lived and worked on farms change throughout this transformation? And what can we learn about the dynamics of change in the past that can guide us as we address the challenges facing the food supply and rural environment in a period of neoliberal policy amidst the global climate emergency? The lesson is one that Americans, in particular, need to put into practice as the circumstances of our work in academe become more constrained. In order to summon the wide range of skills and perspectives that enables our research and writing to make a difference, we must expand our collaboration across the obsolete borders of disciplines, nation-states, and continents.",,G.

Spanning multiple climatic zones—from cool temperate Tasmania to the tropical North—Australia is home to flora and fauna specific to diverse regions, including arid desert and rainforests, mountainous woodlands, and unique mangrove estuaries and coastal regions. Many of Australia’s endemic species—about 85%—are found nowhere else in the world, and in 2020 alone, 763 new species of flora and fauna were catalogued in Australia (Creswell et al). As a country, Australia is experiencing the full gamut of climate-related devastation, including rising land and sea temperatures, coral bleaching and loss of marine life, extreme bushfires and prolonged periods of drought, flooding, and relocation of communities. These extreme climate related events threaten human livelihoods and wellbeing in diverse ways, and disproportionately affect children. It is well documented that children around the world are experiencing anxiety, grief, anger, and despair about the damage climate change is causing to the planet, and the lack of action being taken to reverse this damage (Arnot et al.; Antronico et al.; Galway et al.; Hickman et al.; Ojala et al.). Today’s children will inherit a myriad of critical environmental, health, and socio-economic issues that will shape their future. Awareness of these impending challenges can invoke extreme distress from a very young age (Lee et al.; Halstead). Despite their feelings of powerlessness (Hickman et al.; Galway) and the disproportionate impact on their generation, children and young people are effective agents of change (Treichel; Haltstead; Trott). Climate change research is demonstrating that “children are effective communicators”, they “possess unique perceptions of risks” and “have distinctive knowledge and experiences and are capable of identifying and implementing viable, locally appropriate adaptation responses” (Treichel 27). The specific climate-related effects that children face vary based on their geographic location and socioeconomic difference. While global narratives and imagery about climate change and its impacts often utilise widely recognised phenomena such as melting sea-ice, deforestation, coral bleaching, and the great pacific garbage patch, the specific challenges faced by Australian children in their local suburbs look quite different. To explore the specific climate-related experiences and concerns of some Australian youth, creative and participatory workshops were conducted with children and young people in three geographically diverse regions of New South Wales (NSW). During the month of July 2023, 49 children and young people aged between 10 and 18 years participated in climate change workshops run by the Young and Resilient Research Centre at Western Sydney University. The workshops formed part of the research project in partnership with UNICEF Australia, who also co-facilitated some workshops. Participants were recruited from three regions of NSW, including Western Sydney (WS; 34 participants), the Upper Hunter (UH; 2 participants), and the Northern Rivers (NR; 13 participants). The purpose of the workshops was to explore children’s perceptions and experiences of climate change, as well as their aspirations for the future, which were then used to develop a child-centred indicator framework for climate change (Third et al.) During our workshops we discovered that children communicate specific climate-related challenges and fears based on the unique landscape in which they live, and these location-based issues are the subject of this article Children from Three Climate-Affected Areas Most workshop participants (86%) shared feelings of sadness, anger, and worry about climate change. These feelings reflect a state of solastalgia: a sense of loss and pain for the land that they love and call home (Albrecht). Participants expressed feeling a disproportionate “sense of responsibility/burden … to create change and solve [a] climate crisis that they did not start” (F, 15, WS). This responsibility “puts pressure on us to fix the mistakes of the older generation”, asserted one participant (F, 15, WS). And the burden of advocating for climate action, with its ongoing and cumulative impact on mental health, was recognised by another participant as increasing levels of “depression [and] anxiety about the future” (F, 18, WS). Throughout the workshops, one of the greatest fears expressed by participants was the prospect of climate change disrupting access to the natural world. Recognising the many benefits of spending time outdoors, participants expressed concern that climate change induced temperatures and events will trap them indoors, impacting on their wellbeing. They fear a future where “weather conditions will be unfit to go outside” (M, 15, WS), where “air pollution” and “overheating” (F, 15, WS) lead to adverse health effects and more time indoors. They also fear losing “access to education in times of bushfires, droughts, floods” (F, 17, WS), resulting in prolonged periods of remote learning (learning from home). As one child said, “we will be stuck inside or living underground” (M, 15, WS). In addition to losing access to natural spaces, children also fear destruction of the landscape. They fear a future where “waterways and landscapes are covered in rubbish and sewerage” (small group, 13-15, NR), where animals lose their natural “habitats due to deforestation” and become extinct (F, 15, NR). The Australian children and young people who contributed to this research demonstrate an acute awareness that connections with the land mediate connections within and between ourselves. They recognise the critical role that land plays in our construction of identity and community. For tens of thousands of years, Australian lands have been tended in interdependent relationship with Indigenous Australian communities (Malaspinas et al.)—cultures that represent a capacity for deep listening to the rhythms and needs of the land in all its diversity. Our participants fear a separation from land and urge all Australian citizens to act as stewards of our country. One group of children was eager to promote “an equal society that contributes to taking care of the society and land equally” (small group, 12-15, WS), while another emphasised that future action should involve following “First Nation’s environmental practices” (small group, 12-16, WS). The specific location-based experiences, challenges, and fears that emerged in engagement with these young people are explored below. Western Sydney Located in the geographical centre of the Sydney basin, Western Sydney is a dynamic, culturally diverse urban region. It has a rapidly growing population (About GWS) and is currently experiencing significant temperature rises related to its geographical location and urban heat island effects (Bubathi et al). Despite commencing only 30 kilometres from central Sydney, the Greater Western Sydney area experiences summer temperatures that can top Sydney’s maxima by 10°C (Bubathi et al). In early 2020, the city of Penrith in Greater Western Sydney was the hottest place on earth, hitting 48.9°C (Sydney’s Penrith). If carbon emissions are not significantly curbed, recent predictions suggest that, by 2090, Western Sydney could face up to 46 days each year of temperatures over 35°C (Melville-Rea and Verschuer). The economic impacts of rising temperatures—not to mention environmental and wellbeing impacts—will pervade society, from the individual ability to access necessary healthcare, utilities, food, and other necessities, to a whole nation’s capacity to provide for itself and engage meaningfully in the global economy (see Wood et al.; Steffen et al.; Australian Government). The Western Sydney region workshops took place in the suburb of Liverpool, a rapidly growing residential and multicultural area, with a population predicted to double by 2041 (Liverpool City Council). The ever-increasing demand for housing, coupled with rising interest rates and cost-of-living concerns, is putting considerable strain on families across the region, affecting household structures (Shaweesh). Western Sydney features a large culturally and linguistically diverse community, in which large family sizes and intergenerational living are common (Dockery et al.; Shaweesh). Many households in Western Sydney, including in the Liverpool region, are multigenerational or multi-family, reflecting a growing number of such households in the Western world (Lane and Gorman-Murray). Cultural values play an important role in shaping household makeup, but so do issues of housing affordability, rapid population growth, and migration—all of which contribute to housing density in the suburbs surrounding major Australian cities such as Sydney (Daley et al.; Shaweesh). While family structures and household compositions continue to change in response to social and cultural values and economic needs, physical dwellings and suburban structures tend to stay stagnant (Judd). This can lead to overcrowding (Dockery et al.). As Maram Shaweesh writes, “given that housing affordability is an obstacle to accessing adequate housing in Australia, larger nuclear families can end up living in housing that is too small for their needs (in terms of amenities), leading them to experience house crowding (Dockery et al.)” (140). Liverpool participants expressed significant concern about overcrowding in households and local communities. Although one child expressed concern that overpopulation in homes due to the cost-of-living crisis could affect “the upbringing of children” (F, 15, WS), most children were concerned about the impact of overcrowding on their access to essential resources. As one young person wrote, “overcrowding in cities is leading to hardships to access basic facilities such as schools, hospitals, etc.” (F, 18, WS). In addition to the housing affordability crisis in Sydney, participants also fear that “overcrowding in urban sprawls/cities” (M, 15, WS) will decrease their access to essential resources and facilities. One participant explained that “accessibility and cost of facilities would greatly affect young adults and children” because ""the costs for these facilities would go up”, making them ""less accessible for people in lower class areas” (M, 15, WS). Children in this region fear a future in which “food prices skyrocket due to food insecurity” (M, 15, WS); where families face “higher prices” and risk “losing jobs” (M, 16, WS); where the “cost of travel will increase (petrol and gas)” and “[public] transport costs will rise” (M, 16, WS) to the extent that people lose their mobility, “making it harder for them to travel” for work (M, 15, WS). Children and young people in Western Sydney were particularly sensitive to socio-economic inequality, and the disproportionate effect climate change has on vulnerable members of the community. Climate change “can impact certain communities more (for example, regional/rural, disabled, chronically ill etc.)” (F, 15, WS), one young person explained, while another observed that climate change “impacts people in lower socioeconomic conditions significantly” (F, 17, WS). Children in Western Sydney fear that climate change will worsen the economic prospects of people in their region. “Those who have grown up in a poor household will never be able to escape poverty due to the worsening of the economy [due to climate change]” (F, 15, WS). Some children also expressed concern that the rising cost of living, overcrowding, and limited access to resources will lead to increased levels of crime. There is evidence elsewhere in the world that climate-related events, such as agricultural crop devastation, can lead to famine and local and regional conflict (Akresh). Western Sydney children intuit this in their concerns. They fear that the rising “cost of living” and “food insecurity” (F, 15, WS) will lead to “increases in crime” (M, 15, WS) as well as “riots, fights for rights and action, [and a] lack of safety” (F, 15, WS). Upper Hunter Spanning a large region located 150km north of Sydney, the Hunter Valley comprises a river valley which extends 200km inland from the coast. The region boasts coastal beaches and estuaries, river wetlands, densely forested hills, and rich soils (Geary et al.). Traditionally a mining community, the Hunter Valley is Australia’s largest single source of coal and largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions (Evans). Extensive mining in the region has caused “profound changes to the landscape and long-term impacts on ecosystem and health” (Albrecht et al. 96). Residents of the Hunter frequently face air pollution levels which reportedly breach international standards (Fowler). In 2018, a mining facility in the Hunter was listed as one of the top 5 most polluting facilities in Australia (Australian Conservation Foundation). Families in the region are affected by coal dust and poor air quality due to the proximity of coal mines in the region, and many people have previously expressed distress about the ways this destruction of land threatens their identity and wellbeing (Albrecht; Albrecht et al.). Young people in all workshop locations expressed concerns about air quality and the detrimental effects of pollution on human health and the environment. But responses from the two participants in the Upper Hunter were particularly focussed on this issue, reflecting concerns about, and experiences of, coal mining impacts in their region. These young people hoped for a future where “mining has stopped near heavily populated towns” and where “coal mines [have] moved further away” (F, 12, UH). Coal mining was seen as a matter of environmental ethics. One participant expressed the desire for “a clean and better future”, in which “gasses that can and will pollute the air” are no longer used, and where “we stop cutting down trees” (F, 12, UH). Another asserted that “we need to move away from coal and gas, [and] move towards clean energy” (M, 13, UH). Research conducted by the Australian Conservation Foundation shows that air pollution tends to have a disproportionate effect on low- and middle-income households (Australian Conservation Foundation). While the Upper Hunter is currently undergoing a process of transition—from mining to renewable energy—participants were mindful that this must be a just transition that prioritises “decent work and quality jobs” (UNFCC) for the 14,000 workers employed by coal mines in the region (3 Local Solutions). Northern Rivers The Northern Rivers region of New South Wales is one of the state’s most biologically diverse regions (North Coast). Life is shaped by the lay of the land; but while the geography of the Northern Rivers—its plains and many river catchments—have historically made flooding a regular occurrence, the floods of 2022 were a “catastrophic disaster”, and were some of the worst in Australia’s written history (Royal Far West; McNaught et al.). These floods were preceded by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Summer bushfires of 2019, and by serious floods in 2017 (Royal Far West; McNaught et al.). Over one metre of rain fell in a single week during February and March 2022, and “whole roads and houses were pummelled by hundreds of landslides and boulders” (McNaught et al.). In the town of Lismore, floods rose “more than 2 m higher than the previous [2017] records” and damaged over 10, 000 homes (McNaught et al.; NSW Reconstruction Authority; Headspace). “The broader population”, McNaught et al. explain, “experienced periods of no or limited access to cash, petrol, communications, food, schools, carer services and medical assistance”. These were the sorts of scenarios in their region that young participants were exposed to. The 2022 floods had significant impacts on children's and young people’s education, physical and mental health, and safety (Royal Far West). A 2023 study highlighted the prevalence of eco-anxiety amongst the region’s flood-impacted young people (Headspace). The study found that more than half their participants felt fearful about the future, while one in five said climate change affects their daily lives. Describing the impact of the floods on the local community, one local young adult said, “I think that the general feeling in the community was one of gut-wrenching pain. Not on just a physical and mental level, but also on a spiritual level. It was our whole community—tens of thousands of people—impacted” (Zanuso in Headspace). During the 2022 floods, 331 schools in NSW were forced to temporarily close, and many students had to relocate for extended periods—as did many residents whose homes were destroyed or damaged (Royal Far West). These experiences were powerfully reflected in young people’s input at workshops, where they expressed a very real sense of the imminent threats of climate change. The workshop responses from Northern Rivers young people were “profoundly shaped” by their recent experiences of extreme weather events (Third et al. 25). Many responses were especially focussed on climate-related disruptions to education and resourcing, showing the ways in which participants value their education and the future opportunities it brings. Participants demonstrated concern about the ongoing impacts of climate disasters on their schooling: “schools won’t be useable because of the constant flooding”, one small group of 14–17-year-olds explained; “the school will have to be constantly rebuilt which would cost lots of money”. And, where the over-population of schools due to relocation of displaced students occurred, this could “lead to [a] lack of quality education and opportunities” (small group, 13–15, NR). “[Having a] bigger school affects education equality”, one student observed (15, F, NR), while another explained that in such scenarios, “schools won’t have the right materials to teach” (14, M, NR). The long-term effect of climate-related displacement is a huge concern expressed by Northern Rivers participants, many of whom are still feeling the impact of the 2022 floods in their community. “Even today in 2023, there are houses that are empty, and it plays on your mind. There were people living in those homes once, and there are no longer people there. It hits very close to home” (Zanuso in Headspace). Children and young people demonstrate serious concern about the longevity of their community. “By doing nothing about climate change”, said one group of 14–17-year-olds, “downtown Lismore will be uninhabitable due to regular flooding”. “Twenty years into the future”, another group declared, “[climate change will have] flooded Lismore out of existence” (small group, 13–15, NR). For these young people, the possibility of having to leave their homes and communities permanently because of the impacts of climate change is already a reality. Conclusion The imagery associated with climate change globally—ice caps melting, coral bleaching, the increasing threat to natural flora and fauna, and so on—can often feel distant and removed from everyday life in the suburbs. The reality is, however, that climate change poses a very real threat to our daily lives, and this threat is felt keenly by the young participants of this study. Australian children and young people face the effects of climate change every day in their local suburbs and communities. Importantly, climate change affects them differently according to the landscape in which they live. Within the same state of New South Wales, at three separate locations within a 740km distance, children express specific climate-related challenges and concerns which differ greatly according to location. In Western Sydney, children fear rising temperatures, overcrowding, and losing access to essential resources. In the Hunter Valley, children fear destruction of the natural landscape, poor air quality, and uncertainty at a time of just transition. In the Northern Rivers region, children fear the ongoing impacts of devastating floods, including the destruction of infrastructure and the relocation and loss of their community. Australian children experience climate change differently according to the landscape in which they live, but they share a sense of despair about the destruction of land and loss of wellbeing. In addition to a commitment to global and national climate action, concrete location-based action that addresses specific local challenges will be essential to bolstering resilience to future climate change events.

Australian children are uniquely situated in a vast landscape that varies drastically across locations. Spanning multiple climatic zones—from cool temperate Tasmania to the tropical North—Australia is home to flora and fauna specific to diverse regions, including arid desert and rainforests, mountainous woodlands, and unique mangrove estuaries and coastal regions. Many of Australia’s endemic species—about 85%—are found nowhere else in the world, and in 2020 alone, 763 new species of flora and fauna were catalogued in Australia (Creswell et al). As a country, Australia is experiencing the full gamut of climate-related devastation, including rising land and sea temperatures, coral bleaching and loss of marine life, extreme bushfires and prolonged periods of drought, flooding, and relocation of communities. These extreme climate related events threaten human livelihoods and wellbeing in diverse ways, and disproportionately affect children.
It is well documented that children around the world are experiencing anxiety, grief, anger, and despair about the damage climate change is causing to the planet, and the lack of action being taken to reverse this damage (Arnot et al.; Antronico et al.; Galway et al.; Hickman et al.; Ojala et al.). Today’s children will inherit a myriad of critical environmental, health, and socio-economic issues that will shape their future. Awareness of these impending challenges can invoke extreme distress from a very young age (Lee et al.; Halstead). Despite their feelings of powerlessness (Hickman et al.; Galway) and the disproportionate impact on their generation, children and young people are effective agents of change (Treichel; Haltstead; Trott). Climate change research is demonstrating that “children are effective communicators”, they “possess unique perceptions of risks” and “have distinctive knowledge and experiences and are capable of identifying and implementing viable, locally appropriate adaptation responses” (Treichel 27). The specific climate-related effects that children face vary based on their geographic location and socioeconomic difference.
While global narratives and imagery about climate change and its impacts often utilise widely recognised phenomena such as melting sea-ice, deforestation, coral bleaching, and the great pacific garbage patch, the specific challenges faced by Australian children in their local suburbs look quite different. To explore the specific climate-related experiences and concerns of some Australian youth, creative and participatory workshops were conducted with children and young people in three geographically diverse regions of New South Wales (NSW). During the month of July 2023, 49 children and young people aged between 10 and 18 years participated in climate change workshops run by the Young and Resilient Research Centre at Western Sydney University. The workshops formed part of the research project in partnership with UNICEF Australia, who also co-facilitated some workshops. Participants were recruited from three regions of NSW, including Western Sydney (WS; 34 participants), the Upper Hunter (UH; 2 participants), and the Northern Rivers (NR; 13 participants). The purpose of the workshops was to explore children’s perceptions and experiences of climate change, as well as their aspirations for the future, which were then used to develop a child-centred indicator framework for climate change (Third et al.) During our workshops we discovered that children communicate specific climate-related challenges and fears based on the unique landscape in which they live, and these location-based issues are the subject of this article
Children from Three Climate-Affected Areas 
Most workshop participants (86%) shared feelings of sadness, anger, and worry about climate change. These feelings reflect a state of solastalgia: a sense of loss and pain for the land that they love and call home (Albrecht). Participants expressed feeling a disproportionate “sense of responsibility/burden … to create change and solve [a] climate crisis that they did not start” (F, 15, WS). This responsibility “puts pressure on us to fix the mistakes of the older generation”, asserted one participant (F, 15, WS). And the burden of advocating for climate action, with its ongoing and cumulative impact on mental health, was recognised by another participant as increasing levels of “depression [and] anxiety about the future” (F, 18, WS).
Throughout the workshops, one of the greatest fears expressed by participants was the prospect of climate change disrupting access to the natural world. Recognising the many benefits of spending time outdoors, participants expressed concern that climate change induced temperatures and events will trap them indoors, impacting on their wellbeing. They fear a future where “weather conditions will be unfit to go outside” (M, 15, WS), where “air pollution” and “overheating” (F, 15, WS) lead to adverse health effects and more time indoors. They also fear losing “access to education in times of bushfires, droughts, floods” (F, 17, WS), resulting in prolonged periods of remote learning (learning from home). As one child said, “we will be stuck inside or living underground” (M, 15, WS). In addition to losing access to natural spaces, children also fear destruction of the landscape. They fear a future where “waterways and landscapes are covered in rubbish and sewerage” (small group, 13-15, NR), where animals lose their natural “habitats due to deforestation” and become extinct (F, 15, NR).
The Australian children and young people who contributed to this research demonstrate an acute awareness that connections with the land mediate connections within and between ourselves. They recognise the critical role that land plays in our construction of identity and community. For tens of thousands of years, Australian lands have been tended in interdependent relationship with Indigenous Australian communities (Malaspinas et al.)—cultures that represent a capacity for deep listening to the rhythms and needs of the land in all its diversity. Our participants fear a separation from land and urge all Australian citizens to act as stewards of our country. One group of children was eager to promote “an equal society that contributes to taking care of the society and land equally” (small group, 12-15, WS), while another emphasised that future action should involve following “First Nation’s environmental practices” (small group, 12-16, WS). The specific location-based experiences, challenges, and fears that emerged in engagement with these young people are explored below.  
Western Sydney 
Located in the geographical centre of the Sydney basin, Western Sydney is a dynamic, culturally diverse urban region. It has a rapidly growing population (About GWS) and is currently experiencing significant temperature rises related to its geographical location and urban heat island effects (Bubathi et al). Despite commencing only 30 kilometres from central Sydney, the Greater Western Sydney area experiences summer temperatures that can top Sydney’s maxima by 10°C (Bubathi et al). In early 2020, the city of Penrith in Greater Western Sydney was the hottest place on earth, hitting 48.9°C (Sydney’s Penrith). If carbon emissions are not significantly curbed, recent predictions suggest that, by 2090, Western Sydney could face up to 46 days each year of temperatures over 35°C (Melville-Rea and Verschuer). The economic impacts of rising temperatures—not to mention environmental and wellbeing impacts—will pervade society, from the individual ability to access necessary healthcare, utilities, food, and other necessities, to a whole nation’s capacity to provide for itself and engage meaningfully in the global economy (see Wood et al.; Steffen et al.; Australian Government).
The Western Sydney region workshops took place in the suburb of Liverpool, a rapidly growing residential and multicultural area, with a population predicted to double by 2041 (Liverpool City Council). The ever-increasing demand for housing, coupled with rising interest rates and cost-of-living concerns, is putting considerable strain on families across the region, affecting household structures (Shaweesh). Western Sydney features a large culturally and linguistically diverse community, in which large family sizes and intergenerational living are common (Dockery et al.; Shaweesh). Many households in Western Sydney, including in the Liverpool region, are multigenerational or multi-family, reflecting a growing number of such households in the Western world (Lane and Gorman-Murray). Cultural values play an important role in shaping household makeup, but so do issues of housing affordability, rapid population growth, and migration—all of which contribute to housing density in the suburbs surrounding major Australian cities such as Sydney (Daley et al.; Shaweesh). While family structures and household compositions continue to change in response to social and cultural values and economic needs, physical dwellings and suburban structures tend to stay stagnant (Judd). This can lead to overcrowding (Dockery et al.). As Maram Shaweesh writes, “given that housing affordability is an obstacle to accessing adequate housing in Australia, larger nuclear families can end up living in housing that is too small for their needs (in terms of amenities), leading them to experience house crowding (Dockery et al.)” (140).
Liverpool participants expressed significant concern about overcrowding in households and local communities. Although one child expressed concern that overpopulation in homes due to the cost-of-living crisis could affect “the upbringing of children” (F, 15, WS), most children were concerned about the impact of overcrowding on their access to essential resources. As one young person wrote, “overcrowding in cities is leading to hardships to access basic facilities such as schools, hospitals, etc.” (F, 18, WS). I",Ümit Kennedy; Sarah Bacaller; L.

I propose a radical solution designed to provoke reflection on the role of humans in climate change. To push the theoretical limits of what measures people are willing to accept to combat it, an extreme population control tool is proposed: allowing people to reproduce only if they make a financial commitment guaranteeing a carbon-neutral upbringing. Solving the problem of climate change in the long run by halting the procreation of human beings is controversial. In the absence of human beings and consequent climate change, other animals and plant species would benefit from an atmosphere more conducive to prolonging their existence and even improving their ability to thrive. If someone were to invent something to reverse the effects of climate change and improve animals’ lives, then human beings’ presence would be justified by the invention. Whether the propagation of the human species is beneficial to anyone or anything but human beings themselves is difficult to answer. Perhaps human beings are unfit to tackle this issue, being unable to judge it objectively. Managing Procreation: An alternative to Piecemeal Approaches Measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gases by nudging individuals and corporations may have a positive effect, but if their behavior is not climate neutral, they continue to contribute to climate change. Consequently, as long as the number of people increases, reducing greenhouse gases is at best a mitigation tool. If humans could rely solely on renewable energy, decreasing the population arguably would not be necessary. Significantly reducing the number of people appears to provide a solution to both problems: people who do not exist do not contribute to climate change, and renewable energy could meet the demand of a smaller population. One option is to let only those who produce the problem pay for its solution. One could determine the expected annual emission of greenhouse gases per person, assuming an average life expectancy, and calculate the costs to compensate them by, e.g., installing extra solar panels. Those expected costs could then be paid by the parents of each new person annually over the first eighteen years of that person’s life by dividing the total expected costs by eighteen. There are also practical difficulties. It would be difficult to determine the payment necessary. What should be done if a child has been born whose parents cannot afford to pay? In addition, child benefits could be canceled, contrary to recent incentives for child births instated in Italy,[1] where additional benefits will be made available to pay for childcare, and Hungary,[2] where women with four children or more will be exempted for life from paying income tax. A transition period could exist once the policy has been adopted, since it would be unreasonable to confront those who are already pregnant with costs they could not reasonably have expected. While the analysis is both hypothetical and theoretical, the impracticality is a noteworthy obstacle. There are several practical issues that cannot be addressed here, like the difficulty of calculating the added negative effects of each new individual and the unlikelihood that many citizens will support politicians who propose adopting policies that discourage having children. The upshot of what I have proposed is that climate change can be solved in the long run without financial costs to society as a whole, notwithstanding the transitional measures that would bring costs with them. Managing Procreation to Reduce Suffering Should this be deemed too harsh a stance, it is important to consider the basic issue of whether it is justified to introduce measures to reduce the number of people in an already overpopulated world, especially if climate change leads to additional suffering. One need not agree with Benatar, but his perspective must at least be taken seriously: It is curious that while good people go to great lengths to spare their children from suffering, few of them seem to notice that the one (and only) guaranteed way to prevent all the suffering of their children is not to bring those children into existence in the first place.[3] Benatar argues that non-existence is preferable to existence,[4] which raises the question why new people should be created at all. Those who question whether this planet will be habitable for future generations presuppose that such generations will exist. If people are not brought into existence, they may be said to be deprived of what life has to offer, but life must not be presupposed to be something positive. Whether this is the case in fact merits an inquiry of its own. A solution to the problem of climate change despite an increased population does not equate to a positive outcome since it merely means that something negative is removed. After all, solving the problem is not a means to an end, but a means to a means, the latter means being a means to a happy life, which does not automatically ensue from a solution to the problem. Benatar, as an anti-natalist, argues that procreation is morally wrong. His basic idea is that there is an asymmetry between pleasure and pain and that the pleasure that is not experienced by someone because that person does not exist is not something bad whereas the absence of pain that is not experienced – for the same reason – is something good.[5] Accordingly, “The reason why we do not lament our failure to bring somebody into existence is because absent pleasures are not bad.”[6] One may question whether such a perspective suffices to prove that coming into existence is always a harm, but the assertion that coming into existence exposes a new being to potential harm is clear. Objections A drawback of the proposed radical solution, placing the financial impediment on procreation, is that it will not solve climate change in the short run. A significant drop in the number of people (if that were achieved) may have a positive effect in the long run, but for now the behavior of the people in existence is the problem. Other climate change mitigation policies would necessarily continue. Additionally, there are important practical reasons to continue to procreate. The benefits for the elderly are paid for by the labor force. It is a problem that new generations are created as mere means to benefit older people. Perhaps more troubling, a pyramid scheme is created: by the time those people have themselves become old, a new labor force must have been brought into existence, a process that must presumably continue. If a consideration for people in developing countries to have children is that they cannot provide for themselves at an advanced age, while benefits are either lacking or insufficient, developed countries could collectively fund a pension scheme.[7] This may be low-cost if it is tailored to the living standard in the countries in question and given the life expectancy. Such a pension scheme should be predicated on the countries’ efforts in reducing the birth rate. If the labor force decreases, the economy may suffer. The focus on economic growth is arguably one of the causes of climate change, but if the number of people is reduced, the living standard does not have to be compromised, since the economy can then still grow. If fewer people began to use natural resources and nonrenewable energy at higher per capita rates, then the procreation might not be beneficial to the climate. It would need to be accompanied by regulations on use. One may also object that only wealthy people will be able to afford children. This is correct, but there is no right to have a child one cannot afford. The right to procreate does not entail the right to have as many children as one wants.[8] Yet in many countries, like the United States, it is a fundamental right that is constitutionally protected. There are numerous social, emotional, and even biological reasons why people choose to procreate. These may include the joy of having a family, the hope that children may bring in society, and the intergenerational transference of knowledge. People may have a strong desire to raise children or even a religious duty. If someone procures a sports car that is highly polluting, it would be justifiable to impose a tax in such a case (also discouraging future buyers). Many taxes and fines are imposed on corporate polluters. Procreation is significantly different but if the issue is regarded with some distance, then a climate change prevention tax could be appropriate. Some may argue that raising children is expensive already, which nonetheless does not deter people from having children. The tax I propose would be additional and specifically dedicated to carbon neutrality, but it would be difficult to predict whether it would discourage procreation. One last objection may be that for those now dedicated to sustainability for preserving the earth for the sake of future generations, there would be little or no incentive to continue any climate change mitigation efforts at all. If they sense they cannot afford to procreate, they may simply use every natural resource rather than save the earth for animals or for next generations. In a democracy, this problem does not exist if the majority can afford to procreate and agree with legislation on the basis of which such behavior is discouraged or punished. CONCLUSION Prior to their existence, there is no obligation to bequeath the earth to next generations. Such generations will only exist if they are actually created, and there is no obligation to create them. The lack of existence should not be confused with harm. Climate change provides an important reason to stem overpopulation. Ironically, fast rates of procreation may lead to the earth becoming uninhabitable for humans altogether. The radical solution that has been proposed here is an unrealistic scenario. For now, the average global birth rate is just over 18 per thousand people, but there is a need to ensure that the number of people is not greater than the planet can endure. While it is better to prevent problems than to solve them, the interest in procreation and its associated joys, usefulness, and cultural value make mass reduction in the population unlikely. Some countries have smaller average family size than others and can act as models for reducing population in a less radical way. The need to continue efforts to reduce climate change persists. Whether it would curb population growth or not, an additional financial burden applied to neutralizing each person’s offspring’s carbon footprint provides a meaningful thought exercise that could help alleviate the pressure on current climate mitigation strategies.

Introduction
The problem of climate change raises some important philosophical, existential questions. I propose a radical solution designed to provoke reflection on the role of humans in climate change. To push the theoretical limits of what measures people are willing to accept to combat it, an extreme population control tool is proposed: allowing people to reproduce only if they make a financial commitment guaranteeing a carbon-neutral upbringing.
Solving the problem of climate change in the long run by halting the procreation of human beings is controversial. In the absence of human beings and consequent climate change, other animals and plant species would benefit from an atmosphere more conducive to prolonging their existence and even improving their ability to thrive. If someone were to invent something to reverse the effects of climate change and improve animals’ lives, then human beings’ presence would be justified by the invention. Whether the propagation of the human species is beneficial to anyone or anything but human beings themselves is difficult to answer. Perhaps human beings are unfit to tackle this issue, being unable to judge it objectively.

One option is to let only those who produce the problem pay for its solution. One could determine the expected annual emission of greenhouse gases per person, assuming an average life expectancy, and calculate the costs to compensate them by, e.g., installing extra solar panels. Those expected costs could then be paid by the parents of each new person annually over the first eighteen years of that person’s life by dividing the total expected costs by eighteen.
There are also practical difficulties. It would be difficult to determine the payment necessary. What should be done if a child has been born whose parents cannot afford to pay? In addition, child benefits could be canceled, contrary to recent incentives for child births instated in Italy,[1] where additional benefits will be made available to pay for childcare, and Hungary,[2] where women with four children or more will be exempted for life from paying income tax.

the 1990s, the world has seen an incredible surge of Chinese performers in Western classical music. Unknown to most outside of Chinese musical networks, these musicians often began their training as young children, learning from parents who lost musical ambitions during the Cultural Revolution and who hoped to realise them through their only child. However, as children rapidly developed musical skills and entered conservatories, other career paths became eliminated. Drawing from anthropologist Aihwa Ong's work on 'flexible citizenship' and ethnographic fieldwork in Mainland China, Canada, and the United States, I theorise the 'strategic citizenship' of these students and their families. I do so to argue that the strong presence of Chinese instrumentalists in Western classical music has resulted from a desire, even a desperation, amongst many families to negotiate intergenerational traumas and acquire socio-economic stability in the neoliberal age. In this process, transnational Chinese musicians must also contend with issues of precarity and Orientalisms abroad.KEYWORDS: Chinese musiciansone-child policycitizenshiptransnationalismprecarityOrientalism AcknowledgementsThe author thanks Chi-ming Yang, Jim Sykes, Timothy Rommen, Lei X.

Although part of Hong Kong is technically on the mainland, it is not part of what various Chinese and East-Asian peoples call 'Mainland China', or guonei 国内. At times, 'China' is even omitted as 'the Mainland' is a clear signifier in itself. As this article is grounded in ethnography, I acknowledge the colloquial uses of 'Mainland' and employ it with the socio-political indexes it carries.3 I use 'Western art music' instead of 'Western classical music' for purposes of clarity, as the latter may be easily confused with Classical music, the stylistic period (c. 1750–1825). Art music also implies a greater creative range than classical music.4 Many Chinese musicians also pursue post-secondary music studies in Europe. This article focuses on their transpacific experiences between contemporary China and North America.5 My thinking on neoliberalism has been heavily influenced by Aihwa Ong's Neoliberalism as Exception: Mutations in Citizenship and Sovereignty (2006), Elizabeth Povinelli's Economies of Abandonment: Social Belonging and Endurance in Late Liberalism (2011), and Anna Tsing's Friction: An Ethnography of Global Connection (2004) and The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins (2015). Each of these groundbreaking texts combines socio-economic analyses with rigorous ethnography to investigate the impacts of late liberalism on human and non-human life forms.6 Mao Zedong became Chairman of the PRC in 1949 and died in 1976. My use of the 'Mao era' refers to the period between 1949 and 1978, when the PRC transitioned to the post-socialist era.7 I include the British empire here because of their settler-colonial projects in North America, which is continued by the Canadian and American governments today. My thinking on transpacific issues has been influenced by the groundbreaking work of Eiichiro Azuma (Citation2005), Iyko Day (Citation2016), Yen Le Espiritu (Citation2003), Candace Fujikane and Jonathan Okamura (Citation2008), and Shu-mei Shih (Citation2007), to name a few.8 For more on indentured labour, the Yellow Peril, and institutional exclusion, see Madeleine Hsu (Citation2015), Lisa Lowe (Citation1996), and Mae Ngai (Citation2004).9 Building off of Edward Said's seminal text, Orientalism (Citation1978), and the work of economic historians such as Kenneth Pomeranz (Citation2000), Andre Gunder Frank (Citation1998), R. Bin Wong (Citation1997), and Giovanni Arrighi (Citation2008), Yang illustrates that the foundations of Western Orientalisations of China were built upon objects of commerce during the early decades of the British empire. For more on the intellectual history of Orientalism from Said (Citation1978) to contemporary conversations, see the above as well as Raymond Schwab (Citation1984), Edward Said (Citation1985), Lisa Lowe (Citation1991, Citation2015), Homi Bhabha (Citation1994), Arif Dirlik (Citation1996), Andrew Jones and Nikhil Singh (Citation2003), Bill Mullen (Citation2004), Shu-mei Shih (Citation2007, Citation2008), Debra Johanyak and Walter S. H. Lim (Citation2010), Teemu Ruskola (Citation2013), and Anne Anlin Cheng (Citation2019).10 In addition to Mainland Chinese, South Koreans and Taiwanese significantly contribute to the demographic of East Asians in elite Western conservatories. Although various East Asians share similar experiences of Orientalisation, my study focuses on the experiences of Mainland musicians who are operating in the context of the one-child policy after the Cultural Revolution. For more on the experiences of Asians and Asian Americans in Western art music, see the work of Grace Wang (Citation2014), Mina Yang (Citation2014), and Mari Yoshihara (Citation2007). For more on the stereotype of automatons and other racialisations of Asian international students, see David Eng and Shinhee Han (Citation2019).11 Sea turtles (the animal) have geo-magnetic abilities that allow them to 'imprint on the unique magnetic signature of the beaches where they hatch' and use the North and South Poles to navigate the oceans, returning years later to the same beach in order to lay their eggs (National Geographic Citation2019). It is as if they have an internal GPS or compass to guide them through the expansive waters. In an affectionate comparison, Chinese nationals are thought to have lifelong ties to China, which is regarded as the point of return in their lives.12 For more on the Opium Wars and the transnational history of Asian indentured labour, see Lowe's seminal book, The Intimacy of Four Continents (2015), and Mae Ngai's, The Chinese Question: The Gold Rushes and Global Politics (Citation2021).13 The foreign credentials of overseas returnees often come at high costs for families who invest hundreds of thousands of Chinese yuan in order to financially support their child. Moving one's household registration status in Mainland China is not a simple task, but requires significant effort, time, finances, and social connections.14 For more on conservatories and negotiations of trauma, see Shelley Zhang (Citation2022).15 To this day, living in the Chinese countryside is undesirable since labour conditions are harsh, medical and social services are limited, education is under-funded, and job security is wanting (Chu Citation2010; Liang and Shapiro Citation1984).16 With household registration status, a newborn child obtains a shenfenzheng 身份证, or identity card, which they will need for transportation, education, employment, and most socio-political possibilities in life. Without a hukou, a person does not have legal identity in the PRC and their life is severely restricted. Put more bluntly, a person does not legally exist. For more on the realities of those who do not have legal status in the Mainland, particularly children born outside the laws of the one-child policy, see Mari Manninen's journalistic book, Secrets and Siblings: The Vanished Lives of China's One Child Policy (Citation2019), and Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang's documentary, One Child Nation (Citation2019).17 The requirements for transferring hukou between specific cities are unique and periodically modified. It is extremely difficult, at times impossible, for a rural resident to become an urban one, and for a Tier 3 or lower resident to become a Tier 1 resident (Chu Citation2010).18 The Central Conservatory accepts children as young as nine to begin their studies at the age of ten. Other conservatories also accept children, such as Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music, which has no age limits. Unlike pre-college programmes where students do not board and complete their academic studies at other schools of their choosing, conservatories such as the Central Conservatory require students to live in the city and previously provided all academic requirements. It becomes the child's primary school.19 The Shanghai Conservatory is the primary competitor of the Central Conservatory and is also extremely prestigious. Like Beijing, it is a Tier 1 city, although it is not the capital of the nation.20 Many students at the Central Conservatory and other highly competitive conservatories, such as Curtis, begin to self-identify as musicians from a young age due to their rigorous training and the cultural milieu. In some cases, they are taught and encouraged to do so.21 These positions are often associated with a danwei 单位, that is, a government unit. Although these public-sector jobs are not the highest-paid positions, they offer security, benefits, and influence in society. In the past, they were also accompanied by housing and food allocations, amongst other significant privileges.22 The euphemism, tiaolou 跳楼, meaning to jump from a building, is regularly used. Many in Mainland China believe that the CCP's two-child policy was influenced in part by the high suicide rate of teenagers whose parents would be left childless at an older age, past the years of childbearing. See Yun Zhou's work for more information about the CCP's family planning policies, such as the one-child and two-child policies (Citation2019), and Zachary Howlett's work for more information about the examination system (Citation2021).23 Juries are performance exams where a student plays different pieces while faculty members adjudicate them.24 Within the sphere of music performance, Curtis is often regarded as the top conservatory in the world for Western art music due to its unique curriculum focused on students and performance, stellar faculty, financial capabilities, location in the robust musical culture on the U.S. east coast, and alumni network.25 Aspen Music Festival and School is one of the premier summer music festivals in North America. Located in Colorado, it is one of the few to offer a classical guitar programme.26 After completing his Master's at Yale School of Music, Eli began a Doctorate of Musical Arts programme at another institution that he quit during the pandemic due to the unexpected changes.27 Like Fei, Eli's parents could not afford to visit the United States to celebrate his undergraduate or master's graduations.28 For more on this history, see Lydia Liu's The Clash of Empires: The Invention of China in Modern World Making (Citation2004) and Lisa Lowe's The Intimacies of Four Continents (2015).29 Ang's family was able to afford tuition costs since her parents have become rather successful in recent decades.30 The exchange rate is usually £1 = 9RMB (Renminbi).31 For more on migrant workers, specifically migrant musicians, see the work of Kai Tang (Citation2020).32 Today, there are more academic preparations at the school.33 Eng and Han speak here of the immigration experience of international students who become first-generation Asian Americans. I include their excellent work because of the applicability to Chinese musicians who are also international students, weighing their transnational options.34 As twentieth-century China scholar Wu Yiching notes, 'In the late 1970s, China was undeniably one of the most egalitarian countries in the world' due to the low incomes and limited resources throughout the country (Wu Citation2014: 4).35 On July 6, 2020, the administration announced a plan to deport international students who were only enrolled in online courses during the pandemic. A week later, the plan was reverted, but marked the precarity of international students and the hostility of the then-administration. For more, see Perez Jr. (Citation2020).Additional informationFundingThis work was supported by the University of Pennsylvania's Wolf Humanities Center and Center for East Asian Studies; and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant number 752-2017-0433].Notes on contributorsShelley ZhangShelley Zhang is the Assistant Professor of Ethnomusicology at Rutgers University, Mason Gross School of the Arts. Her research focuses on music practices in post-socialist China, the legacy of the Cultural Revolution, and Asian American issues in Canada and the United States. She was born in Hunan, PRC and raised on the traditional lands of the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishinaabe, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee, and the Wendat peoples in what is also known as Toronto, where she trained as a classical pianist. She received her PhD in 2022 from the University of Pennsylvania.","ABSTRACT Since the 1990s, the world has seen an incredible surge of Chinese performers in Western classical music. Unknown to most outside of Chinese musical networks, these musicians often began their training as young children, learning from parents who lost musical ambitions during the Cultural Revolution and who hoped to realise them through their only child. However, as children rapidly developed musical skills and entered conservatories, other career paths became eliminated. Drawing from anthropologist Aihwa Ong’s work on ‘flexible citizenship’ and ethnographic fieldwork in Mainland China, Canada, and the United States, I theorise the ‘strategic citizenship’ of these students and their families. I do so to argue that the strong presence of Chinese instrumentalists in Western classical music has resulted from a desire, even a desperation, amongst many families to negotiate intergenerational traumas and acquire socio-economic stability in the neoliberal age. In this process, transnational Chinese musicians must also contend with issues of precarity and Orientalisms abroad.",Shelley Zhang,false,false,false,false,

went into decline. One might argue that it was revived in the 1960s, but ironically, it had a second life to study secularization. The two major figures who did not share the same view of secular society in British sociology were Bryan Wilson (1926–2004), who published Religion in Secular Society in 1966, and David Martin (1929–2019), who spent much of his academic career attacking the secularization thesis publishing an early collection of articles on secularization in The Religious and the Secular (Martin, 1969) and The Future of Christianity (Martin, 2011) shortly before his death in 2019. For example, the legacy of Martin is found in the work of Grace Davie (1994, 1997) with the idea of ""believing without belonging"" and in Linda Woodhead and Paul Heelas in their research on spirituality replacing institutionalized religion (Woodhead with Heelas and Martin 2001). Their view of the vitality of spirituality in a secular society depends on whether religion, in any form, can survive the process of deinstitutionalization. James A. Beckford (1942–2022) was another important figure at this stage of the sociology of religion in post-war Britain. He held various positions at British universities such as Reading, Durham, and Warwick. In 1975, he founded the study group for the sociology of religion for the British Sociological Association, but he also developed a strong connection with French sociology. His first major publication was The Trumpet of Prophecy. A Sociological Analysis of Jehovah's Witnesses (Beckford, 1975). The status of the Witnesses as a religion and their place in British society was still controversial, and Beckford's publication was important in correcting many public misunderstandings about the Witnesses as a religion. Beckford was also instrumental in bringing to attention the growing importance of Islam in British life. He drew attention to the neglect of Muslims and their issues in British society, including the role of prison detention for the Muslim community (Beckford et al., 2005). Beckford was, in some respects, a reflection of the traditions of both Martin and Wilson. Returning to Martin's sociology of religion, one feature of his approach that has received less attention was the relationship he identified between religion and two revolutions, namely in America and France. Martin gave secularization theory a new and interesting direction in his analysis of the long-term impact of two revolutions in 1783 and 1789 on religious institutions. The American Revolution of 1783 separated the church and state, whereas the French Revolution of 1789 subordinated the church to the state. My general position on theories of secularization is that we must consider more than the attitudes and practices of individuals. It must also look at the structure of and struggles with power in society. For that reason, Martin's approach to the consequences of revolution was welcome. The political strategies of these societies to solve the problem of power with respect to church and state have indeed been profound and long-lasting. However, the political results have been extremely varied. In the United States, the constitutional settlement of the revolution, starting in colonial Virginia, built a wall between the church and the state to secure individual religious freedom. However, in the past decades, evangelical Christianity and Catholicism have had decisive effects on the political agenda of the state with respect, for example, to sexual identity, marriage, and reproductive rights. However, there are now six conservative Catholic members of the Supreme Court. The religious composition of the Supreme Court has raised criticism regarding the independence of their decisions, especially after the overthrow of Roe v Wade following Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health. The French Revolution provides a dramatic example of a state enforcing secularity in the public domain by making legal decisions, for example, about what is acceptable as a ""religion"" rather than a ""cult."" The French policy toward religion has in the past been described as a ""War on Sects"" (Palmer, 2011). Laicite has become the fundamental lens through which religious institutions are administered and bureaucratically controlled. The ideal of a civil religion as a foundation of public life has created a permanent tension regarding public display of religiosity, for example, the right to wear a burqa in public has been a divisive issue (Gunn, 2004). Despite their different revolutionary origins, the role of the Shari'a in both societies has been contentious, where the Shari'a is misconstrued as ""state law"" and ""arbitration tribunals"" have been misidentified as ""courts"" (Possamai, Richardson, and Turner, 2015). Martin did not include the British Isles in his studies of the long-term effects of political revolutions on culture and religion, but the British example is, in fact, important for his argument. Political revolutions in Britain in 1649, when Oliver Cromwell created a Commonwealth and executed Charles 1, and again in 1688–1689, when the monarchy was restored under the rule of William of Orange, but under the oversight of Parliament, have supported the dominance of Protestantism over culture and constitution. George 1 was the first Hanoverian King in 1714. The two revolutions have guaranteed the long-term role of the Anglican Church as the conduit of conservative values and sentiments (Scruton, 2012). These political events and their national consequences have not seriously interested sociologists of religion despite the British monarch being the head of the Church of England. The rituals surrounding the death of Queen Elizabeth and the coronation of Charles III celebrated the peculiar survival of royalty in a modern democracy. The significance of the continuing monarchy was best captured by the political theorist Tom Nairn in his The Enchanted Glass (1989), whose main argument was that Britain had become an industrial society without ever becoming a modern one. Its secularization was limited by the widespread ""fetishism of the crown."" Jose Casanova (1994) in Public Religions in the Modern World offered yet another version of the focus on religion and revolution in his publications on public religions and social change. Apart from the moral majority in the United States, his examples came from Catholic societies undergoing political change, namely Spain, Poland, and Brazil. Casanova claimed that these developments constituted a ""deprivatization"" of religion. The American example has primarily involved Protestant churches. The contemporary Protestant support for Donald Trump's version of populism continues to support Casanova's argument. However, the other examples can be regarded as post-Vatican II developments and in response to the Catholic Church's involvement in movements for autonomy and democratic governance in Poland, Spain, and Latin America. There have, in fact, been no further examples. In addition, the national and international role of the church in public life has been compromised by revelations of sexual abuse by the priesthood from the 1980s onward. Various commissions have been undertaken, such as the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse in Ireland. It was after 2018 that the Pope began to take overt action to address the problems while recognizing at the same time the depth of the crisis, for example, in Chile. The other challenge to the Christian churches concerns same-sex marriage. Can the churches suddenly change the traditional meaning and rituals around marriage? The larger crisis centers on the future development of marriage itself. How far can a liberal understanding of marriage evolve? If same-sex marriage is acceptable, why not polygamy? (Macedo, 2015). For many observers, the basic question of homosexuality has produced a crisis in the Anglican Church (Sachs, 2009). One neglected figure in these debates about secularization is the Italian philosopher Augusto Del Noce (1910–1989), who understood what he called the ""sexualization"" of modern culture as a fundamental aspect of modernization in two major publications: The Crisis of Modernity (Del Noce, 2015) and The Age of Secularization (Del Noce, 2017). The dominant ideology of the technological society is ""scientism"" or the view that the only valid knowledge is drawn from science. One consequence of scientism has been the replacement of the ""good life"" with ""well-being"" which requires the removal of all forms of ""repression."" Scientism provides the philosophical foundations for the sexual revolution in which all forms of ""bigotry"" and ""repression"" must be eliminated with the intervention of the new science of psychology (Del Noce, 2015:157–186). In this process of liberation, sex is disconnected from procreation and family life. Sex becomes an end in itself and is liberated by the widespread availability of contraception. Any criticism of these developments is rejected as repressive. Such repressed individuals need sexual counseling by scientific psychology. One consequence of these developments is the decline in the fertility rate. The total fertility rate (TFR) is the number of children born to a woman if she successfully completes her fertility around 49 years of age. A TFR of 2.1 is required to replace a population. In 1900, the Italian TFR was 4.6, but in 2020, this rate fell to 1.33 or well below replacement. This contemporary demographic change provides a dramatic confirmation of Del Noce's pessimism about the sexual revolution. Without immigration to replace its labor force, Italian society would face economic stagnation and widespread political instability. Del Noce, who had lived through the time of Italian fascism, argued that the age of scientism would usher in a new totalitarianism. Del Noce's views were often rejected as reactionary, but he replied that the new totalitarianism is a form of disintegration before becoming a form of domination. While rejecting the past, it cannot create any new values and would become ironically conservative in protecting the economic and political interests of a dominant class. What is required is not the preservation of the authority of the church but the defense of the religious dimension of human existence. The refutation of totalitarianism requires a recognition of the transcendent in human life. The originality of Del Noce's approach to modernization as secularization was to connect it to a sexual revolution as an aspect of a new totalitarianism. Whereas the contemporary debate about secularization has, in many respects, become stale, Del Noce took it into a new dimension by connecting it to sexual liberation as indicative of repressive politics. In the United States, Peter Berger (1929–2017) was originally a champion of the idea of secularization in his theoretical framework that explored the fragility of 'plausibility structures' in the modern world with Thomas Luckmann (1967). His early theoretical work had engaged with the German philosopher Arnold Gehlen, whose philosophical anthropology had inspired Berger's view of the precarious nature of social institutions, including religious structures (Turner, 2018). Berger wrote the Foreword to Gehlen's Man in an Age of Technology (1980). Gehlen's philosophical anthropology pictured humans as instinctively weak and that their survival depended not on instincts but on building institutions. Gehlen also saw modern society as in a state of post-histoire. Berger and Luckman's (1967) sociology of knowledge was completely built on these foundations. Eventually, Berger came dramatically to recant the idea of secularization as a universal component of the process of modernization in his Desecularization (Berger, 1999), especially after he became aware of the vibrancy of religion outside the West. This publication did much to bury existing theories of secularization, and indeed, criticism of the secularization thesis became ""the new master narrative itself"" (Pollack, 2014:111–122). I have, however, supported Steve Bruce's argument that the recantation was unnecessary and that Berger's work on plausibility structures remained valid (Bruce, 2011, 2018). In any case, there is little disagreement that the churches are in decline and that we are moving into a period of postinstitutional religion. Churches are compelled to adopt contemporary means of self-promotion, such as advertising themselves online, if they are going to retain their congregations. Spirituality and believing without belonging may offer valid insights into these new forms of religiosity, but they may also be seen to be perfectly compatible with a private culture of modern individualism. American sociologists have challenged this view. Stark and Bainbridge (1985), in their economic model of religion, argue that the vibrancy and dynamism of American religiosity depend precisely on the absence of a dominated established church and the openness of the religious market. One might argue that these research themes—secularization, the decline of institutionalized religion, and the erosion of the plausibility structures supporting religious faith—were the legacy of the heyday of the early sociology of religion. Durkheim had spoken of the decline of the ""old gods."" However, he concluded that religion ""seems destined to transform itself rather than to disappear"" (Durkheim, 2001:326) and ""No society can exist which does not feel the need at regular intervals to satisfy and reaffirm the collective feeling and ideas that constitute its unity and its personality"" (Durkheim, 2001:322). In the 1960s, much of the focus of American sociology was not on sociological developments in Europe and still less on the rest of the world. Durkheim's use of Australian aboriginal resources that had been collected by British colonial administrators was unique. The other major figure in the American sociological tradition in this period was Robert N. Bellah, who played a key role in this article, especially when I looked at the comparative historical sociology of religious traditions in the so-called ""Axial Age."" Bellah is central to my own approach to sociology, given my long-standing interest in Max Weber's legacy of historical and comparative sociology, as perhaps best illustrated in Weber and Islam (Turner, 1974). Bellah's sociology has, in fact, always been comparative and open to diverse cultural traditions. For example, his early research involved a study of the Apache kinship system (Bellah, 1952). Ironically, however, his most influential publication, at least in his early career, was his article on the civil religion in Daedalus (Bellah, 1967) that involved the debate about religion in the public domain in the form of ""the civil religion"" in America. Given Bellah's' lifelong interest in ""tribal cultures"" and ""nonwestern societies,"" the success of the 1967 article was something of an albatross around his neck. The article ""took on a life of its own, one that distracted attention from the substantive issues for which it was originally intended"" (Bellah and Tipton, 2006:221). However, aspects of the debate continued to appear in his later work, such as Habits of the Heart (Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swidler, and Tipton, 1985). I dwell on Bellah because his work is, in many respects, the centerpiece of this article. His later engagement with the key idea of 'transcendence' is, to my mind, a key turning point, not only in the sociology of religion but in historical sociology. Two publications coming towards the end of his life, namely Religion in Human Evolution (Bellah, 2011) and The Axial Age and its Consequences (Bellah and Joas, 2012) may have been his major—indeed magisterial—life achievements. Although much of this interest was developed towards the end of his life, his engagement with religiocultural evolution developed from his time at Harvard in seminars with Parsons and Eisenstadt in 1955. The idea of evolutionary stages was presented in Beyond Belief (Bellah, 1970). Apart from Bellah's developing interest in Japan (Bellah, 2003), the sociology of religion of the 1960s was perhaps unsurprisingly local and national. Because sociology was late to develop in Britain, much of my undergraduate sociology involved studying American sociology. Thinking back to my undergraduate sociology program at the University of Leeds in the 1960s, our set reading included Will Herberg's Protestant, Catholic, Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology in 1960 (Gleason, 2005). My reading in social theory included the daunting Structure of Social Action (Parsons, 1949). When I eventually came to prepare for my dissertation on the decline of Methodism in England—of which Martin was the external examiner—I was reading Martin's A Sociology of English Religion (Martin, 1967) and Bryan Wilson's (1959) ""An Analysis of Sect Development"" in the American Sociological Review. In retrospect, the main interest of my thesis was the division that emerged in Methodism between the local chapels and the senior ministers in the Methodist Circuit over ecumenicalism, which involved combining with the Church of England. To understand that development, I turned to Philip Selznick's (1949) TVA and the Grass Roots to understand conflicts between the grassroots and management—a study that had little to do with the sociology of religion! The thesis was submitted in 1970 as The Decline of Methodism: An analysis of religious commitment and organization. In short, much of the attention of sociology in the period 1945 until Berger's recantation in 1999 involved a national focus on religion and its decline or transformation. Talcott Parsons, starting in the 1960s, played a key role in the sociology of religion. He wrote numerous articles on the importance of Christianity in modern America throughout his academic career. He also did much to keep European sociology of religion on the academic agenda in the United States, starting with his translation of Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism in 1930 and in The Structure of Social Action in 1937, he discussed the work of European sociologists who have remained on the sociological canon. Parsons's influence was eventually eclipsed by the widespread rejection of structural functionalism. His influence in Europe was also overshadowed by the influence of Ralf Dahrendorf (1959) and John Rex (1961) on conflict theory. However, Roland Robertson was lecturing on the sociology of religion and sociological theory at Leeds during my undergraduate time at the University. Robertson defended Parsons in British sociology against the influence of neo-Marxism and conflict theory. He also promoted the study of religion but eventually focused increasingly on his globalization theory, publishing Globalization. Social Theory and Global Culture in 1992. It was initially a critique of the neglect of religion and culture in ""world systems theory."" Although his work became influential in various areas, including interdisciplinarity, Globalization faced a lot of early critical opposition (Featherstone, 2020). Although Berger's desecularization argument may have opened the windows on religious vitality outside the West, the dominant topics in the sociology of religion have had a Western or, more specifically, a national focus. This attention to European history was perhaps driven by the influence of Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. My early reading of Weber was focused on the Protestant Ethic, which, apart from anything else, included a discussion of English Methodism. Although Parson's translation of Weber in 1930 was influential, it was challenged by historians and subsequently by later translations that questioned many of his renditions of German, including specifically Herrschaft, which Parsons translated as ""leadership"" rather than ""power."" The other complaint was that Parsons artificially forced Weber into his own ""action frame of reference"" (Cohen, Hazelrigg, and Pope, 1975). Nevertheless, the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism inspired a generation of sociologists. Despite this attention to German sociology, the peculiarity of these developments in secularization theory was the absence of any great awareness of the debate about secularization in German theology, philosophy, and sociology in the period leading up to the First World War and the end of the Second World War involving Max Weber, Martin Heidegger, Karl Loewith, Hans Blumenberg, and Karl Jaspers. I was fortunate to be invited to write the preface to Karl Loewith's Max Weber and Karl Marx (1993). His article first appeared in Archiv fuer Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitk and was eventually translated into English in 1982. Loewith had been a student under Martin Heidegger and had absorbed much of Heidegger's existentialism. Loewth's argument was that, despite their differences, Marx and Weber shared what Loewith described as philosophical anthropology. Following Heidegger, much of European social theory and philosophy struggled to come to terms with Heidegger's question, ""What is man?"" in modernity. I found this existential approach congenial after studying the impact of Arnold Gehlen's anthropology on Berger. The gist of this article concerns the strange neglect of comparative sociology of religion and the dominant focus on the United States and Europe. Weber was eventually equally famous for his Religion of India (Weber, 1958) and The Religion of China (1951) when these appeared in English translation. Given the neglect of Weber's scattered commentary on Islam, My Weber and Islam (1974) was immediately successful and was positively reviewed by Ernest Gellner, who was by then famous for his research on the Atlas Mountains. Perhaps the success of my publication reflected the fact that there was little competition, and the book was critical of Weber's view that Islam was a warrior religion. I pointed out that Sufism was carried to much of Asia by Muslim traders rather than Muslim warriors. My publication was also treated sympathetically by a group of young anthropologists and historians working on Islam and development studies. Their number included people who subsequently became influential in the study of Islam and, more generally, in the anthropology of religion. They included Talal Asad, who had been a student of Evans-Pritchard and was to become the dominant anthropologist of Islam of his generation. It also included Roger Own, who became a famous historian of British Egypt. These scholars entrusted me to review the three-volume Venture of Islam by Marshall G.S. Hodgson (1974), which expanded our understanding of Islam as a global system or the Oikoumene as he called. His critical approach was also to oppose ""Arabism"" with its exclusive focus on the Arab foundations of pre-Islamic culture. Hodgson was for a time the Chair of the famous Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago, and through that extraordinary collection of intellectuals, his history of Islam included sociology, economics, and politics. I return to Karl Jaspers and the origins of the modern debate on the Axial Age in part because I view the question of the historical origins of many of the world religions and philosophies that had their origins in the period 800–400 B.C. as fundamental to what we understand as constituting ""religion."" In addressing this turning point, Bellah embraced the legacy of Jaspers and restored evolutionary theory to contemporary sociology. However, Bellah's concerns were with the heritage of the Axial Age and to what extent it can address our modern-day ""crisis of coherence"" (Boy and Torpey, 2019: 81). I will conclude this personal review of the sociology of religion over the last 50 years or more with three observations. The first is that the secularization debate is now deeply embedded in modern-day sociology, and it is difficult to imagine that the debate will disappear. However, it is equally difficult to believe that there will be major conceptual or theoretical breakthroughs that transform the whole field. There will no doubt be ample scope for empirical research on how young people engage with and express their individual religious or spiritual needs outside institutional religion, but this research will not produce any ""big picture"" of our modern crisis. My second conclusion is that in the past churches depended to a large extent on the coherence of the family to support its intergenerational survival. Christian Churches came to depend on the family for recruitment, especially if they did not have a strong missionary or evangelical tradition. My own postgraduate thesis on Methodism in the 1960s concluded that the future of Methodism depended no longer on the conversion of new members but on the socialization of its inherited population. In modern societies, we are witnessing a radical decline of the traditional family, including late marriage, no marriage, no-fault divorce, and transgender marriage. These developments will continue to depress the fertility rate of the developed world and shrink future generations of Christians. These developments not only influenced church institutions but also Christian theology, which traditionally included the idea of the Holy Family and the Sonship of Jesus. The basic Christian prayer—the Lord's Prayer—starts with ""Our Father who art in Heaven."" There is no question that major festivals such as Christmas have become commercial as much as family festivals. Bryan Wilson, who was, of course, far more conservative than David Martin, had argued that Christianity had survived in the United States at the cost of its theological content. Thus, turning to Steve Bruce's new edition of Religion in Secular Society, in America, the process of ""secularization drained the religious content, without too radically affecting the form, of religious institutions"" (Wilson, 2016:204). Finally, the inspiration of Bellah's turn to the Axial Age brought together many of the leading scholars of his generation in sociology, history, and theology. It was the extraordinary scholar Arnaldo Momigliano who defined what was axial about the age by concluding, ""We are in the age of criticism"" (Momigliano, 1975:9). The Axial Age established the idea that there is a different and better world beyond the world in which we live now. Along with the idea of transcendence, the Age invented new ""stories""—I use the word in Bellah's discourse with respect. Apocalypse was one such story. These developments in the late work of Bellah should encourage contemporary sociologists of religion to take these traditions more seriously. Weber, of course, took theology and biblical studies very seriously. It is enough to refer to his Ancient Judaism (Weber, 1967) and to recall that Weber was deeply engaged in debates about the social role of Christianity in the Evangelical-Social Congress. Alfred von Harnack (1851–1930), who was also involved in the Congress, was a relative of Weber. Harnack was a controversial figure in his own right, having published Marcion. The Gospel of the Alien God (von Harnack, 1990) which challenged many of the conventional assumptions of biblical history. He also published the highly successful Das Wesen des Christentums which was later translated as What is Christianity? He played a role in Weber's development of the ""ideal type"" and in Weber's understanding of charisma (Adair-Toteff, 2016). The debate about the Axial Age produced a wealth of important scholarship across a variety of academic disciplines. Nevertheless, the idea of an Axial Age has also produced a wealth of criticism. For example, the religious breakthroughs in the period 800–400 were historically too far apart to constitute a single age (Black, 2008). An alternative view is that human history has been shaped by many breakthroughs rather than by one single transition. There is also the problem of the absence of any attention to Africa and the Americas (Boy and Torpey, 2013; Torpey, 2017) in axial history. Bellah's account tells us very little or nothing about religious activity before the Axial Age. Bellah recognized that some form of religious activity such as rituals existed in ""aboriginal"" or ""ancient societies,"" but they—""tribal religions""—lacked the critical ingredient of a complex notion of ""transcendence."" One might legitimately conclude that while the idea of a single transformative age could not be sustained, it has generated many critical debates that have redefined and enriched our understanding of religion and religions. While the Axial Age debate concluded that this early period of human development created the age of criticism and, thus, critical attention to questions about power, kingship, and justice, my version of these religious developments is that they addressed, not just transcendence, but rather the precarious character of human existence—the body, our vulnerability, suffering, and death. These issues, which are basically existential in character, are the perennial foundations of any religious understanding of human life. These conclusions are perhaps fortuitously consistent with Karl Jaspers's own existential response to the catastrophe of the age in which he lived and brought him to reflect on the Axial Age. The idea of transcendence was a response to these existential issues, which remain with us despite secularization and the presence of medical science responses to our vulnerability and the inevitability of our death.

Laura Huenneke (VP for Public Affairs), Bill Parton (VP for Finance), Emily Stanley (Member-at-Large), Rob Jackson (VP for Science). Guest: Charles Canham, Secretary-Elect. Staff Present: Katherine McCarter (Executive Director), Cliff Duke (Director of Science), Elizabeth Biggs (Director of Finance), Sue Silver (Editor), Nadine Lymn (Director of Public Affairs), David Baldwin (Managing Editor: Publications). Teresa Mourad (Education and Diversity) joined the meeting after lunch on Tuesday. Monday 17 May 2010. 9:00 meeting is called to order. The Governing Board unanimously adopted the proposed agenda. The minutes from November 2009 were unanimously adopted. The Climate Statement (approved previously by e-mail) was ratified. II. Reports She had a wonderful time at the SEEDS retreat, was impressed with the setting, agenda, science, and students. There is a lot of mentoring of younger students by the older students and recently fledged young professionals. SEEDS folk have initiated “SNAPS,” SEEDS Network of Alumni and Professionals” to capture and focus the intense intergenerational loyalty inspired by the program. The SEEDS retreat participants also visited the REAL School, a science program for under-served re-entry students at Redwood High School in the South Bay, led by Cynthia Wilber and Rudolfo Dirzo. ESA reaction to the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Mary contacted Student Section chair Rob Salguero Gomez (at U. Pennsylvania), who contacted a SEEDS leader (and alum), graduate student (Jorgé Ramos at University of Washington). Power suggested that they help organize background information useful to ecologists and managers on the front line of the spill, and she put them in touch with colleagues in Florida and Louisiana, (Felicia Coleman and Robert Twilley, respectively, both of whom serve on ESA's Rapid Response Team for the BP Spill. Rob and Jorge seized the initiative and, with help from the Univ. of California Natural Reserve System and ESA Web master Zaw Aung, are organizing an online searchable metadata database of previous field research in coastal areas that are or may be affected by the ongoing oil spill. Rob and Jorge's leadership here has been inspiring. The Ecological Archives might be an appropriate home for this database, which should prove useful for scientists and managers dealing with the aftermath of the spill over the coming decades. Bill Mitsch, leading the Consortium for Aquatic Science Societies, invited ESA to join in their planned EcoSummit in Columbus, Ohio in 2012, which is still under discussion. An ESA media advisory went out the day after the BP oil rig accident letting the Press know about Rapid Response Team members who could be resources. There may be an opportunity for ESA members in the damage assessment process, based on experience of the Exxon Valdez experience. Maybe an article in Frontiers about legal aspects of specimens used for evidence would be appropriate. The luncheon for Rapid Response Team members at the Annual Meeting would be a good opportunity for getting feedback from RRT members about how ESA can help them when they are called upon for their expertise. There may be an opportunity to get out messages about the long-term ecological consequences of the spill, and the cost of cleaning up the accident compared to funding for renewable (or clean) energy sources. Why are we in reactionary rather than proactive mode so often with high-impact, low probability events? Things are looking stable for this year in terms of library subscriptions, and the slight decline in membership was expected. Exciting events include planning for the new journal, Ecosphere. The Development Committee met and we'll consider their report at this meeting. Cliff and Katherine met with Ford Foundation recently to explore possible funding ideas. Cliff Duke – Printed copies of the new Issues in Ecology, about carbon sequestration, should be available later today (it's already available on the ESA Web site). Four documents are available now from the Biofuels conference, and a fifth (synthesis) is in preparation. Teresa Mourad – She is looking forward to the 2011 SEEDS annual meeting in Washington state. Packard Foundation approached her about applying for a $150,000 grant from internal funding from their grants officers. She's trying to develop new contacts within Dept. of Interior (facilitated in part by a SEEDS alumna). There will be a summer institute in NC related to forest ecology that will include SEEDS students. New projects include a climate change education partnership (working with Terry Chapin), focused on pre-service students (undergraduate students training to be teachers). Another new project is to upgrade education resources that can be shared (images, tables, data, syllabi), and a data visualization tool. TNC received funding from the Toyota Foundation for their urban youth program, to create a network of environmentally-themed high schools, starting with one in New York City, and asked the ESA Education program to start working with them 1 June. Some of the teachers will attend the Annual Meeting. A green jobs fair will be one sub-project. Nadine Lymn – Katie Kline, new Communications Officer, has continued development of the EcoTone blog. Piper Corp is entering a Ph.D. program in scientific rhetoric after the Annual Meeting. Liz Biggs – we are still financially stable, in part thanks to the library subscriptions remaining flat (we had budgeted for a decline). Membership is down about 5% over the past year. Estimate is that 3,200 will register for the Annual Meeting. Sue Silver – has commissioned an editorial for the June issue about the Gulf oil spill. August issue of Frontiers will be the special issue about scientific communication about environmental controversies. The backlog is declining, due to the >84% rejection rate (70% without review). Page charges are now being charged for papers starting this year (except for commissioned papers and Special Issues that are funded). The journal is on track to be self-sustaining in another two years (10 years after starting it). The option of accepting papers that would only be published electronically was considered but rejected, in part because readers (even students) said they were less likely to read electronic-only articles (a model that American Naturalist has tried). David Baldwin – The increased rejection rate has led to a decline since the last Annual Meeting from 11 months to 6.5 months in the publication lag. Both May issues of Monographs and Ecology are out. They have hired a new person (Ellen Cotter) to help shepherd the new journal into implementation. C. Report of Vice President for Finance 1. First Quarter Financials (Parton and McCarter) The budget is in good shape at present ($348,000 in the black), and we expect the fiscal year to end with a positive balance. As of a few weeks ago our investments (with Townley Investment) were back up to where they were two years ago. D. Planetary Stewardship (Power/Chapin) Mary solicited 11 people to write about their individual projects promoting planetary stewardship at local to regional scales for the current issue of the Bulletin, and all followed through, providing the 11 boxed reports in the current article. An ongoing ESA Bulletin form is being planned and Ed Johnson is considering steps to have sections for this forum peer reviewed. The larger goal is to turn around society's relationship with the environment. How can ESA foster this? Mobilizing members through sections and section leadership is one opportunity. The Council meeting may be a venue to encourage this. There may be opportunities for the ESA staff to identify appropriate projects. III. Discussion / Action Items A. Report of the Audit Committee (Jackson/Schimel (Stanley was sick)) A few minor issues were flagged by the accounting company, and in general they were complimentary about the Society's bookkeeping practices. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves the report of the Audit Committee. B. Proposed 2010-2011 ESA Budget (Parton/McCarter/Biggs) 1. Budget and Budget Assumptions The proposed budget anticipates a balanced budget for the Fiscal Year 2010-2011. Assumptions include a projected 5% drop in membership in 2010 (there was discussion about what is behind this drop and how to reverse it) but membership is expected to remain flat in 2011, that dues will increase by 2%, library subscriptions will remain flat in 2011 (with 30% begin on-line only), and there will be a 15% drop in member subscriptions. Income and expenses for the new journal have been included, and an estimate for income from the Annual Meeting has been generated. There are no capital expenses projected, and a $50,000 commitment to the reserve fund is included. There is a 2% cost-of-living and 2% merit pool for staff. A contract for development of a Planned Giving Program is included ($2,000). Expenses for Governing Board meetings at the Annual Meeting, a President's budget, travel ($1,000) for Council of Scientific Society Presidents meeting, and one meeting each for five committees are budgeted. The Board compliments the staff for keeping the Society in such good fiscal health. 2. Proposal for the Board Strategic Initiatives funds There was discussion about the idea of providing free registration to the Annual Meeting for speakers who are invited to make presentations. Historically a few waivers are granted every year, primarily for people who would not otherwise come to the meeting. The Historical Records Committee has asked for funding for a meeting, as they start to prepare for the Centennial. The request for sending a Board member to the South American chapter meeting in Brazil next August could fall into this funding category. A follow-up in a few years of the ecological effects of the Gulf oil spill, maybe in conjunction with a 25th anniversary of the Exxon Valdez spill, could be a possibility of future use of this funding category. Maybe an Issues in Ecology in the next year or two; assumptions about how best to deal with a large oil spill are being used for management decisions, but are the lessons from previous spills being incorporated? There is some support for the idea of letting funds accumulate for a future larger expenditure. Follow-up to strategic planning discussions might be another possibility. Break for lunch. C. Fund for the Future (Parton) The Development Committee met a few weeks ago to discuss plans for the Fund. A couple of Committee members who are former Board members suggested they would like to have an option of giving unrestricted money, rather than just designated for student travel or SEEDS, and suggested adding an “Opportunity Fund” option under the Fund for the Future. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves the addition of the “Opportunity Fund” as a third option within the Fund for the Future. D. Sustainable Business Plan (Schimel) Develop open-access author-pays journals (already underway with Ecosphere); Conduct small conferences that generate revenue; Produce Webinar programs, perhaps related to conferences or public affairs training; Broaden the membership base, perhaps to NGO or other non-academic groups. The survey sent to student members did not result in any particularly good insights. Are there some sub-disciplines that the ESA has lost from its membership and journals? Who would be good point people to contact/increase those audiences? Could small conferences be targeted both for making money and for broadening our membership? Is there a way to use the idea of certification (attractive to students) to provide content for a price? What audiences have continuing education requirements? E.g., pesticide applicators, land use/zoning boards. Sue Silver's seminars on how to publish in scientific journals have been successful in Asia, and she recently presented one to a group of about 45 postdocs and graduate students at Virginia Tech. E. Emerging Issues Conference [minutes recorded by Canham as Inouye had a conflict] Two proposals received very positive reviews, and the committee felt that each, with some modification, could lead to successful conferences. There was discussion of two options (a) to request revised proposals from both groups, or (b) to select one now, but still request revisions to that proposal. Discussion favored option (b) to avoid delays. Committee and staff were encouraged by the quality of all 5 proposals. There was discussion of the format of the proposals, and whether more detail should be allowed/provided. The current format was considered suitable. The Board will ask for clarification from Blossey and Sax about several issues related to both content and organization, but pending satisfactory responses from them, supports their proposal for the next Emerging Issues Conference. The Board will ask Committee Chair Monica Turner to compose the letter to Blossey and Sax, and letters to the authors of the other proposals, based on the language in the committee report. Bronstein et al., in particular, should be encouraged to resubmit this proposal next time; that topic might also be a good symposium at an Annual Meeting. There needs to be a member of the Governing Board as a member of the organizing committee. Incoming VP for Science Deb Peters will be asked to serve in this role. F. Public Affairs Committee mid-term review (Huenneke/Lymn) Committee membership has been quite stable in recent years, and has included Laura Huenneke as Chair, Angela Bednarek, Cheryl Dybas, David Goldston, Liz Harp, and Marcia Wolfe. Efforts are under way to recruit a few new members now (e.g., Marcia Wolfe, from the consulting arena). Reviewed two ESA position statements ○ Ecological Impacts of Economic Activity (2009); which had unique challenges and time requirements ○ Ecosystem management in a Changing Climate (2010) Joint meeting with ESA Science Committee Identified newsworthy Annual Meeting abstracts Sponsored symposium (2009) ○ Global sustainability in the face of uncertainty: How to translate more effectively Ecological Knowledge to Policy Makers, Managers, and the Public Opening Plenary – selecting and facilitating speaker 2009 Sandra Postel, Director, Global Water Policy Project “Strategies to sustain Earth's freshwater ecosystems” ESA Regional Policy Award 2009 Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) “For outstanding record of informing decision-making with ecological science” ESA Policy Handbooks ○ Goal is to help ecologists identify opportunities to connect their knowledge to public issues ○ Will include chapters on: ▪ General “how-tos” & resources ▪ Opportunities to interact with the media ▪ White House and federal agencies ▪ Congress ▪ Review of major environmental legislation ▪ State level ▪ ESA member anecdotes ○ Greater cooperation and coordination with Science Office and Science Committee ○ Potential engagement of broader membership in direct action on policy (Brad Smith, ACS, guest at PAC meeting) – ACS uses social media in many ways now with its membership, e.g., getting them to contact elected representatives. ○ SEEDS students incorporating policy engagement as an element in Leadership Retreats ○ Private sector potentially crucial arena for engagement, but no point of contact yet. Public Affairs Office (Lymn) Nadine Lymn, Director Piper Corp, Science Policy Analyst Katie Kline, Communications Officer Public Affairs Office Media and policy activities often feature contributions and participation by ESA's Rapid Response Teams. The Ecologist Moves to Washington – Making Science Policy a Career An example of introduction to a podcast: Some ecologists have taken time from their academic work to share their share their expertise with policymakers; others have made a career out of it. Four years ago, Dr. Jay Gulledge left academia to join the Pew Center on Global Climate Change as the Senior Scientist and Program Manager for Science and Impacts. Here he discusses the transition and the range of options that DC offers for promoting and disseminating science. Public Affairs podcasts: Field Talk An example of a Field Talk podcast: Arctic shrubs looming large: Climate change and tundra productivity 〈http://www.esa.org/fieldtalk/?p=176〉 EcoTone - the ESA blog In April 2009, the blog received an average of 387 unique visitors and 2,491 page views per day. This April it averaged 636 visitors and 4,135 page views daily, about a 60% increase in overall traffic. Ecologists Identify Birds Struck in Hudson River Crash as Migratory Canada Geese (FIEE) Transporting Juvenile Salmon Hinders Adult Migration (EA) Ecologists Propose First Prevention for White-nose Syndrome Death in Bats (FIEE) Declining Alaskan Sea Otters Affect Bald Eagles' Diet (ECOL) Polarized Light Pollution Leads Animals Astray (FIEE) Fake cod article from FIEE is the current hot topic.

About a dozen letters on topics of importance to ecological community from science collections to water planning Action alerts to targeted members ranging from pending legislation to assisting with Gulf oil disaster assessments ESA Policy News on key environmental policy developments About a dozen letters on topics of importance to ecological community from science collections to water planning Action alerts to targeted members ranging from pending legislation to assisting with Gulf oil disaster assessments ESA Policy News on key environmental policy developments Water resources in the West (2009) Environmental Observatories (2009) with NEON, inc. Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation (2010) with AAAS and other organizations Policy and Media Training e.g., session last summer at the Annual Meeting with a panel of media experts who gave feedback to participants as they pitched their research to the panel. It was popular, and will be repeated this summer. A growing number of scientific groups are asking for help with media training. (There could be some opportunity to generate income doing this.) ESA Graduate Student Policy Awards Two to four graduate students are brought to Washington, DC each year for training and to make visits to Capitol Hill. Upcoming Activities Congressional field trip to Baltimore Ecosystem study, June 2010 (hosted by President-Elect Pickett) Policy & Media Training (e.g., for some of the ESA Board later this week) Policy handbook Possible event associated with Gulf oil disaster Rapid Response Team Continues to be a great resource for the PAO. G. Regional Policy Award (Huenneke / Lymn) Two nominees were tied for the third annual Regional Policy Award and the Board reviewed the details of both nominees: A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves the choice of Mayor Fetterman to receive the Regional Policy Award. H. Natural History Section A petition with 92 signatures (two of which were duplicates and 43 of which turned out not to be ESA members, but have been solicited by Secretary Inouye to join) was received. Four additional Board members added their names so the requisite 50 votes were received. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board agrees to send the proposal for the new Section to the Council at the Annual Meeting. I. EcoSummit 2012 The meeting is proposed for September 30 – 5 October 2012, in Columbus, Ohio. This would be the 4th EcoSummit, and ESA had a presence at the previous one in China. Bill Mitsch is Program Chair and has approached ESA to explore a possible role, which could include being on the planning committee or serving as the US host. There was discussion about the potential costs and benefits of participation. It was pointed out that 8 of the 12 members of the International Scientific Committee are editors of Elsevier journals. Mary Power, Terry Chapin and Katherine McCarter will call Mitsch with a request for some additional information about details of the proposed partnership. Alan Covich, a member of their Scientific Committee, will also be asked for an opinion. J. Report of the Awards Committee A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves the list of award nominations from the ESA Awards Committee. K. New Journal We now have a hold with the Library of Congress on the name “Ecosphere”. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves name Ecosphere for the new electronic journal. A ‘cover page’ for the journal has been designed to add to the Publications Web landing page. The mission statement has been refined: The Scope of the new journal is as broad as the science of ecology itself. The journal welcomes submissions from all sub-disciplines of ecology and interdisciplinary studies. The journal's goal is to provide a rapid-publication, online-only, open access alternative to ESA's other journals, while maintaining the rigorous standards of peer review for which ESA publications are renowned. There will be volume numbers but page numbering will start with 1 for each paper. The editor(s) will probably continue to reject some submissions without review. A call for papers will be issued at the next Annual Meeting. We hope to have an Editor-in-Chief chosen by the fall, as new submissions start to arrive (the first papers will be drawn from the existing pool of accepted papers from the other ESA journals). Don Strong will serve as Interim Editor-in-Chief, to get the journal up and running. Given that we will be encouraging all authors of papers in Ecosphere to become ESA members (through the reduced publication fee for members), we should consider the expense of mailing Frontiers to a large number of international members (anticipating that there will be many international authors submitting papers). A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: Beginning in 2011 we will provide Frontiers to international members of the ESA via free online access. Publications office is having weekly meetings about the new journal, and meetings are also set up with other people and organizations (e.g., Allen Press) that will be involved. A two-page flow chart of steps that need to be taken in this process, with target dates, has been created. New servers have been delivered, EcoTrack software is being installed now by Allen Press, and they will be ready soon. Discussions are underway with Thompson-Reuters about getting the journal indexed ASAP, with an eye toward having an impact factor generated in three years. The plan is to publish the first papers in July, with an official launch and call for papers at the Annual Meeting. The Public Affairs Office has made plans to send announcements to ESA members, issue press releases, ESA will also have a table at the ESA booth at the Annual Meeting, notify institutional subscribers, host a reception at the ESA Headquarters, etc. L. Board Vacancy A vacancy for a Member-at-Large on the Board has been created by Deb Peters' move to Vice President for Science. The Board asked the two current members who will leave the Board this year if they would be willing to extend their service another year, and both agreed. Josh Schimel was selected to fill the vacancy. M. Annual Meeting Issues A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: Lee Frelich is approved as Local Host for the 2013 Annual Meeting, and thanked for his willingness to serve. The Local Host for the Pittsburgh Annual Meeting has recommended designating the Center for Sustainable Landscapes Development Fund at the Phipps Conservatory and Botanic Garden as recipient for funding from the carbon offset project. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves the recommendation from the Pittsburg Local Hosts to designate the Center for Sustainable Landscapes Development Fund at the Phipps Conservatory and Botanic Garden as recipient for funding from the carbon offset project. After some discussion about carbon offset funding: A motion is moved, seconded, and approved with one vote against, to reallocate all of the carbon offset funding to the choice of the local hosts, rather than splitting it between the local choice and national groups. The current national groups will be reviewed in August when the issue will be revisited for the 2011 annual meeting. N. Report of the Nominations Committee (Sunny Power) Garth Redfield, Andrew Burton, Janet McFall, and Kenneth Klemow have agreed to run for the Board of Professional Certification. The remainder of the slate is currently incomplete, and will be announced soon (and future Past-Presidents are warned to start early on the task of assembling a slate of nominees!). O. South America Chapter Request for Support South America Chapter Chair, Juan Armesto, has asked ESA to support travel of two individuals to the bi-national meeting of the ecological societies of Chile and Argentina, in Buenos Aires, Argentina August 8-13, 2010. One of these would be a Board member, and the other a member of the Editorial Office or Publications Committee for a workshop about publishing. The fact that this meeting follows immediately our own Annual Meeting makes it unlikely a current Board member would be able to go. An AGU meeting is happening about the same time in Iguazu, and Rob Jackson volunteers to contact some recent ESA Board members who may be going to the AGU meeting to see if they would be willing to attend the Buenos Aires meeting as well. We will suggest using Skype as a way to have someone from the Editorial Office or Publications Committee participate in the publications workshop, and look for an appropriate (perhaps Spanish-speaking) volunteer. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves funding up to $3,000 for a recent ESA Board member attending the AGU meeting in Iguazu in August to attend the meeting of the ecological societies of Chile and Argentina. P. New Business NSF announced that around October 2010, it will require that all grant proposals include a data management plan in the form of a two-page supplementary document that will be subject to peer review. This step is part of the agency's efforts to address how best to make government-funded research accessible to the public. Bill Michener is on the Board for Dryad, “a permanent, stable, curated and updated online repository for … data”, based at NESCENT, and has sent a prospectus about Dryad to the ESA. ESA could endorse their Joint Data Archiving Policy, become a partner, encourage authors to archive their data, appoint a representative to their Board, and implement an agreement of cooperation to integrate the journal's manuscript system with Dryad's data submission process. Michener will present a proposal to the Board at the August meeting about formalizing a relationship to Dryad. Meeting is adjourned at 12:00 noon. Submitted by",,D.

The next prize will be awarded in January 2023, with BSA President emeritus John Neal Hoover serving as Chair.The 2022 Council ElectionThe Nominating Committee is proud to present the Slate for Officers and members of the Council Class of 2025. These individuals represent the best and brightest among us and demonstrate the Society’s commitment to supporting and empowering individuals from under-represented groups in making contributions, when they choose to do so, toward the Society’s efforts in building equity within the field. The Slate presented for a vote of the membership at the 2022 annual meeting is: President: Caroline Duroselle-Melish, Folger Shakespeare Library Vice President: Megan Peiser, Oakland University Secretary: John McQuillen, The Morgan Library & Museum Treasurer: G. Scott Clemons, Brown Brothers Harriman Council Class of 2025: Rebecca Romney, Type Punch Matrix; Alice Schreyer, Newberry Library; Kenneth Soehner, Watson Library, Metropolitan Museum of Art; Derrick R. Spires, Cornell University.The Nominating Committee was chaired by Heather Wolfe (Council Classes of 2017 and 2020). Devin Fitzgerald, Mark Samuels Lasner, Naomi Nelson, and Curtis Small served with her; Erin McGuirl and Barbara Shailor also served ex officio in an advisory capacity. Candidates were carefully considered after the placement of an open call for nominees in June of this year.Brief biographical statements and additional information about the nominees are available on the BSA website (https://bibsocamer.org/news/2022-slate/).Upcoming Changes to the Society Information SectionThe Society Information section is an important place for members and non-members to learn about the recent activities of the Society. In the past, it has also served as the publication of record for the Society’s activities. The publication schedule, however, requires the PBSA Editors and BSA Executive Director to finalize copy for the first issue of the year in November, before many important events—the New Scholars Program, the Annual Meeting, and the Council Election—have taken place. Editors Erickson and Werner will be working with Executive Director Erin McGuirl throughout this year to explore the potential of this space to keep readers informed. If you have ideas, Director McGuirl will be pleased to hear from you by email at [email protected]From the Publications CommitteeIn alignment with the Society’s Equity Action Plan, the Publications Committee is working on revitalizing and restructuring the Society’s monograph publication program. The BSA has taken immense pride in the publishing program since its inception in 1919, but it has slowed in the twenty-first century due in part to changes in the business of scholarly publishing. It is time to adjust our publishing model and find new ways to support the Society’s mission of fostering the study of books and other textual artifacts through publications additional to PBSA.The Committee, chaired by Nick Wilding, is investigating a number of options and opportunities modeled on those used by peer ACLS organizations and our peer bibliocentric institutions. In addition to exploring potential partnerships with university presses, the Committee is also designing a system by which monograph proposals may be submitted for consideration.In light of this important initiative, the Committee respectfully requests anyone considering submitting a monograph proposal to delay their submission until such time as a call for proposals is made. Temporarily suspending consideration of proposals will allow the Committee, made up entirely of volunteers, to focus on the task at hand.The Committee will notify members and subscribers to the Society’s newsletter when proposals are once again being accepted. Please check the website or subscribe to the newsletter for further information (https://bibsocamer.org/join-bsa/subscribe-to-our-newsletter/).The Equity Action Plan Quarterly UpdateAt its April 2021 meeting, the Council approved the Policy and Procedures Working Group’s proposed policy governing appointments to volunteer positions on the Society’s Committees and Working Groups. That policy was announced to the membership in the Society’s electronic newsletter, and a call for volunteers was issued in August 2021. The policy and further information about volunteer commitments is available at any time on the Society’s website (https://bibsocamer.org/join-bsa/how-to-volunteer/). Members of the Council were pleased that we received more responses to the call than there were vacant positions, including from members of under-represented groups and from a wide variety of professional backgrounds. As of this writing in November 2021, the appointment process is nearly complete. Full Committee and Working Group rosters will be posted on the Society’s website in January 2022 after the Annual Meeting.At its October 2021 meeting, the Council unanimously passed a revision to Article VII, Section 1, of the By-Laws, governing the Nominating Committee. The previous instantiation of this text required the President to call this Committee to order just six months before the election, which past experience has shown to severely limit both the Committee’s ability to assemble a slate of candidates in a timely manner, and the Executive Committee’s and Executive Director’s ability to facilitate a smooth leadership transition. The revision empowers the President to establish a standing Nominating Committee and defines limitations for terms of service. Anyone can consult the Society’s full by-laws at any time on the BSA website (https://bibsocamer.org/about-us/by-laws/).The Executive Director has worked closely with Committee and Working Group Chairs, the Executive Committee, and the Policy and Procedures Manual Working Group to create an orientation program for new BSA volunteers. Designed to reacquaint volunteers with the Society’s overall mission, values, and the Equity Action Plan, these sessions will also ensure that all new volunteers are familiar with the various Google Workspace tools that volunteers and staff use for BSA business. To be scheduled in February, the orientation will also introduce new volunteers to their Committee or Working Group Chairs and ongoing business.All of the changes and initiatives described above reflect the Council’s commitment to achieving a sustained increase in the diversity of BSA Council, Committees, and Working Groups.❧Society EventsThe BSA Distributed Conference: Fall 2021The following events were proposed to the Events Committee and sponsored or co-sponsored by the Society through our Distributed Conference model. Most events are recorded and posted to the Society’s YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/c/TheBibliographicalSocietyofAmerica). For information about forthcoming events please visit the BSA website (https://bibsocamer.org/programs/upcoming-events/).The following events were held in the fall of 2021:¶ “Bluestockings Bookstore: Empowering Queer and Activist Communities” was held on October 21, 2021 on Zoom. Founded in 1999, Bluestockings Bookstore has served for many years as a cultural hub, activist network, and vibrant community space on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Entirely all-volunteer run, there are over eighty volunteers, a rotating weekly schedule, and a worker’s collective at the decision-making core. Home to over three hundred events a year, Bluestockings offers poetry open-mics, letter writing to prisoners, zine-making workshops, book launches, and reading clubs. Panelists Malav Kanuga, Emiliano Lemus, and Matilda Sabal shared from their personal experiences as former and current members of the Bluestockings collective, offering an in-depth exploration of the space and its pivotal role for queer, transgender, and gender non-conforming individuals. The event was co-sponsored by CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies and the Mina Rees Library at The Graduate Center, City University of New York.¶ “Black Bestselling Books: An Interview Series on the Essence Book Project” was a series of events hosted in October and December 2021. In 1994 Essence Magazine began publishing a list of bestselling fiction and non-fiction books as a response to mounting frustrations Black writers and readers had with the American publishing industry. Beyond luminaries like Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, publishing for African American authors was nearly impossible. The EBSL was compiled from sales data shared by Black-owned bookstores in the United States and Canada. The Essence Book Project, launched in 2016, uses digital technology to reframe the utility of the EBSL to include a computationally conceptualized view of the Black literary landscape at the turn of the twenty-first century. The project, led by BSA’s inaugural Dorothy Porter Wesley Fellow, Dr. Jactina Saffold, is both a digitized version of the EBSL and a growing archive of electronic copies of each title ranked on the list.Dr. Saffold organized conversations with Dr. Kinohi Nishikawa (“Black Bestselling Books & Bibliographical Concerns: A Conversation Between Kinohi Nishikawa and Jacinta R. Saffold”), Donna Grant and Virginia DeBerry (“The Toni-Terry Problem with Black Books: A Conversation with Essence Bestsellers’ Virginia DeBerry and Donna Grant”), and Dawn Davis (“The Magic of Editing Black Bestselling Books: A Conversation with Dawn Davis and Jacinta R. Saffold”), all of which are now posted to the BSA YouTube Channel.This Black Bestselling Books series was variously co-sponsored by the Project on History of Black Writing, the Black Women’s Studies Association, the Andrew W. Mellon Society of Fellows in Critical Bibliography, and the Women and Gender Studies program at the University of New Orleans.Organized by the Working Group for International Collaboration and DevelopmentThe Working Group for International Collaboration and Development organized two virtual events in the fall of 2021 around the theme “Collecting, Knowledge, and Power: Perspectives from Latin America.” These sessions explored the hemispheric histories and contemporary dynamics of collecting and preserving Latin American library and archival materials. Featuring scholars and library and archive professionals based in Latin America and the US, the series aims to promote dialogue among scholars and practitioners while confronting ways in which power dynamics have shaped and continue to shape collecting and stewardship practices today. These events were co-sponsored by the Programa Historia del Patrimonio Documental Mexicano, Instituto de Investigaciones Bibliográficas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.¶ “Libraries, Collecting, and Area Legibility: Early Latin American Collections in the United States (1880–1945)” took place online on November 1, 2021. Ricardo Salvatore, Universidad Torcuato di Tella, delivered a talk exploring the history of North American collections of Latin American Materials. During the age of Pan-Americanism (1890–1940), US universities started to build impressive collections of “Latino-Americana.” They collected books, periodicals, government papers, and manuscripts relating to Latin America. “South America” attracted special attention because around the time of the First World War the sub-continent became, in the eyes of North American businessmen, the new land of opportunity for commerce and investment. Central to this new enterprise of accumulation of knowledge was an understanding of the past. Collectors showed enormous interest in artifacts of ancient Andean cultures, manuscripts of the early Spanish colonial period, and Spanish chronicles of the Conquest. Apparently there was little connection between the interests of North American investors (in petroleum, railroads, tramways, meat-packing, land, and financial and commercial services) and those of university archives and libraries. But, as the earlier “Latin-Americanists” acknowledged, the commercial penetration of “South America” required an understanding of the region’s culture, society, and politics, and the keys to this understanding were to be found in the colonial period. In addition, collectors of “Latino-Americana” built a strong a recurrent parallel between the commercial conquest of South America and the military and spiritual conquest carried out by the Spaniards in the early sixteenth century.¶ “Collecting and Preserving Colonial Latin America Materials Today: A Roundtable Discussion” took place online on December 9, 2021. This virtual roundtable brought together professionals from libraries and archives located in Mexico and the US to reflect on the challenges and opportunities associated with safeguarding, acquiring, and making accessible important collections of colonial Latin American materials. Together, the panelists discussed how they have navigated the structural constraints, historical legacies, and contemporary pressures that shape stewardship of Latin American printed and archival materials today. Panelists: Hortensia Calvo, The Latin American Library, Tulane University; Stella González Cicero, Apoyo al Desarrollo de Archivos y Bibliotecas de México (ADABI); José Montelongo, The John Carter Brown Library; Mercedes Salomón Salazar, Biblioteca Histórica José María Lafragua, Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla. Moderated by Corinna Zeltsman, Georgia Southern University; Alex Hidalgo, Texas Christian University.❧Calls For Proposals & MaterialsThe BSA Distributed Conference Model: Calls for ProposalsThe Event Committee issues tri-annual calls in January, April, and October that are similar to open calls for conference proposals; from time to time, the Committee may call for proposals around a specific theme. We request a general overview of the content of sessions and presenters as well as information about the budget, promotion, and general organization of the event. This allows us to compensate presenters and organizers with honoraria for their intellectual and organizational labor and to cover other necessary costs.Through our distributed conference model, BSA reduces its carbon footprint and meets you where you are by lowering barriers to participation. We have hosted bibliographical events both online and in-person at various locations throughout North America and, when possible, elsewhere in the world. Such events can include, but are not limited to, lectures, panel presentations, hands-on workshops, sessions at conferences organized by other learned societies, and receptions following events that are bibliographical in nature.In all BSA events, the material text—that is, handwritten, printed, or other textual artifacts, broadly conceived—as historical evidence, and/or the theory and practice of descriptive, historical, and/or critical bibliography, should be a central concern to participants and organizers.BSA events strive to center diverse perspectives covering wide-ranging topics as outlined in our Equity Action Plan. Events are typically free and open to all.Proposals for events taking place between March and October of 2022 are due January 4, 2022. Please visit the Events Committee page on the BSA website for more information and to submit a proposal (https://bibsocamer.org/programs/bsa-programs/).Call for Addenda and Corrigenda: A Bibliographical Description of Books and Pamphlets of American Verse Printed from 1610 through 1820Since its publication in 2012 by the Pennsylvania State University Press for the Bibliographical Society of America, readers have kindly reported several newly discovered editions and a few corrections to Roger E. Stoddard’s American Verse. At Mr. Stoddard’s request, the book’s editor, David R. Whitesell, has assumed responsibility for collecting and disseminating addenda and corrigenda. Readers are encouraged to submit reports of unrecorded editions, additions, and corrections to information published in American Verse, and reports of copies either not noted or not described by Stoddard.

No broadside (a single leaf printed on one or both sides) or leaflet (two conjugate leaves) is included… . Also omitted is ‘incidental verse,’ that is, poetry printed in the midst of or appended to a prose work. If, however, a poem is cited on the title-page of a prose work, then that work is described. All languages are included, as well as translations, and there is no limit on place of publication.”❧Fellowships, Prizes, And The New Scholars ProgramNew Scholars ProgramThe Bibliographical Society of America each year invites three scholars in the early stages of their careers to present twenty-minute papers on their current, unpublished research in the field of bibliography as members of a panel at the annual meeting of the Society, which normally takes place in New York City in late January. Per the announcement above, the 2021 meeting was held virtually, and this included New Scholars’ presentations. The New Scholars Program seeks to promote the work of scholars who are new to the field of bibliography, broadly defined to include any research that deals with the creation, production, publication, distribution, reception, transmission, and subsequent history of textual artifacts (manuscript, print, or digital). Papers presented by the BSA New Scholars are submitted to the editor of The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America (PBSA) for publication, subject to peer review, and are published in the December issue as part of the proceedings of the annual meeting.The 2022 New Scholars are Eve Houghton (Pantzer New Scholar), Christopher Adams (Malkin New Scholar), and Liza Mardoyan (BSA New Scholar).Applications to the 2023 New Scholars Program will open in late summer of 2022.
