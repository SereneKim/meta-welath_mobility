Although the specifics of what constitutes a better life vary from generation to generation, one constant is that children expect to do betteror at least to have a good chance at doing betterthan their parents. Chetty et al. show that this dream did come true for children born in the middle of the 20th century, but only for half of children born in 1984 (see the Policy Forum by Katz and Krueger) A more even distribution of economic growth, rather than more growth, would allow more children to fulfill their dreams.

Such tables relate the socio-economic position of parents to the socio-economic position of their child in adulthood. The level of association between parental and child socio-economic position is taken as a measure of mobility. Several approaches to analysis are described and illustrated by UK data in which interest focuses on comparisons of social class and income mobility tables that are derived from the same individuals. Account is taken of the use of the same individuals in the two tables. Additionally comparisons over time are considered.",
    "4": "Importance Despite substantial research, the drivers of the widening gap in life expectancy between rich and poor individuals in the United Statesknown as thelongevity gapremain unknown. The hypothesis of this study is that social mobility may play an important role in explaining the longevity gap. Objective To assess whether social mobility is associated with income-related differences in life expectancy in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional, ecological study used data from 1559 counties in the United States to assess the association of social mobility with average life expectancy at age 40 years by sex and income quartile among adult men and women over the period of January 2000 through December 2014. Bayesian generalized linear multilevel regression models were used to estimate the association, with adjustment for a range of socioeconomic, demographic, and health care system characteristics. Exposures County-level social mobility, here operationalized as the association of the income rank of individuals born during the period of January 1980 through December 1982 (based on tax record data, averaged over the period January 2010 through December 2012) with the income ranks of their parents (averaged over the period January 1996 through December 2000) using the location where the parent first claimed the child as a dependent at age 15 years to identify counties. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was life expectancy at age 40 years by sex and income quartile. Results The sample consisted of 1559 counties, which represented 93% of the US population in 2000. Each 1-SD increase in social mobilityequivalent to the difference between a low-mobility state, such as Alabama (ranked 49th on this measure) and a higher-mobility state, such as Massachusetts (ranked 23rd on this measure)was associated with a 0.38-year (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.29-0.47) and a 0.29-year (95% CrI, 0.21-0.38) increase in county-level life expectancy among men and women, respectively, in the lowest income quartile. Estimates for life expectancies among county residents in the highest income quartile were smaller in magnitude and not robust to covariate adjustment (men: 0.10-year [95% CrI, 0.02 to 0.22] increase; women: 0.08-year [95% CrI, 0.05 to 0.20] increase) Increasing social mobility in all counties to the value of the highest social mobility county was associated with decreases in the life expectancy gap between the highest and lowest income quartiles by 1.4 (95% CrI, 0.7-2.1) years for men and 1.1 (95% CrI, 0.5-1.6) years for women nationally, representing a 20% decrease. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, higher county-level social mobility was associated with smaller county-level gaps in life expectancy by income. These findings motivate further investigation of causal relationships between policies that shift social mobility and health outcomes.",

In 2005-06 n = 632 baseline study participants responded (43.0% of those traced and living in Adelaide) Multivariate regressions adjusting for sex, tooth brushing and smoking status at age 30 showed that compared to upwardly mobile persons social disadvantage was associated (p < 0.05) with more oral health impact (Coeff = 5.5) lower EQ-VAS health state (Coeff = -5.8) and worse satisfaction with life scores (Coeff = -3.5) at age 30 years, while downward mobility was also associated with lower satisfaction with life scores (Coeff = -1.3) Stable income-related socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with more oral health impact, and lower health state and life satisfaction, while being downwardly mobile was associated with lower life satisfaction at age 30 years. Persons who were upwardly mobile were similar in health outcomes to stable advantaged persons.",
    "6": "We compute rates of absolute upward income mobility for the 1960-1987 birth cohorts in eight countries in North America and Europe. Rates and trends in absolute mobility varied dramatically across countries during this period: the US and Canada saw upward mobility rates near 50% for recent cohorts, while countries like Norway and Finland saw sustained rates above 70% Decomposition analysis suggests that differences in the marginal income distributions, especially the amount of cross-cohort income inequality, were the primary driver of differing mobility rates across countries. We also demonstrate that absolute mobility rates can be accurately estimated without linked parent-child data.",
    "7": "Concerns about rising income inequality are based on comparing income distributions over time. It is important to remember that such distributions are snapshots of a single year, and that the same households do not necessarily appear year after year in the same quintile of the distribution. Paying attention to mobility, as well as inequality, gives us a richer picture of the income possibilities for households over time. We document changes in a measure of income mobility over the past 40 years, a period in which income inequality has increased. We find a modest level of movement through the distribution, particularly across generations. Nevertheless, the income quintile of one's parents still has a sizeable effect on how just how high one is likely to rise or how low one may fall.",
    "8": "Just like economists, voters have conflicting views about redistributive taxation because they estimate its incentive costs differently. We model rational agents as trying to learn from their dynastic income mobility experience the relative importance of effort and predetermined factors in the generation of income inequality and therefore the magnitude of these incentive costs. In the long run, left-wing dynasties believing less in individual effort and voting for more redistribution coexist with right-wing dynasties. This allows us to explain why individual mobility experience and not only current income matters for political attiitudes and how persistent differences in perceptions about social mobility can generate persistent differences in redistribution across countries.",

Approximately twothirds of 3034yearolds have higher real incomes than their parents did at the same age, and this has been stable for 25 years. This is a high level of mobility among countries where estimates are available. Nevertheless, mobility has declined. Over 80 per cent of baby boomers had higher incomes than their parents. Some twothirds of this decline is due to lower income growth. The remainder is due to rising inequality. The mobility estimate is higher (78 per cent) when income is adjusted (equivalised) for family size.",

The 1979 cohort as well as the 1997 cohort of the NLSY were studied in order to provide insight into how the relationship in question has changed over time. I hypothesize that as standard of living as a youth increases, so too will income as an adult.

    "14": "We analyse intergenerational persistence in income and education in Chileand Peru for birth cohorts from the early 1950s to 1990. Both countrieshave seen a structural expansion of education over this period anddecreasing income inequality in recent decades. We impute non-observedparental income from repeated cross-sections and estimate persistence inthe range of 0.63 to 0.67 in Peru and 0.66 to 0.76 in Chile for householdheads of the birth cohorts 19771990. The analysis of educational mobilitycovers household heads of birth cohorts from 1953 to 1990 and relies onretrospective information. We observe an increase in absolute mobility foryounger generations, which we relate to the structural expansion ofeducation that created room at the top. In relative terms, mobility patternsremain more stable, and parental education is still a strong predictor forown educational achievement. The relationship is non-linear in bothcountries: persistence among very low and highly educated groups is strong,while individuals with parents of average education levels are more mobile. Upward mobility is stronger in Peru than in Chile: the chances to movefrom no formal education to higher education across one generation are 46per cent, the average in Peru, compared to 20 per cent in Chile. Thechances of persisting in the top across generations are also slightly higher inPeru with a factor of 3 times the average compared to 2.76 in Chile.",
    "15": "We develop methods and employ similar sample restrictions to analyze differences in intergenerational earnings mobility across the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We examine earnings mobility among pairs of fathers and sons as well as fathers and daughters using both mobility matrices and regression and correlation coefficients. Our results suggest that all countries exhibit substantial earnings persistence across generations, but with statistically significant differences across countries. Mobility is lower in the U.S. than in the U.K. where it is lower again compared to the Nordic countries. Persistence is greatest in the tails of the distributions and tends to be particularly high in the upper tails: though in the U.S. this is reversed with a particularly high likelihood that sons of the poorest fathers will remain in the lowest earnings quintile. This is a challenge to the popular notion of \"American exceptionalism.\" The U.S. also differs from the Nordic countries in its very low likelihood that sons of the highest earners will show downward \"long-distance\" mobility into the lowest earnings quintile. In this, the U.K. is more similar to the U.S.",

We find positive correlations between measures of innovation and top income inequality. We also show that the correlations between innovation and broad measures of inequality are not significant. Next, using instrumental variable analysis, we argue that these correlations at least partly reflect a causality from innovation to top income shares. Finally, we show that innovation, particularly by new entrants, is positively associated with social mobility, but less so in local areas with more intense lobbying activities.",
    "17": "We conduct the first dedicated study of absolute income mobility in Australia, for 1950-2019. About two-thirds of 30-34 year-olds have higher real incomes than their parents did at the same age, and this has been stable for 25 years. This is among the highest levels of absolute mobility in the world. Nevertheless, mobility was considerably higher for baby-boomers (over 80% had higher incomes than their parents) About two-thirds of this decline in mobility is due to lower income growth. The remainder is due to rising inequality. The mobility estimate is higher (78%) when income is adjusted (equivalised) for family size.",
    "18": "Emily Beller and Michael Hout examine trends in U.S. social mobility, especially as it relates to the degree to which a person's income or occupation depends on his or her parents' background and to the independent contribution of economic growth. They also compare U.S. social mobility with that in other countries. They conclude that slower economic growth since 1975 and the concentration of that growth among the wealthy have slowed the pace of U.S. social mobility. In measuring mobility, economists tend to look at income and sociologists, occupation. The consensus among those measuring occupational mobility is that the average correlation between the occupations of fathers and sons today ranges from 0.30 to 0.40, meaning that most variation in the ranking of occupations is independent of social origins. Those measuring income mobility tend to agree that the elasticity between fathers' and sons' earnings in the United States today is about 0.4, meaning that 40 percent of the difference in incomes between families in the parents' generation also shows up in differences in incomes in the sons' generation. Beller and Hout show that occupational mobility increased during the 1970s, compared with the 1940s-1960s, but there is some evidence to suggest that by the 1980s and 1990s it had declined to past levels. Existing data on income mobility show no clear trends over time, but increases in economic inequality during the 1980s made mobility more consequential by making economic differences between families persist for a longer time. In international comparisons, the United States occupies a middle ground in occupational mobility but ranks lower in income mobility. Researchers have used the variation in mobility to study whether aspects of a country's policy regime, such as the educational or social welfare systems, might be driving these results. There is as yet, however, no scholarly consensus about the sources of cross-national differences in mobility.",
    "19": "Social capital-the strength of an individual's social network and community-has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes ranging from education to health1-8. However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers9, we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by ZIP (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status (SES); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their associations with economic mobility across areas. The share of high-SES friends among individuals with low SES-which we term economic connectedness-is among the strongest predictors of upward income mobility identified to date10,11. Other social capital measures are not strongly associated with economic mobility. If children with low-SES parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-SES parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20% on average. Differences in economic connectedness can explain well-known relationships between upward income mobility and racial segregation, poverty rates, and inequality12-14. To support further research and policy interventions, we publicly release privacy-protected statistics on social capital by ZIP code at",
    "20": "The premise of this paper is twofold. First, peoples aspirations for their future wellbeing (or that of their children) aect their incentives to invest. Second, the experiences of others help shape ones aspirations. This paper marries a model of aspirations-based choice with a simple theory of aspirations formation to study the relationship between aspirations and the distribution of income. Through its impact on investments, aspirations aect economic mobility and the income distribution, which in turn shape aspirations. Thus aspirations, income, and the distribution of income evolve jointly, and in many situations in a self-reinforcing way. We study the consequences of this model for income distribution as well as for growth rates over dierent quantiles of the distribution. We show that extreme equality is unstable. Moreover, when the same aspirations are shared in a society, polarization arises. The theory we propose captures both the complacency stemming from low aspirations and the frustration resulting from aspirations that are too high. As a result, for commonly held aspirations, growth rates have an inverted U-shape along the income distribution.",
    "21": "A major finding in comparative mobility research is the high similarity across countries and the lack of association between mobility and other national attributes, with one exception: higher inequality seems to be associated with lower mobility. Evidence for the mobility-inequality link is, however, inconclusive, largely because most mobility studies have been conducted in advanced countries with relatively similar levels of inequality. This article introduces Chile to the comparative project. As the 10th most unequal country in the world, Chile is an adjudicative case. If high inequality results in lower mobility, Chile should be significantly more rigid than its industrialized peers. This hypothesis is disproved by the analysis. Despite vast economic inequality, Chile is as fluid, if not more so, than the much more equal industrialized nations. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a decline in mobility as the result of the increase in inequality during the market-oriented transformation of the country in the 1970s and 1980s. Study of the specific mobility flows in Chile indicates a significant barrier to long-range downward mobility from the elite (signaling high elite closure) but very low barriers across nonelite classes. This particular mobility regime is explained by the pattern, not the level, of Chilean inequality-high concentration in the top income decile, but significantly less inequality across the rest of the class structure. The high Chilean mobility is, however, largely inconsequential, because it takes place among classes that share similar positions in the social hierarchy of resources and rewards. The article concludes by redefining the link between inequality and mobility.",
    "22": "This paper examines the sources of differences in social mobility between the U.S. and Denmark. Measured by income mobility, Denmark is a more mobile society, but not when measured by educational mobility. There are pronounced nonlinearities in income and educational mobility in both countries. Greater Danish income mobility is largely a consequence of redistributional tax, transfer, and wage compression policies. While Danish social policies for children produce more favorable cognitive test scores for disadvantaged children, these do not translate into more favorable educational outcomes, partly because of disincentives to acquire education arising from the redistributional policies that increase income mobility.",
    "23": "We exploit a volcanic experiment to study the costs and benefits of geographic mobility. In our experiment, a third of the houses in a town were covered by lava. People living in these houses were much more likely to move away permanently. For the dependents in a household (children) our estimates suggest that being induced to move by the lava shock dramatically raised lifetime earnings and education. While large, these estimates come with a substantial amount of statistical uncertainty. The benefits of moving were very unequally distributed across generations: the household heads (parents) were made slightly worse off by the shock. These results suggest large barriers to moving for the children, which imply that labour does not flow to locations where it earns the highest returns. The large gains from moving for the young are surprising in light of the fact that the town affected by our volcanic experiment was (and is) a relatively high income town. We interpret our findings as evidence of the importance of comparative advantage: the gains to moving may be very large for those badly matched to the location they happened to be born in, even if differences in average income are small.",
    "24": "This paper presents a framework for the evaluation and measurement of \"reversal\" and \"origin independence\" as separate aspects of economic mobility. We show that evaluation depends on aversion to multi-period inequality, aversion to inter-temporal fluctuations, and aversion to future risk. We construct \"extended Atkinson indices\" that allow us to quantify the relative impact of reversal and origin independence on welfare. We apply our approach to the comparison of income mobility in Germany and in the U.S. When aversion to inequality is the only consideration, the U.S. gains more from mobility than Germany. This reflects similar gains from reversal in the two countries but greater gains in the U.S. from origin independence. The introduction of aversion to intertemporal fluctuations and aversion to future risk makes the impact of mobility in the two countries more similar.",
    "25": "Objectives. We estimate the extent to which upward socioeconomic mobility limits the probability that Black and White women who spent their childhoods in or near poverty will give birth to a low-birthweight baby. Methods. Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the 1970 US Census were used to complete a series of logistic regression models. We restricted multivariate analyses to female survey respondents who, at 14 years of age, were living in households in which the income-to-needs ratio did not exceed 200% of poverty. Results. For White women, the probability of giving birth to a low-birthweight baby decreases by 48% for every 1 unit increase in the natural logarithm of adult family income, once the effects of all other covariates are taken into account. For Black women, the relation between adult family income and the probability of low birthweight is also negative; however, this association fails to reach statistical significance. Conclusions. Upward socioeconomic mobility contributes to improved birth outcomes among infants born to White women who were poor as children, but the same does not hold true for their Black counterparts.",
    "26": "The acceptance of income differences varies across countries. This article suggests belief in three narratives of modernity to account for this: the tunnel effect, related to perceptions of generational mobility; the procedural justice effect, related to the perceived fairness in the process of getting ahead; and the middle-class effect, related to perceptions of the social structure of society. The importance of the suggested narratives is tested by means of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2009 module, which includes 38 countries. The finding is that belief in the three narratives can account for a considerable part of the cross-national variation. Beliefs in procedural justice and the existence of a middle-class society clearly go together with high acceptance of current income differences, while the tunnel effect is more complex. In general, belief in generational mobility goes together with acceptance of current income differences. But personal experience of such upward social mobility actually lowers acceptance of current income differences, especially if overall generational mobility in society is believed to be backward. The framework explains most country-cases, which points to the existence of general patterns. But the models also indicate that the Philippines, and to a lesser extent the US and France, are special cases.",
    "27": "Only a few studies have tried to estimate the trend in the elasticity of children's economic status with respect to parents' economic status, and these studies produce conflicting results. In an attempt to reconcile these findings, we use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to estimate the trend in the elasticity of son's income with respect to parental income. Our evidence suggests a nonlinear trend in which the elasticity increased for sons born between 1949 and 1953, and then declined for sons born after that. Thus depending on the time periods one compares, the trend could be upward, downward, or flat. This and other factors help explain the different estimates for the trend in mobility.",
    "28": "This article demonstrates how class origin shapes earnings in higher professional and managerial employment. Taking advantage of newly released data in Britains Labour Force Survey, we examine the relative openness of different high-status occupations and the earnings of the upwardly mobile within them. In terms of access, we find a distinction between traditional professions, such as law, medicine, and finance, which are dominated by the children of higher managers and professionals, and more technical occupations, such as engineering and IT, that recruit more widely. Moreover, even when people who are from working-class backgrounds are successful in entering high-status occupations, they earn 17 percent less, on average, than individuals from privileged backgrounds. This class-origin pay gap translates to up to 7,350 ($11,000) lower annual earnings. This difference is partly explained by the upwardly mobile being employed in smaller firms and working outside London, but it remains substantial even net of a variety of important predictors of earnings. These findings underline the value of investigating differences in mobility rates between individual occupations as well as illustrating how, beyond entry, the mobile population often faces an earnings class ceiling within high-status occupations.",
    "29": "This article studies how exclusive social groups shape upward mobility and whether interactions between low- and high-status peers can integrate the top rungs of the economic and social ladders. Our setting is Harvard University in the 1920s and 1930s, where new groups of students arriving on campus encountered a social system centered on exclusive old boys clubs. Combining archival and census records, we first show that students from prestigious private feeder schools are overrepresented in old boys clubs, while academic high achievers and ethnic minorities are almost completely absent. Club members earn $32\\%$ more than other students and are more likely to work in finance and join country clubs, both characteristic of the eras elite. We use random variation in room assignment to show that exposure to high-status peers expands gaps in college club membership, adult social club membership, and finance careers by high school type, with large positive effects for private school students and zero or negative effects for others. To conclude, we turn to more recent cohorts. We show that the link between exclusive college clubs and finance careers persists across the twentieth century even as Harvard diversifies, and that elite university students from the highest-income families continue to outearn their peers.",
    "30": "After decades of stagnation, the size of the middle class in Latin America and the Caribbean recently expanded by 50 percent from 103 million people in 2003 to 152 million (or 30 percent of the continent's population) in 2009. Over the same period, as household incomes grew and inequality edged downward in most countries, the proportion of people in poverty fell markedly: from 44 percent to 30 percent. As a result, the middle class and the poor now account for roughly the same share of Latin America's population. This is in stark contrast to the situation prevailing (for a long period) until about 10 years ago, when the share of the poor hovered around 2.5 times that of the middle class. This study investigates the nature, determinants, and possible consequences of this remarkable process of social transformation. Such large changes in the size and composition of social classes must, by definition, imply substantial economic mobility of some form. A large number of people who were poor in the late 1990s are now no longer poor. Others who were not yet middle class have now joined its ranks. But social and economic mobility does not mean the same thing to different people or in different contexts. This report discusses the relevant concepts and documents the facts about mobility in Latin America and the Caribbean over the past two decades, both within and between generations. In addition, it investigates the rise of the Latin American middle class over the past 10-15 years and explores the size, nature, and composition of this pivotal new social group. More speculatively, it also asks how the rising middle class may reshape the region's social contract.",
    "31": "In this paper we use the unusually large sample size of the Great British Class Survey to compare rates of social mobility into different elite occupations. We find a distinction between traditional professions, such as law, medicine and finance, which are dominated by the children of higher managers and professionals, and technical or emerging high-status occupations, particularly those related to IT, that appear to recruit more widely. Second, we find that even when the upwardly mobile are successful in entering elite occupations they invariably fail to accumulate the same economic, cultural and social capital as those from privileged backgrounds. While many such differences may be explained by inheritance, we also find that the mobile tend to have considerably lower incomes. Investigating this further we demonstrate that even when controlling for important variables such as schooling, education, location, age, and cultural and social capital, the upwardly mobile in eight occupations located largely in the business sector have considerably lower incomes than their higher-origin colleagues. These findings underline the value of analyses of mobility into specific high-status occupations as well as illustrating how, beyond entry, the mobile often face considerable disadvantage within occupations.",
    "32": "In the contemporary uncertain labour market situation, the tradition of upward mobility, or the chance for all workers to improve their earnings, may be a thing of the past in the United States of America (USA) In a competitive economic environment, many companies that once offered the opportunity for advancement to workers, have reinvented themselves as leaner enterprises with more flexible work forces. This publication presents empirical research into the prospects for upward mobility of workers in this new economic environment. The research is based on a comparison of the career outcomes of two generations of young, white men over the course of their working lives. It documents the gap between the upwardly mobile and the increasing numbers of workers trapped in low-wage jobs. The first generation entered the labour market during the late 1960s during a period of stability and prosperity. The second generation entered working life during the early 1980s, a period of recession, deregulation, and the weakening of organised labour. This comparative research reveals trends indicating that the new labour market is harsher than that of the 1960s. A 'pyramid' situation has evolved where highly qualified, well-connected workers at the top of the employment pyramid move from job to job, improving their earnings as they proceed, and a growing number of lower skilled workers are consigned to low paid, 'dead-end' jobs. The authors conclude with a discussion of policy strategies to improve career pathways and promote opportunities for all workers to enhance their earning power. The strategies are based on regional partnerships that link corporate, union, government, and community resources.",
    "33": "American workers' occupational status strongly reflects the status of their parents. Men and women who grew up in a two-earner or father-breadwinner family achieved occupations that rose 0.5 point for every one-point increase in their parents' statuses (less if their father was absent) Gender differences were small in two-earner families and mother-only families, but men's status persisted more when the father was the sole breadwinner. Intergenerational persistence did not change in the time the data cover (1994-2016) Absolute mobility declined for recent birth cohorts; barely half the men and women born in the 1980s were upwardly mobile compared with two-thirds of those born in the 1940s. The results as described hold for a socioeconomic index (SEI) that scores occupation according to the average pay and credentials of people in the occupation. Most results were the same when occupations were coded by different criteria, but SEI produced the smallest gender differences.",
    "34": "Cultural consumption is often viewed as a form of embodied cultural capital which can be converted into economic rewards (e.g. earnings) because such practices increase the likelihood of moving into more advantaged social positions. However, quantitative evidence supporting this theory remains uncertain because it is often unable to rule out alternative explanations. Cultural consumption appears to influence hiring decisions in some elite firms, in both the US and the UK, but it is unclear whether these processes are applicable to other professional occupations and other labour market processes, such as promotions. We examine these processes using data from Understanding Society, an individual-level panel survey conducted in the UK, allowing us to explore whether cultural consumption predicts future earnings, upward social mobility and promotions. People who consume a larger number of cultural activities are more likely to earn higher wages in the future, to be upwardly socially mobile, and to be promoted.

Among other topics, Professor Chetty covers how and why children's chances of climbing the income ladder vary across neighborhoods, how race still matters for economic mobility in the U.S. today, and the relationship between equality of opportunity, innovation, and growth.

    "36": "The Great Gatsby Curve, the observation that for OECD countries greater cross-sectional income inequality is associated with lower mobility, has become a prominent part of scholarly and policy discussions because of its implications for the relationship between inequality of outcomes and inequality of opportunities. We explore this relationship by focusing on evidence and interpretation of an intertemporal Gatsby Curve for the United States. We consider inequality/mobility relationships that are derived from nonlinearities in the transmission process of income from parents to children and the relationship that is derived from the effects of inequality of socioeconomic segregation, which then affects children. Empirical evidence for the mechanisms we identify is strong. We find modest reduced-form evidence and structural evidence of an intertemporal Gatsby Curve for the United States as mediated by social influences.",
    "37": ": Income inequality is often attributed to declines in income mobility following the Great Gatsby curve, but this relationship is of secondary importance in determining the factors of income mobility if one considers that changing rules is more important than changing outcomes under defined rules. Rather, improvements in institutional quality are hypothesized to increase income mobility by allowing entrepreneurs the freedom to pursue their dreams. This paper is the first to empirically analyze the institutional determinants behind entrepreneurship, and their effect on income mobility. The findings from a cross-country analysis suggest that secure property rights and less corruption are associated with less income persistence, leading to higher income mobility, independent of the Great Gatsby effect. This suggests that reducing corruption and protection of property rights increase income mobility through the channels of entrepreneurship.",
    "38": "This paper investigates the claim that the shift from a selective to a comprehensive school system had a deleterious effect on social mobility in Great Britain. Using data from the National Child Development Study, we compare the chances, for both class and income mobility, of those who attended different kinds of school. Where media attention focuses exclusively on the chances for upward mobility of those children from lowly origins who were (or would have been) judged worthy of selection into a grammar school, we offer more rounded analyses. We match respondents in a way that helps us to distinguish those inequalities in mobility chances that are due to differences between children from those due to differences between the schools they attended; we look at the effects of the school system on the mobility chances of all children, not merely those from less advantaged origins; and we compare comprehensive- and selective-system schools, not merely comprehensive and grammar schools. After matching, we find, first, that going to a grammar school rather than a comprehensive does not make low-origin children more likely to be upwardly mobile but it helps them move further if they are; second, that grammar schools do not benefit working-class children, in terms of class mobility, more than they benefit service-class children, but, in terms of income mobility, such schools benefit low-income children somewhat more than they benefit higher-income children - that benefit relating only to rather modest and limited movements within the income distribution. Finally, however, the selective system as a whole yields no mobility advantage of any kind to children from any particular origins: any assistance to low-origin children provided by grammar schools is cancelled out by the hindrance suffered by those who attended secondary moderns. Overall, our findings suggest that comprehensive schools were as good for mobility as the selective schools they replaced.",
    "39": "The hidden barriers, or gender pay gap, preventing women from earning equivalent incomes to men is well documented. Yet recent research has uncovered that, in Britain, there is also a comparable classorigin pay gap in higher professional and managerial occupations. So far this analysis has only been conducted at the national level and it is not known whether there are regional differences within the UK. This paper uses pooled data from the 2014 and 2015 Labour Force Survey ( N = 7,534) to stage a more spatially sensitive analysis that examines regional variation in the class pay gap. We find that this class ceiling is not evenly spatially distributed. Instead it is particularly marked in Central London, where those in highstatus occupations who are from workingclass backgrounds earn, on average, 10,660 less per year than those whose parents were in higher professional and managerial employment. Finally, we inspect the Capital further to reveal that the class pay gap is largest within Central London's banking and finance sector. Challenging policy conceptions of London as the engine room of social mobility, these findings suggest that class disadvantage within highstatus occupations is particularly acute in the Capital. The findings also underline the value of investigating regional differences in social mobility, and demonstrate how such analysis can unravel important and previously unrecognized spatial dimensions of class inequality.",

Data analyses were from March 2018 to June 2019.Parental income, measured at birth year and at child ages 5, 10, and 15 years.Hazard ratios (HRs) for schizophrenia were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. Cumulative incidence values (absolute risks) were also calculated.The cohort included 1 051 033 participants, of whom 51.3% were male. Of the cohort members, 7544 (4124 [54.7%] male) were diagnosed with schizophrenia during 11.6 million person-years of follow-up. There was an inverse association between parental income level and subsequent schizophrenia risk, with children from lower income families having especially elevated risk. Estimates were attenuated, but risk gradients remained after adjustment for urbanization, parental mental disorders, parental educational levels, and number of changes in child-parent separation status. A dose-response association was observed with increasing amount of time spent in low-income conditions being linked with higher schizophrenia risk. Regardless of parental income level at birth, upward income mobility was associated with lower schizophrenia risk compared with downward mobility. For example, children who were born and remained in the lowest income quintile at age 15 years had a 4.12 (95% CI, 3.71-4.58) elevated risk compared with the reference group, those who were born in and remained in the most affluent quintile, but even a rise from the lowest income quintile at birth to second lowest at age 15 years appeared to lessen the risk elevation (HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.46-3.17) On the contrary, for those born in the most affluent quintile, downward income mobility between birth and age 15 years was associated with increased risks of developing schizophrenia.This study's findings suggest that parental income level and income mobility during childhood may be linked with schizophrenia risk. Although both causation and selection mechanisms could be involved, enabling upward income mobility could influence schizophrenia incidence at the population level.",

However, this recession has affected middle-income families, whose experiences with economic challenge have seldom been looked at in any detail. Such families have been recently called the new poor, the missing middle, and families in the middle. One in seven American children under age 18 (10.5 million) has an unemployed parent as a result of this recession, and because economic mobility for children in the U.S. is affected by their parents earning capacities, their mobility potential may be mediated by parents strategies for childrens educational futures. The research presented here, which is informed by Weberian stratification theory and capital theories, is based on a longitudinal subset of a larger two-country, multicity, mixed-methods study that used surveys and qualitative semi-structured interviews to explore how middle-income families contend with economic downturn and how their adolescent childrens educational futures might be influenced. Our findings suggest that most families maintain their childrens developmental and educational status quo, but their strategies to do so constrict the potential for educational attainment. As such, the American approach to off-loading much of the cost of higher education to middle-income families who are economically stressed is not viable if we hope to maximize the number of children who will receive mobility-enhancing postsecondary education.",

We investigated parental income trajectories during childhood and subsequent risks of self-harm and violent criminality in young adulthood.MethodsUsing Danish national registers, we delineated a nested case-control study of Danish citizens born from Jan 1, 1982, to Dec 31, 2000, with first hospital-treated self-harm episodes and first violent crime convictions at ages 1533 years. Each case was matched on age and gender to 25 randomly selected controls. Parental income was assessed in birth-year and at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years. We considered parental age, the child's number of siblings, parental mental health, and parental education to be covariates. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by conditional logistic regression inherently adjusted for age, gender, and calendar year; we then made additional adjustments for the covariates considered.FindingsWe identified 21 267 first episodes of hospital-treated self-harm, to which we matched 531 675 controls, and 23 724 first violent crime convictions, to which we matched 593 100 controls. We observed inverse relationships between parental income and risks for the two outcomes for each of the ages parental income was measured. The longer a child lived in poorer circumstances, the higher their subsequent risks for self-harm and violent criminality, and vice versa for time spent living in affluent conditions. Associations were stronger for violent criminality than for self-harm. Compared with individuals who were born and remained in the most affluent families, all other income trajectories were associated with elevated risks for both outcomes. Those who remained in the least affluent quintile showed the highest risks for self-harm (IRR 72, 95% CI 6679; 1174 [6%] cases) and for violent criminality (IRR 130; 95% CI 119141; 1640 [7%] cases) The risk patterns were attenuated, but essentially persisted, after covariate adjustment. For any parental income level at birth, being upwardly mobile was associated with lower risk compared with downward mobility.InterpretationParental income represents a multitude of unmeasured familial sociodemographic indices.

    "48": "This paper reconsiders some of the evidence for low and declining social mobility in Britain, showing that one study based on a reanalysis of cohort figures appears to have had an impact on policymakers out of all proportion to its scale and rigour. The study claimed to show that the income of parents and children were more closely related for sons born in 1970 than in 1958, and that therefore social mobility was declining. It also claimed to show that the incomes of fathers and sons were more closely related in Britain than in countries such as Norway. However, a reconsideration of the same results in this paper leads to very different conclusions. This example is considered in detail here to illustrate the point that it is not always a good thing for research to have influence.

    "49": "SUMMARY Immigrants' labour market situation has been in the focus of research in economics as well as in other sciences, and the labour market situation of immigrants and their children (i.e. first and secondgeneration immigrants) is relatively well documented in many countries today. However, less attention has up to now been paid to the labour market and earnings situation among the grandchildren of immigrants, i.e. thirdgeneration immigrants. Against this background, this paper studies intergenerational earnings mobility and the earnings position of three generations of immigrants in Sweden. The results indicate a regression towards the native earnings mean in immigrant earnings across the first two generations in the sense that immigrants earn more than natives in the first generation while there are small ethnic earnings in the second generation. Furthermore, immigrants earn less than natives in the third generation. Thus, the results suggest a downward trend in immigrants' relative earnings across generations. One conclusion of the study is that ethnic differences in earnings may occur beyond the second generation of immigrants and that the problem with integration of immigrants therefore may last for several generations.",
    "50": "Much research has viewed immigrant entrepreneurship positively because of its reputed role in immigrant economic adaptation. With the growing professionalization of children of Korean immigrant proprietors, small business ownership is seen as a stepping-stone to intergenerational mobility. To assess whether immigrant entrepreneurship serves as springboard to upward mobility for the second generation, this article compares the educational and occupational achievements between children of entrepreneurs and children of professionals. The comparisons reveal that a higher proportion of children of professionals attended selective colleges, obtained professional occupations, and earned competitive salaries. Results from multiple regression analyses also indicate that entrepreneurship was not a good predictor of college selectivity and earnings for the second generation. Nevertheless, children of entrepreneurs attained comparable educational and occupational achievements as those of children of professionals, suggesting that rapid financial security through entrepreneurship can replicate similar residential and educational opportunities for children of entrepreneurs. While the springboard and safety net functions of small business on inter-generational mobility are salient, in some circumstances, obligations to help out in a family business can lead to personal sacrifice on the part of children of entrepreneurs, constraining their educational and occupational choices and leading some toward downward mobility.",

Social class is established on the basis of parents' earnings rank. By exploiting variation in immigration patterns over time across commuting zones, we find that immigration from lowincome countries has reduced social mobility and thus steepened the social gradient in natives' labor market outcomes, whereas immigration from highincome countries has leveled it. Given the large inflow of immigrants from low-income countries to Norway since the early 1990s, this can explain a considerable part of the relative decline in economic performance among natives with lower class background, and also rationalize the apparent polarization of sentiments toward immigration.",

We review conceptual and methodological approaches to examining health inequality across the life course and highlight the contribution of a person-centered, disaggregated approach to modeling health and its association with long-term pathways of economic resources, including changing resources associated with mobility. Findings suggest those who experienced early mobility out of economic hardship were less likely than those in persistent economic hardship to experience a high-risk health trajectory, while experiencing later mobility did not lessen this risk. We conclude with a call for further investigation into the role of social mobility and the timing, degree, and direction of change in investigations of health inequality.",

However, recent studies of upward mobility, where a child goes on to achieve higher socioeconomic status than his or her parents, suggest that it entails a tradeoff between better psychological well-being and worse cardiometabolic health. In this study, we consider further evidence of this tradeoff in 2 multidecade studies, asking how upward income mobility relates to subsequent perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and metabolic syndrome. We ask parallel questions about downward mobility. Finally, given shifting patterns of mobility in recent generations, we also consider whether mobility's association with health outcomes differs for individuals born in the middle and later parts of the 20th century. Methods and Results We analyzed prospective data from Add Health (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; N=7542) and MIDUS (Midlife in the United States Study; N=1877) In both studies, evidence of the tradeoff was observed. Upward mobility presaged lower perceived stress and fewer depressive symptoms, in combination with higher metabolic syndrome rates. In contrast, downward mobility presaged worse outcomes on all health indicators. The magnitude of the mobility-health associations was similar across cohorts. Conclusions These findings provide evidence that upward income mobility is associated with a tradeoff between well-being and cardiometabolic health. The similarity of the findings across cohorts suggests that this tradeoff is a generalized consequence of ascending the socioeconomic hierarchy, at least for Americans born in the middle and later parts of the 20th century.",

In this setup, it is shown that progressive income tax can be a welfare-enhancing tool by increasing social mobility.

In recent years, educational assortative mating has become a trend in China, and this marital sorting pattern not only contributes to marriage stability but is also related to increased income mobility. Educational assortative mating affects the distribution of educational resources among families with diffferent educational qualifications. Families with higher educational qualifications have more educational resources, thus obtaining a more solid income status. Educational assortative mating has the most significant influence on the income mobility of the low-income group, as high-quality educational resources are the key to enabling this group to raise its income status. This paper argues that, in the future, income mobility should be promoted by evenly distributing social education resources and reducing the resource constraints on the upward mobility of the low-income group.",

Taking a sociocultural perspective on social class, we argue that a key contributor to the class pay gap is that people from upper-class origins tend to work in occupations with greater autonomy, whereas their lower-class counterparts tend to work in occupations that are more prosocial. We further propose that autonomous occupations pay better than prosocial occupations. Across two distinct nationally representative samples in the United States, we find that people with upper-class (vs. lower-class) parents are more likely to work in autonomous occupations, but less likely to work in prosocial occupations, even when controlling for education, occupational prestige, and other potential confounds. This pattern of occupational sorting explains a substantial portion of the class pay gap.

These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analyzing their associations with economic mobility across areas.

If children with low-SES parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-SES parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20% on average.

Compared to educational immobility, extreme downward educational mobility corresponded to elevated odds of reporting good/fair/poor health among women (OR = 3.053; 95% CI = 0.991 9.393) Compared to income immobility, downward income mobility in general (OR = 1.533; 95% CI = 1.115 2.106) and extreme downward income mobility in particular (OR = 2.389; 95% CI = 1.481 3.854) both corresponded to elevated odds of reporting good/fair/poor health among women.

Moreover, we find evidence for extended family compensation in completing upper secondary education and the avoidance of low pay in both countries. The results suggest that compensation by aunts and uncles takes place for the avoidance of marginalization and is particularly likely when both parents and grandparents have low resources.",
    "71": "A recent literature studies the role of grandparents in status transmission. Results have been mixed, and theoretical contributions highlight biases that complicate the interpretation of these studies. We use newly harmonized income tax records on more than 700,000 Swedish lineages to establish four empirical facts. First, a model that includes both mothers and fathers and takes a multidimensional view of stratification reduces the residual three-generation association in our population to a trivial size. Second, data on fathers' cognitive ability show that even extensive controls for standard socioeconomic variables fail to remove omitted variable bias. Third, the common finding that grandparents compensate poor parental resources can be attributed to greater difficulty of observing parent status accurately at the lower end of the distribution. Fourth, the lower the data quality, and the less detailed the model, the greater is the size of the estimated grandparent coefficient. Future work on multigenerational mobility should pay less attention to the size and significance of this association, which depends heavily on arbitrary sample and specification characteristics, and go on to establish a set of more robust descriptive facts.",
    "72": "Using results from two treatment arms of a larger nationwide survey experiment in the United States, we add evidence on how Americans perceive social mobility. In one arm, respondents estimate both upward and downward relative economic mobility, while in the other, respondents estimate the absolute economic mobility (that is, do children out-earn their parents?) for each quintile of the parental income distribution. This latter question has been overlooked in the literature. We find respondents average estimates of relative downward mobility to be remarkably close to reality. The average estimate of relative upward mobility is also close, though both estimates underestimate relative mobility. There are small partisan differences in accuracy on relative mobility, with Republican-leaning respondents providing the most accurate estimates, but respondents perception of absolute mobility significantly underestimate (overestimate) mobility for the poorest (highest-income) children irrespective of partisan affiliation. Our results provide important insights on the implementation of redistribution policies.",
    "73": "In this article, we explore nonlinearities in the intergenerational mobility process using threshold regression models. We uncover evidence of threshold effects in children's outcomes based on parental education and cognitive and noncognitive skills as well as their interaction with offspring characteristics. We interpret these thresholds as organizing dynastic earning processes into status traps. Status traps, unlike poverty traps, are not absorbing states. Rather, they reduce the impact of favorable shocks for disadvantaged children and so inhibit upward mobility in ways not captured by linear models. Our evidence of status traps is based on three complementary datasets; that is, the PSID, the NLSY, and US administrative data at the commuting zone level, which together suggest that the threshold-like mobility behavior we observe in the data is robust for a range of outcomes and contexts.",

Our model links occupational status and earnings to the social resources of education and father's socioeconomic status, using data from the Panel Study of Income 1981. The results suggest that such resources operated more strongly for advantaged blacks than for whites. But for less advantaged blacks, race remained a significant barrier. As predicted by the polarization hypothesis, enforcement of affirmative action guidelines was beneficial, but only to more qualified blacks.",

We first offer a brief review of Vietnamese refugee resettlement in the US and the making of a new ethnic community. We then provide a quantitative analysis of socioeconomic mobility among Vietnamese refugees using American Community Survey data from 1980 to 2015 and other national-level data. We examine how this ethnic population has changed over time by focusing on key socioeconomic indicators, such as levels of education, occupation, and income, as well as poverty rates. Third, we seek to explain what enables Vietnamese refugees and their children to overcome initial disadvantage and move up in society based on our own work over the span of 20 years with qualitative data. We consider how policies, institutions (government, civil society, and ethnic) and patterns of social relations in the Vietnamese American community have interacted with individual agency to shape mobility.",
    "76": "Gender and racial pay penalties are well-known: women (of all races) and people of color (of all genders) earn less, on average, even when they gain access to occupations historically reserved for White men. Studies of social mobility show that people from working-class backgrounds in the US have also been excluded from top professional and managerial occupations. But do working-class-origin people who attain top US jobs face a class-origin pay penalty? Despite evidence of class-origin pay gaps in higher professional and managerial occupations elsewhere, we might expect that the central role of race and racism in US stratification processes, along with the relatively low salience of class identities, would render class origins irrelevant to earnings in exclusive occupations, at least within racial groups. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to link childhood class position to adult occupation and earnings, we describe the racial and class-origin composition of different high-status occupations and the earnings of people within them. We show that when people who are from working-class backgrounds are upwardly mobile into high-status occupations, they earn almost $20,000 per year less, on average, than individuals who are themselves from privileged backgrounds. The difference is partly explained by the upwardly mobile being less likely to have college degrees, but it remains substantial (around $11,700) even after accounting for education, race and other important predictors of earnings. The gap is largest among White people; there is a class-origin penalty in top US occupations that is distinct from the racial pay gap.",

I found that whether a mother was economically independent and had an income similar to that of the father during her childrens late childhood and adolescence positively associated with upward mobility. The results show a substantial association of mothers income position to their daughters mobility, but not for sons. Among the primary mechanisms, I argue that extra resources from mothers helped human capital investment through education and that mothers influenced daughters by a gendered role model.",

We have to know why we care about a particular pattern of mobility to know how to set about measuring it. The distinction between relative and absolute mobility is a case in point. Do we care most about whether people are better off than their parents, or about how much movement there is up and down the income ladder? Technical difficulties abound for the measurement of mobility. It is important not to lose sight of the motivation for the exercise: measuring how far the inequality patterns of one generation are impressed upon the next, understanding these replication processes empirically, and weakening them. America has a historic commitment to the ideal of equality of opportunity. Data on mobility, then, comprise the measure of the nation.",
    "79": "Although the precise definition of social mobility is a matter of debate, it is associated to a situation in which the relative economic status of an agent is not dependent on starting conditions such as parental income or family background. Analyzing the determinants of mobility involves exploring the channels through which offspring's income is correlated to its parents' such as education, opportunities or economic status. This survey explores in an analytical framework, the relation between social mobility and inequality, among other important dimensions of income distribution that are jointly determined. The focus is on the relevance of social mobility as it affects variables determining welfare and economic efficiency, and therefore on policies to promote it.",
    "80": "Empirical evidence on distributional preferences shows that people do not judge inequality as problematic per se but that they take into account the fairness or unfairness of the outcome. This article conceptualizes a view of unfair inequality and introduces a new measure of inequality based on two widely held fairness principles: equality of opportunity and freedom from poverty. It develops a method for decomposing inequality and its trends into an unfair and a fair component. We provide two empirical applications of our measure. First, we analyse the development of inequality in the US from 1969 to 2014 from a fairness perspective. Second, we conduct a corresponding international comparison between the US and 31 European countries in 2010. Our results document that unfair inequality matches the well-documented inequality growth in the US since 1980. This trend is driven by decreases in social mobility, i.e. increasing importance of parental education and occupation for the income of their children. Among the 32 countries of our international comparison, the land of opportunity ranks among the most unfair societies in 2010.",
    "81": "Class structure and class formation are two crucial aspects of class. The former relates to differences in market positions and the latter concerns social factors such as interaction, mobility and class action. This paper is based on Swedish data covering the period from 1975 to 1995. Analysis reveals a persistent class hierarchy and that there is no trend towards declining class differences regarding market position. The situation is better described as being in a state of non-linear flux. However, one persistent trend is discernible; class explains less and less of the variance in wage income. Looking at class formation there is a decline over time in class-homogeneity. Most Swedes are mobile in the sense that they end up in a class position different from their father's. A growing majority of all marriage is also class mixed. However, although classes generally lack homogeneity, social boundaries still exist, i.e. tendencies for immobility and class homogeneous marriage. In relation to the `class-is-dying' hypothesis, the results generally indicate the continuing relevance of class, although the view of classes as homogeneous social groups is increasingly troublesome over time.",
    "82": "In this paper we demonstrate the way in which class origin shapes earnings in higher professional and managerial employment. Taking advantage of newly released class origin data in Britains Labour Force Survey, we examine both the relative openness of different high-status occupations and the earnings of the upwardly mobile within them. In terms of access, we find a distinction between traditional professions, such as law, medicine and finance, which are dominated by the children of higher managers and professionals, and more technical occupations such as engineering and IT that recruit more widely. However, even when those who are not from professional or managerial backgrounds are successful in entering high-status occupations, they earn sixteen percent less, on average, than those from privileged backgrounds. This class-origin pay gap translates to up to 7,350 ($11,000) lower annual earnings. This difference is partly explained by the upwardly mobile being employed in smaller firms and working outside London, but it remains substantial even net of a variety of important predictors of earnings. These findings underline the value of investigating differences in mobility rates between individual occupations as well as illustrating how, beyond entry, the mobile often face an earnings class ceiling within high-status occupations.",
    "83": "This paper uses individual data on 6,873 male employees from the I972 General Household Survey in the U.K. to assess the extent to which differences in personal characteristics explain differences in occupational and economic success. This is done by means of a path model fitted on the following key variables: father's occupation, respondent's occupation, education, ability and earnings. In addition, alternative specifications of the same basic model are fitted involving age or experience as an additional variable and different proxies for the ability variable. The results indicate that personal characteristics explain about onethird on the variance in earnings in the U.K. and that education is an important contributor to economic and social ascent. Although this finding is in slight variance with the conclusion of a similar study by Jencks using U.S. data, it is noted that the differences in results might be due to our inadequacy in matching the exact definition of variables for the purpose of international comparisons of the kind attempted here. 'Neither family background, cognitive skill, educational attainment, nor occupational status explains much of the variation in men's incomes.' This was Jencks' conclusion after an analysis of the determinants of adult success in America that is now widely cited around the world.2 This paper reports the results of a similiar analysis for the U.K. Using data on individual characteristics of nearly 7,ooo men, I show that personal characteristics explain a higher fraction of earnings variance in the U.K. than in the U.S. and that education has a sizeable direct effect on income as well as an indirect effiect through occupation. Section I briefly describes the data and defines the basic variables used in the analysis. Section II presents a path model of the determination of earnings a la Jencks.

I also try to answer some peripheral questions on the role of ability in the earnings determining process and the existence or not of an interaction effect between ability and education. Section IV examines the extent to which social mobility relates to schooling, the dependent variable now being the social distance travelled between father's and son's occupational status. SectionV discusses the policy conclusions stemming from the empirical results.",
    "84": "This paper presents an analysis of what types of values, especially in regard to obedience vs. independence, families impart to their children, and how these values interact with social mobility. In the model, obedience is a useful characteristic for employers, especially when wages are low, because independent workers require more incentives (when wages are high, these incentives are automatic) Hence in lowwage environments, lowincome families will impart values of obedience to their children to prevent disadvantaging them in the labour market. To the extent that independence is useful for entrepreneurial activities, this then depresses their social mobility. Highincome and privileged parents, on the other hand, always impart values of independence, since they expect that their children can enter into higherincome entrepreneurial (or managerial) activities thanks to their family resources and privileges. I also discuss how political activity can be hampered when labour market incentives encourage greater obedience, and how this can generate multiple steady states with different patterns of social hierarchy and mobility.",
    "85": "The Opportunity Atlas project is a pioneering effort to trace social mobility and adulthood socioeconomic outcomes back to childhood residence. Half of the variation in adulthood socioeconomic outcomes was explainable by neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics during childhood. Clustering census tracts by Opportunity Atlas characteristics would allow for further exploration of variance in social mobility. Our objectives here are to identify and describe spatial clustering trends within Opportunity Atlas outcomes.We utilized a k-means clustering machine learning approach with four outcome variables (individual income, incarceration rate, employment, and percent of residents living in a neighborhood with low levels of poverty) each given at five parental income levels (1st, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentiles of the national distribution) to create clusters of census tracts across the contiguous United States (US) and within each Environmental Protection Agency region.At the national level, the algorithm identified seven distinct clusters; the highest opportunity clusters occurred in the Northern Midwest and Northeast, and the lowest opportunity clusters occurred in rural areas of the Southwest and Southeast. For regional analyses, we identified between five to nine clusters within each region. PCA loadings fluctuate across parental income levels; income and low poverty neighborhood residence explain a substantial amount of variance across all variables, but there are differences in contributions across parental income levels for many components.Using data from the Opportunity Atlas, we have taken four social mobility opportunity outcome variables each stratified at five parental income levels and created nationwide and EPA region-specific clusters that group together census tracts with similar opportunity profiles. The development of clusters that can serve as a combined index of social mobility opportunity is an important contribution of this work, and this in turn can be employed in future investigations of factors associated with children's social mobility.",

    "87": "We present evidence that the recent fall Latin America inequality has been associated with higher social mobility across countries and over time. This correlation refers to what Alan Krueger and his CEA staff labeled the Great Gatsby Curve, but this is one of the first papers to test the Gatsby correlation over time. Our search for Gatsby curve correlates starts with classic mobility models where high Mincer coefficients and skilled wage-premia enhance wealthier parents ability to impart advantage to their children. We also refer to Gary Solon and others updates of their model to emphasize the potential of social policy to assist low-income children. Using Andersens education mobility measure for teens over a panel of sixteen Latin American economies we test the robustness and correlates of mobility and inequality. We find higher social expenditure, access to credit and particularly conditional cash transfers increase mobility as do falling skill-premia and lower returns to female education. More important, Latin American social policy designed to reduce poverty and inequality in the short run also increased education enrollments and therefore social mobility over the longer term. Hence we find falling inequality is associated with rising social mobility over twenty plus years and across sixteen Latin American countries, as the Great Gatsby curve suggests.",
    "88": "In the past decades, income inequality has risen in most developed countries. There is growing interest among economists in international comparisons of economic and educational mobility. This is aided by the availability of internationally comparable, large-scale data. The present paper aims to make three contributions. First, we introduce the Japan Child Panel Survey (JCPS) the first longitudinal survey of school-age children that includes cognitive and non-cognitive measures, and plentiful household information. The JCPS was developed to measure dynamic inter-relationships among childrens academic and social outcomes, their family background, and local policy and environment, in a way that allows comparison of the results with international data. Second, based on JCPS data, we present selected results of the dynamics of inequality in multiple indicators of childrens educational and behavioral outcomes. We found that changes in cognitive achievement across parental income groups, the degree of mobility of cognitive test scores, and the correlation between the difficulty score and parental education in Japan are similar to those of other countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany. Finally we discuss issues underlying the globalization of education research based on our experiences with the JCPS. We discuss reasons and strategies for further globalization of education research in Japan, and propose suggestions as to how Japanese education research can move toward better international collaboration, particularly in research on economic and educational mobility.",
    "89": "This article examines academic and economic progression of 8th graders using the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS 88) In terms of educational mobility, this analysis indicates it is clearly better to possess academic ability- middle-school students who have high-academic ability but low family socioeconomic status (SES) obtain baccalaureate degrees at over twice the rate of modest-ability students from affluent families. The findings in this article indicate considerable economic mobility. Over one in five middle-school students whose family was in the lowest SES quartile had advanced to the highest SES quartile as young adults- the keys to this advancement are attainment of the baccalaureate degree, attendance in a private middle school, and an intensive curriculum in high school. This does not diminish the strong positive effect that parental income has on student success; however, it clearly indicates that students from the lowest SES can achieve economic and academic success, despite meager economic resources.",
    "90": "Importance Upward income mobility is associated with better health outcomes and reduced stress. However, opportunities are unequally distributed, particularly so for those in rural communities and whose family have lower educational attainment. Objective To test the impact of parental supervision on their childrens income two decades later adjusting for parental economic and educational status. Design This study is a longitudinal, representative cohort study. From 19932000, annual assessments of 1,420 children were completed until age 16, then followed up at age 35, 20182021, for further assessment. Models tested direct effects of parental supervision on child income, and indirect effects via child educational attainment. Setting This study is an ongoing longitudinal population-based study of families in 11 predominately rural counties of the Southeastern U.S. Participants About 8% of the residents and sample are African American and fewer than 1% are Hispanic. American Indians make up 4% of the population in study but were oversampled to make up 25% of the sample. 49% of the 1,420 participants are female. Main outcomes and measures 1258 children and parents were assessed for sex, race/ethnicity, household income, parent educational attainment, family structure, child behavioral problems, and parental supervision. The children were followed up at age 35 to assess their household income and educational attainment. Results Parental educational attainment, income, and family structure were strongly associated with their childrens household income at age 35 (e.g. r = .392, p &lt; .05) Parental supervision of the child was associated with increased household income for the child at age 35, adjusting for SES of the family of origin. Children of parents who did not engage in adequate supervision earned approximately $14,000 less/year (i.e. ~13% of the samples median household income) than those who did. The association of parental supervision and child income at 35 was mediated by the childs educational attainment. Conclusion and relevance This study suggests adequate parental supervision during early adolescence is associated with childrens economic prospects two decades later, in part by improving their educational prospects. This is particularly important in areas such as rural Southeast U.S.",
    "91": "This paper studies the effects of migrations on growth and income distribution when social mobility is imperfect. Workers migrate in response to differences in expected wages between home and a foreign country, but their choice depends also whether they qualified themselves as skilled workers by accumulating human capital or not. Such an activity has a cost, which depends on each agents family background: sons of skilled workers have lower human capital accumulation costs. The effects of labour migrations on per capita income depend only on the degree of social mobility: if there is a difference in the cost of accumulating human capital for the sons of educated and noneducated people, migrations reduce total earnings of unskilled workers in the receiving country, and increase those of skilled workers.",

    "93": "Height and labor market outcomes appear to be related to one another. The taller people are, the more likely they are to have better jobs and to earn more money. This is especially the case for men. However, whether height is causally related to labor market outcomes is an open question, which instrumental variable (IV) analysis may help to answer. To our knowledge, no study has yet used IV analysis to test these relationships in a historical context. The present study addressed this gap, by examining height's relationship to occupational status and intergenerational mobility in a sample of Dutch men, birth years 1850 through 1900. Data were drawn from: the Historical Sample of the Netherlands, providing life course information on the research person; the Heights and Life Courses Database, providing information on the research person's height at conscription; and the Male Kin Height Database, providing information on the average height of the research person's full brothers. This combination of data sources yielded a sample of 1,465 men. Height z-score's relationships to occupational status (characterized as HISCAM score) and to intergenerational mobility (characterized as the difference between research person's HISCAM score and father's HISCAM score) were examined. The average of brothers' heights z-score was used as an instrumental variable. In terms of results, one standard deviation increase in height was associated with a 1.370 increase in HISCAM score (95% CI: 0.3102.429) and a 1.127 increase in intergenerational mobility score (95% CI: 0.1142.368) As Dutch men were growing taller and had greater abilities to choose their occupations, it appeared that tallness was associated with a better job, and increased intergenerational occupational mobility. This study thus offered preliminary evidence that height and labor market outcomes were perhaps causally related during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",

The Life Chances Study is a longitudinal study initiated by the Brotherhood of St Laurence to explore the impacts of family income and associated factors on children growing up. The study commenced with 167 children born in inner Melbourne in 1990. All the families have been interviewed at six stages, most recently when the children were aged 11 and 12. Data was collected from the children themselves, their parents and teachers. This article draws on the longitudinal data to discuss some of the changes the families have undergone over the children's early years, including geographic mobility, family structure and family income. Three-quarters of the children who were born into low-income families remained in low-income families 12 years later. Case studies of children who have grown up in families on low incomes are presented. The children's own views are outlined and some of the policy implications raised.",
    "95": "Chinas controversial and far reaching One Child Policy (OCP) introduced in 1979 changed fundamentally the nature of both existing and anticipated marriage arrangements and influenced family formation decisions in many dimensions especially with respect to the number of and investment in children. It may well be expected to have influenced their well being and life chances. Child poverty, or the over-representation of children in the poverty group, has been a major policy issue in some western societies. In the United Kingdom and Canada its elimination has been a declared policy target, in the USA, its deleterious consequences have been attacked with policies promoting generational mobility (i.e. policies to reduce the dependence of child outcomes on parental circumstances) under an equal opportunities imperative. Here we look at the impact of the OCP on child poverty and generational mobility in the context of the parent/child educational attainments and incomes. Using data drawn from an urban household survey carried out in six provinces in China, namely Shaanxi, Jilin, Hubei, Sichuan, Guangdong and Shandong (the first two may be considered low, the second two intermediate and the third pair high income provinces) the impact of the OCP on child poverty and generational mobility is studied. We examine how the OCP influenced investment in children by studying the way in which the relationship between the educational attainment of children and family characteristics changed with the introduction of the OCP. Broadly speaking the impact of household income and parental educational attainment has increased significantly over time, there appears to be an emerging negative household size effect and a negative birth order effect suggesting that the level of investment in children diminished with the size of the family. Finally a positive gender effect emerged (girls advanced more than boys) Examination of the proportion of children in the poverty group (defined by incomes below various proportions of median income) revealed that, unlike western societies, children are not overrepresented in the poverty group, neither before nor after the OCP. As for mobility, applying new techniques for measuring its degree we observe that the life chances of children born under its regimen have improved substantially but become increasingly dependent upon their parental circumstances. Thus, consistent with the increased parental investment per child that the OCP engendered, there is a much closer association between the characteristics of subsequent generations or a substantial reduction in generational mobility. This phenomenon is found to be particularly prevalent in the lower income quantiles reinforcing a dynastic notion of poverty.",

The results of Tobit model indicate that household income, head education, head age, household size, number of school-age children and residing in urban areas are the most significant factors affecting education expenditure. Interestingly, the results show that the income elasticity of education in urban sample model is greater than that of rural model, implying that households residing in urban areas are likely to spend more on education. In addition, the effect of household income is found to be positive and significant in the highest income quintile. Overall, the results revealed that households with higher income, whose heads are educated and reside in urban areas tends to spend more on education compared to poor and rural households. These results signify the lack of inter-generational educational and income mobility in Sudan, implying that children from poor households are caught permanently in low income and educational levels, and are not able to catch up their peers in high income families.

    "98": "While inter-generational income mobility is commonly understood to be socially desirable in that it promotes equality of life chances, social desirability of intra-generational income mobility is a much more controversial issue, which is known to be concerned with inequality and uncertainty effects, as well as aversion to income fluctuations. In this paper social welfare effects of intra-generational income mobility are investigated from the perspective of an opportunity egalitarian social planner. We show that, given the trade-off between inequality and uncertainty effects, social desirability of income mobility strongly depends on the characteristics of income switchings which are required to be rewarding the more deserving individuals and/or compensating the unluckier ones. In this sense, we suggest that egalitarianism of opportunity, more than aversion to intertemporal fluctuations, is crucial for motivating the optimality of empirically observed low degrees of income mobility as compared to perfect mobility processes (complete reversal)",
    "99": "Regional public universities educate approximately 70 percent of college students at four-year public universities and an even larger share of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. They aim to provide opportunity for education and social mobility, in part by locating near potential students. In this paper, we use the historical assignment of normal schools and insane asylums (normal schools grew into regional universities while asylums remain small) and data from Opportunity Insights to identify the effects of regional universities on the social mobility of nearby children. Children in counties given a normal school get more education and have better economic and social outcomes, especially lower-income children. For several key outcomes, we show this effect is a causal effect on children, and not only selection on which children live near universities.",
    "100": "From 1944 to 1952, largely agrarian Finland had to export, on average, 4% of its yearly GDP in industrial products to the Soviet Union as war reparations. To meet the reparation demands, the Finnish state needed to provide extensive but temporary support to Soviet-assigned industries with insufficient production capacity. This paper documents the long-term impacts of this extensive and temporary industrial policy on industrial and local development and on individual outcomes. Using newly digitized datasets, I show in a difference-in-differences setup that the short-term nonmarket production persistently and significantly increased the employment and production of the manufacturing industries exposed to the policy. These industries plausibly benefited from large initial investments and exposure to export markets associated with the war reparations. The episode further led to local development and structural change, as the more exposed regions became persistently more industrialized. I substantiate these within-Finland results with triple-difference setups employing comparable Norwegian data. I further use Finnish administrative data to study the long-term individual impacts of the episode. Tracking individuals over 30 years, I show that the initial state investments and the persistent change in the local industrial structure increased long-term incomes, led to more educational attainment, and promoted the upward mobility of children and young adults living in the more exposed regions prior to the war reparations period. The observed effects are driven by the more advanced heavy industry, which received the majority of state assistance.",

    "102": "This study assesses the effects of Head Start and other preschool programs on five life success measures in a U.S. cohort of youth (N = 5,621) The life success indices are average annual income-to-poverty ratios, economic mobility, and number of years the youth lived in families whose incomes fell below official poverty thresholds, received Food Stamps, and received TANF/AFDC. Controlling for a variety of background and other factors in separate regression models for each life success measure, results show that youth who participated in preschool programs other than Head Start had higher average annual income-to-poverty ratios than non-preschoolers. Bivariate findings corroborate previous research indicating that Head Starters are economically and behaviorally disadvantaged compared to both other preschool and non-preschool children. Multivariate findings of this study also show that Head Starters do as well as non-preschoolers in regard to the four other life success measures. In essence, on these measures Head Starters become mainstreamed by the time they enter the labor force, start their own families, and form their own households, such that they fare no better or worse than other preschoolers and non-preschoolers in regard to economic mobility, years lived in poor families, and receipt of Food Stamps and TANF/AFDC. Findings support continued funding of Head Start but also suggest that higher levels of funding may be necessary to raise family incomes above poverty comparable to other preschool programs. ********** This study examines long-term effects of preschool intervention programs on a U.S. cohort of youth. Controlling for a variety of background, early childhood, sociodemographic, human capital, structural, and other factors, the author seeks to determine how those who participated in Head Start and other preschool programs fared in regard to economic well-being compared to those who had no preschool experience. The study uses data from the 1979 Cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) Over the past several decades, scholars and others have devoted much attention to Head Start and other preschool interventions like the Perry Preschool Project and the Abecedarian Project. The related literature is extensive and sufficiently covered elsewhere (e.g. Children's Defense ; ; McKey, et al. 1985; ; ; ) notes that the literature is mixed in regard to Head Start's enabling poor families to break the cycle of disadvantage and his study of the children of NLSY79 mothers shows that Head Start children spend more time in persistent poverty than other children from poor families and benefit from behavioral and emotional adjustments. In an earlier NLSY79 study, report short-term cognitive gains, but possible negative effects on emotional development. also relying on the NLSY79, report that the short-term cognitive gains among both whites and blacks were quickly lost among blacks. In a more recent meta-analysis of 35 studies published between 1990 and 2000 that assessed short- and long-term benefits of preschool programs, finds large positive effects on standardized measures of academic achievement and intelligence, lasting even after 5 to 10 years, and substantial lessening of personal and social problems measured by cumulative indices over a 10- to 25-year period for those who had attended preschool (e.g. school drop out, welfare dependence, unemployment, and poverty. Also see Reynolds, Temple, Robertson, & ) Gorey notes however that preschool programs like Head Start are generally placed at the low end of a continuum in terms of the amount of preschool intervention and his findings suggest that both short- and long-term benefits are associated primarily with the more intensive programs like the Perry Preschool and the Abecedarian Project.",

Parents income has come mainly from agricultural sources while childrens income has come largely from nonfarm sources. Initially, poverty is higher among the landless households. Children from poor landless households are able to find their way out of poverty by acquiring more education, participating in rural nonfarm labor market, and migrating to big cities, local towns, and overseas. Migrant children have higher total income coming mainly from nonfarm income, which is significantly affected by education. In brief, this study demonstrates the rise in economic importance of education and the decline in economic importance of farmland in explaining economic mobility.

Using various micro data sources, we uncover a steep decline in absolute mobility rates from 81 percent to 59 percent for childrens birth cohorts 1962 through 1988. This trend is robust across different ages, family sizes, measurement methods, copulas, and data sources. Across the parental income distribution, we find that children from middle class families experienced the largest percentage point drop in absolute income mobility (-31pp) Our counterfactual analysis shows that lower economic growth rates and higher income inequality contributed similarly to these trends.",

Pseudo-panel data were obtained from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Our results indicate that rapid higher education expansion has a negative impact on social mobility for the generation who enters the labor market after the expansion starting point.",

The article illustrates how the transnational connections of nurses create cleavages among them as a micro-class category in the host state and argues how the social class position of the family continues to impact on the class conditions of migrants especially those from lower income backgrounds. In contrast, the financial independence of higher income families leads to better life chances for nurses allowing them to invest in additional economic capital, pursue personal projects and improve their symbolic capital. This can be described as the social reproduction of inequality on a transnational scale, which has repercussions on the present and future class conditions of migrants. The article contributes to discussions on class conditions and mobility from a transnational frame.",

Invoking cousin fixed effects models that adjust for unobserved legacies of disadvantage that cascade across generations, we find that families where both mothers and their children are exposed to childhood neighborhood disadvantage yield reduced earnings, net of observed and unobserved confounders, for all groups except for Blacks. We theorize that discrimination and racism salient for Blacks in the labor market may dim the ability of neighborhood attainment to act as a main pathway to social and economic mobility. These results push scholars to conceptualize neighborhoods as much more durable features of inequality and refine our understanding of the uneven economic returns to neighborhood attainment across race and ethnicity.",

Using multigenerational historical survey records from the Japanese American Research Project, this study investigates the influence of premigration socioeconomic and cultural background of Japan-born grandparents and parents on the social mobility of second-generation Japanese Americans born in the continental United States in the early twentieth century. The analysis reveals the enduring effects of family premigration socioeconomic status, as indicated by occupation and education, and culture conducive to upward mobility, proxied by samurai ancestry, on second-generation Japanese Americans' educational and income levels. These effects may extend back to their nonmigrant grandparents and possibly contrast with their European second-generation immigrant counterparts, who typically experienced upward mobility regardless of their family background. The results point to the critical role of origin-country socioeconomic status and culture in immigrant social mobility research, particularly for populations whose negative reception has hindered their resource access in their new countries.",

Our quantitative findings suggest that U.S. and Pennsylvania counties are very unequal in terms of how men raised in low-income families fare in adulthood on measures of upward mobility, household income, college graduation, incarceration, and marriage. A variety of county-level measures of concentrated disadvantage were associated with these outcomes, including county household income, poverty rate, degree of racial segregation, college graduation rate, single parenthood rate, social capital rate, and job growth rate. Additionally, anonymous qualitative data from phone interviews with county commissioners from some of the Pennsylvania counties that struggled the most in our analysis helped to confirm our findings with valuable on-the-ground perspectives. We discuss these findings and their implications for equality of opportunity in the U.S. and the state of Pennsylvania.",

    "112": "Using Swedish registry data, we study the chances of mobility into the Swedish labour market elite for men who graduated in the years 19852005. The elite is defined as top earners within mid- and large sized firms and within the public sector organisations (henceforth, we use organisation for both firms and public organisations) Using discrete time event history models, we study the incidence of elite entry in terms of external recruitment and internal promotion. The choice of field of study and of college or university are important, as are personality and, to a limited extent, cognitive ability. What is most striking is that having kin in elite positions increases the chance of elite entry in general, and having parents in top positions in the same organisation increases the likelihood of internal promotion. In sum, elite entry among college-educated males is associated with a diversity of factors, suggesting that complex explanations for labour market success should be considered, where skills, personality, and family ties all seem to matter.",
    "113": "Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic propensity for educational attainment have been constructed. It is by now well established that this PGS predicts wages, income, and occupational prestige and occupational mobility across generations. It is unknown whether a PGS for educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about 53 years of age) conditional on 1974 values of these variables and a range of covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status, is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (ii) conditional on 1974 outcomes, higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with more than a high school education; (iii) throughout their employment history, high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (iv) though no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to our understanding of longitudinal inequality across careers and shed light on the sources of heterogeneity in responses to economic shocks and policy.",

This paper defines social mobility as a situation in which the relative economic status of an agent is not dependent on starting conditions such as parental income or family background. Analyzing the determinants of mobility involves exploring the channels through which offsprings income is correlated to its parents, such as inherited bequest, education, skills, among many others. This survey explores, in an analytical framework, the relation between social mobility and inequality, among other important dimensions of income distribution that are jointly determined. The focus is on the relevance of social mobility as it affects variables determining welfare and economic efficiency, and therefore on policies to promote it.",

In this paper we develop a structural model to examine the channels through which this elasticity operates. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we separately identify the human capital and the financial components. The human capital component examines the transmission of human capital, independent of financial investments while the financial component examines the impact of income that is uncorrelated with human capital, that is, exogenous income. Using a two-stage framework, we show that the intergenerational income elasticity operates through both channels. Moreover, our estimates show that the financial component may have a larger effect than previously estimated, plausibly attributing to 36 percent of intergenerational income transmission. Indeed, this result holds even when the financial component is defined in an incredibly narrow manner. This suggests that cash payments could promote intergenerational mobility.",

In addition to other influences, sprawling development patterns, dispersed job locations, and high job inaccessibility may contribute to the low rate of upward mobility in the U.S. In this study, the authors seek to test the relationship between urban sprawl and upward mobility for commuting zones in the U.S. They use structural equation modeling to account for both direct and indirect effects of sprawl on upward mobility. They find that upward mobility is significantly higher in compact areas than sprawling areas. The direct effect, which they attribute to better job accessibility in more compact commuting zones, is stronger than the indirect effects. Of the indirect effects, only one, through the mediating variable income segregation, is significant.",

The issue addressed is important because of the policy focus on income inequality in the country for the last five and a half decades, and the coverage of the data collected renders the data set used in his analysis to be the first of its kind for Malaysia. The findings from his survey indicate that educational mobility is high, with 62 percent of children being better educated than their parents. This is not surprising in view of the fact that the relatively high level of educational expenditure in Malaysia has led to significant improvements in student enrollment, resulting in almost near-universal access at the primary and lower secondary levels (Malaysia 2013) Obtaining more education does not necessarily translate to upward occupational or income mobility, You do not currently have access to this content.",

We examine the nature of dynamic fairness based on the distribution of prospects using a generalized concentration curve. We find that dynamic fairness is jointly determined by inequality and exchange mobility, with inequality reducing fairness and exchange mobility enhancing it. Moreover, any degree of dynamic fairness can be obtained from one of the many pairs of inequality and exchange mobility. Our results can help compare different economic environments through the distribution of their economic opportunities.",

    "122": "This paper presents an analysis of what types of values, especially in regards to obedience vs. independence, families impart to their children and how these values interact with social mobility. In the model, obedience is a useful characteristic for employers, especially when wages are low, because independent workers require more incentives (when wages are high, these incentives are automatic) Hence, in low-wage environments, low-income families will impart values of obedience to their children to prevent disadvantaging them in the labor market. To the extent that independence is useful for entrepreneurial activities, this then depresses their social mobility. High-income and privileged parents, on the other hand, always impart values of independence, since they expect that their children can enter into higher-income entrepreneurial (or managerial) activities thanks to their family resources and privileges. I also discuss how political activity can be hampered when labor market incentives encourage greater obedience and how this can generate multiple steady states with different patterns of social hierarchy and mobility.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

Using a rich dataset on income and consumption of Indian households, we estimate the distributional effects of such interventions in a heterogeneous agent model. The standard scheme of interventions that consistently targets lower-income cohorts, has muted distributional impacts. However, a fiscally-equivalent scheme that changes the expected income profile of the targeted households in the same initial cohort irrespective of their future incomes, generates substantially larger effects by changing their income mobility. Quantitatively, such an intervention in the order of 0.6 percent of the output, approximating the Indian scenario, increases consumption share of the targeted group by nearly 2.5 percent, five times as large as the effect of standard interventions. As the intervention becomes larger in magnitude and scope, as is empirically observed in other developing countries, this intensive margin effect becomes stronger along with the extensive margin.",
    "124": "Upward mobility is possible to an immigrant group if the institutions of the host society are open to social change and the immigrants culture encourages social mobility. The Author tests his assumption by analyzing the Census statistics of 1950 and 1960 for the New York metropolis concerning Puerto Ricans. The conclusion is that in New York between 1950 and 1960 the children of Puerto Rican migrants, at least, were upwardly mobile: they attained some high school education, certain white collar jobs, and, to a lesser extent, higher income. Puerto Rican parents, however, are stil poor, and so are their childen. But if the experience of the decade studied can be a basis for prediction, the possibility of achieving a social class distribution similar to that of other groups in the city is very real for the Puerto Rican migrants in their own remaining life spans and those of their children.

Reference group theory suggests that culturally shaped processes alter individuals' ambition. As a result, relative deprivation e ects may discourage (encourage) low-background individuals from making adequate mobility-enhancing investments. The model con rms that reference groups could be an inequality transmission mechanism across generations, and shows that both the size and direction of this e ect depends on, (a) the composition of the reference group, (b) the intensity and functional form of income comparisons, (c) the ex-ante inequality between agents from di erent social origins and the reward of e ort, and (d) the information about their peers and past income mobility.

    "127": "The acceptance of income differences varies across countries. This article suggests three general mechanisms to account for this: the tunnel effect, related to perceptions of generational mobility; the procedural justice effect, related to the perceived fairness in the process of getting ahead; and the middle-class effect, related to perceptions of the current social structure. The suggested mechanisms are tested by means of the ISSP 2009 module, which includes 38 countries. The three mechanisms account for a considerable part of the cross-national differences. The relatively high tolerance for current income differences in countries such as Denmark, Norway and China, and low tolerance in countries such as Ukraine, Hungary and Bulgaria, are well explained by the theoretical framework. By means of model residuals it is also shown which countries should be considered exceptional. Finally, as in previous research, no link was found between actual income inequality and acceptance of current income differences.",

We show in this paper that the average credit scores are robustly correlated with EC, negatively correlated with the friending-bias measure introduced in Chetty et al. (2022b) and predict economic mobility to a comparable extent after controlling for EC. The consistency and complementarity between these two indicators, despite being derived from individuals' activities in distinct contexts, underscore trust as a crucial component of social capital and provide insights that are useful for understanding the formation and accumulation of social capital.",

In the context of a non-overlapping generations growth model with high-skilled and low-skilled employees, we argue that a potential explanation for this result is that growth policies ignore the importance of income redistribution. Even though reforms enhance economic growth, most of their benefits might be transferred to high-skilled individuals. Their low-skilled counterparts gains from economic growth are instead low and therefore this group remains sensitive to income transfers. If the latter are not provided, the reformist regimes likelihood to survive in power declines, even though its policies results in higher growth rates. We also show that a policy which enhances social mobility, thus helping low-skilled individuals to transit to the high-skilled group, can be a long-run substitute for income redistribution, but can not replace the latter in the short term.",

Using data from the Labour Force Survey (20142023) which contains detailed information on parental class and respondents socio-economic conditions, we examine four domains of life chances which are crucial for ethnic integration: educational attainment at the degree level, risks of unemployment, access to professional-managerial (salariat) position and earning power. We proceeded with the gross differences and then examined the differences by ethno-gender status and parental class combinations, controlling for many confounding factors. We also examined the net ethno-gender differences over the life course and the trends of social fluidity over the period covered and across the ethno-gender groups. We found that women from all ethnic origins were doing well in education but faced multiple disadvantages in the labour market, especially in access to the salariat and in earning power. Women of Pakistani/Bangladeshi heritages faced pronounced unemployment risks, especially at the earlier life stages. There is a significant increase in fluidity over the period covered, but this is marked by considerable ethnic and class differences, with Black Caribbean, Black African, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women from more advantaged class origins being unable to secure advantaged class positions and those from working-class families unable to make long-range upward mobility as effectively as White men. Overall, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Black African and Black Caribbean women are found to be considerably disadvantaged, but there are also signs of social progress.",

This finding puts into doubt the main argument of the mainstream academic and political discourse over the prominent role of education for income acquisition. Instead, this paper stresses the importance of other factors explainingincome attainments, such as social interconnectivity. The latter can produce or reproduce inequality as long as people gain accessto powerful positions through the usage of social connections. Thus, the upper social classes with extended social networking preserve their social privileges across generations despite the argument that the contemporary society boasts high social mobility attained through formal education.",

Particular ethnic groups, such as Iranians and Yemenis, have accomplished higher educational levels than both whites and blacks, yet unemployment rates are amongst the highest of all. Upward mobility from their first-generation parents is achieved as well. By ethnic group, Egyptian individuals prove to have outpaced their MENA peers on multiple measurements, however not on all. Several ethnic groups stand out in these measurements of socioeconomic status.",

The best is the National Child Development Survey, which has analyzed all the children born in a single week in 1958 at various points in their lives. In \"Two Nations? The Inheritance of Poverty and Affluence,\" the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, analyzed this data. It found that by 1991, 34% of those in the highest income quintile had fathers who were also in the top income group; 11% however, had fathers in the poorest quintile. In a society with full equality of opportunity, and ability distributed equally across the population, 20% of the richest quintile would have had fathers from the richest quintile, and 20% from the poorest. This suggests that opportunity is dispersed in Britain, but not fully equalized. But what if ability is not in fact distributed equally amongst the population? This question is explored, using the same data as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in \"Unequal but Fair?\" a pamphlet by Peters Saunders, a sociologist at Sussex University, published last month by the Institute of Economic Affairs. He concludes that ability is greater at the top of the class/income pile than at the bottom, and that individual ability plays a crucial part in deciding where an individual will end up. Ability alone is well over twice as important as their class origins, three times more powerful than the degree of interest their parents showed in their schooling, and five times more powerful than their parents' level of education or the aspirations which their parents harbored for them while they were growing up.",
    "135": "Wealth is a central determinant of life chances and intergenerational status persistence in modern societies. Despite increasing attention, sociologists traditionally overlooked its role in class-based economic disparities, while most economists focused on the elites accumulation. This article combines sociological and economic perspectives to test whether big occupational classes, the most standardised and operationalisable approach, depict the wealth distribution. Drawing from the Luxembourg Wealth Study (20022018) in five European countries, we explore (1) how wealth is distributed and stratified by big occupational classes over time and cross-nationally and (2) to what extent classes account for aggregate wealth inequality trends compared with income. Unlike bold claims on class 'death' or 'decomposition' inequality of outcomes in wealth accumulation is firmly rooted across big occupational classes in contemporary capitalism, potentially harming social mobility in future generations. Still, occupational classes better capture between-group income inequality and stratification than wealth, emphasising the importance of economic resources beyond labour market attachment. Against the backdrop of previous research and our findings, we discuss the role of wealth in contemporary class analysis.",

    "137": "Class structure and class formation are two crucial aspects of class. The former relates to differences in market positions and the latter concerns social factors such as interaction, mobility and class action. This paper is based on Swedish data covering the period from 1975 to 1995. Analysis reveals a persistent class hierarchy and that there is no trend towards declining class differences regarding market position. The situation is better described as being in a state of non-linear flux. However, one persistent trend is discernible; class explains less and less of the variance in wage income. Looking at class formation there is a decline over time in class-homogeneity. Most Swedes are mobile in the sense that they end up in a class position different from their father's. A growing majority of all marriage is also class mixed. However, although classes generally lack homogeneity, social boundaries still exist, i.e. tendencies for immobility and class homogeneous marriage. In relation to the class-is-dying hypothesis, the results generally indicate the continuing relevance of class, although the view of classes as homogenous social groups is increasingly troublesome over time.",
    "138": "An analysis of the Class Background Registers of Yanshan county, Hebei, shows that households of landlord and rich peasant status accounted for less than 10 percent of the local population and possessed less than 15 percent of the land, while households of poor and lower-middle peasant standing owned about half of the land. Overall, land distribution was relatively balanced, as seen in the Gini coefficient of 0.30.4 in the distribution of land rights and the fact that about half of the households owned 25 mu of land per capita. But the economic condition of the rural population was not determined by the factor of land distribution alone; in places where the natural endowment was poor, off-farm income-making activities mattered a great deal to local residents. Such activities took various forms, which could improve as well as worsen peoples livelihood. An analysis of social mobility in this area further shows the perpetuation of the existing class structure. Those whose grandparents had lived in poverty found it difficult to move up socially. On the whole, the rural area under study shows a prolonged trend of deterioration, which is meaningful for understanding the land reform.",
    "139": "South Africa has achieved major poverty reductions in the post-Apartheid era, but substantial variations in progress between population groups have been documented, and inequalities between poor Black communities and other parts of South Africa persist. Similarly, life chances and inter-generational mobility vary with proximal early life economic environments. The long-term interrelationships of different aspects of these environments are not well understood. Using prospective data from the Birth to Thirty (Bt30) cohort, we assess the relative importance of early life family and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) for later life educational attainment and criminality among Black children from low-income communities in Soweto-Johannesburg, South Africa. We follow a multi-step nonparametric adjusted regression approach to reduce assumptions about the nature of the relationships between outcomes and exposure variables, and we express interactions as nonlinear marginal effects. Our study finds that both childhood home SES and neighborhood SES are predictive of more favorable outcomes later in life. Home SES appears generally more predictive of young adulthood outcomes than neighborhood SES, particularly for educational outcomes. Girls fare substantially better both in terms of educational attainment and in terms of lower criminal engagement. These pro-female gaps appear to be particularly large in higher SES homes for educational attainment. Our findings highlight the critical importance of children's home environments in general, and particularly for children's educational attainment. Further support for programs to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in the current adult population can likely contribute substantially to reducing inequalities in future generations.",
    "140": "EBS 1, 2 This study aims to analyze how education policy programs aimed at easing inequality have affected upward social mobility among generations. For this purpose, the analysis steps were divided into entering the higher education and entering the labor market, and the following research problems were established. Does the policy of eliminating educational gaps in higher education contribute to upward social mobility between generations?To look at the effects of the education policies implemented to alleviate this, the university was required to analyze the social probabilities of the Korean education employment panel (KEEP) collected from 2004 to 2015 and recorded the achievements of secondary education and higher education and labor market. Education outcomes at different times of college and entering the labor market were set as subordinate variables, but they also failed to identify large and clear policy effects for those classes, considering that the main target population of the policy toward de-education is ultimately economic. In other words, we could see that the policy of eliminating the educational gap contributed to equal economic opportunities such as equality of educational opportunities and income through college entrance opportunities. To solve the problem of educational inequality without changing social order only through educational policy, the essence of social problems becomes blurred, rather, the political slogan and marketing that make it more important to treat the causes of inequality as individual ability. Furthermore, the education policy under socioeconomic inequality should be designed to find the inherent meaning of students' education processes, and as a tool, inequality in social status acquisition should be resolved to other socioeconomic policies.",
    "141": "Author(s): Carrera Galleguillos, Felipe Bersalo | Advisor(s): Board, Simon A | : Compared to other disciplines, one of the distinctive features of Economics is the impossibility of doing experiments to study empirically relevant questions. In this dissertation, I use two episodes from the past where the unique features of the institutional environment created quasi-experiments that help us understand relevant issues relate to cartels and neighborhood effects. In the fist two chapters, I use the Chilean nitrate industry between the War of the Pacific and the start of the First World War (1880-1914) to shed light on the effects of entry for cartels and the importance of learning for effective cartel organization. The Chilean nitrate industry was very important at the time: Chilean nitrate was the main commercial fertilizer used in the world. Also, it was the main industry of Chile, the only country where it is found, where it represented 70% of exports and 45% of government revenues. Importantly, there was no antitrust legislation and no domestic consumer surplus to protect in Chile. Thus, cartels could be freely formed by nitrate producers. Moreover, these cartels were completely public: Their decisions were publicly discussed by the press and the public and they would be formed by the signature of a public contract. I collected from handwritten archival records an original data set of monthly output and inputs that covers 35 years of this industry, period over which 5 cartels were organized. In the third chapter, I introduce a novel new dataset to study neighborhood effects that uses a massive program of forced-displacement of population within the city of Santiago in the context of the Chilean dictatorship in the early 1980s. Chapter 1 studies the effect of cartels on entry, and the long-term effect of cartel-induced entry for the evolution of industry productivity. Intuitively, as cartels artificially increase prices entry becomes more attractive and less productive firms may decide to enter. Because of data limitations, previous researchers have not quantified the extensive margin mechanism. My analysis has 3 steps. First, I evaluate if nitrate cartels caused more entry of new firms. I find that cartels generated an additional entry of 4 plants per year or about 5\\% of the initial number of plants in my main period of interest. Second, I estimate the productivity of all the plants in the industry to analyze if firms that entered during cartel periods where less productive. I find that there is a sizable gap in average productivity between entrants during competition and cartel periods: If the median-sized plant in the industry had received this productivity gap its revenue would have increases by one-third. Third, I conduct two counterfactual simulations. The first, studies the effect of entry on cartel profits by estimating incumbent cartel members counterfactual profits if they had been able to prevent any additional entry. I find their counterfactual profits would have been 40% larger had there been no entry. The second counterfactual studies the effect of having a cartel on entry. Specifically, what would the number of new firms and their productivity have been, if during the Fourth and Fifth Cartels there had been competition? I find that 18% of the plants that entered in the data would have not entered. This translates into an increase on mean plant productivity of 3%.Chapter 2 studies the degree to which experience helps firms to organize successful cartels. Unlike in most of the previous literature on cartels, in the nitrate cartels issues related to monitoring and enforcement were of secondary importance with respect to the challenge of allocating the collusive surplus among the colluding firms. I document that cartel contracts gradually became more complete, generated a smoother transition from competition to collusion, and that producers eventually discarded inefficient methods of market share allocation, associated to larger production costs, in favor of better alternatives. In particular, I am able to estimate that the time method used during the Second Cartel directly caused higher production costs of about 10% while the trial method implemented during the Third Cartel caused higher costs of approximately 20% Finally, Chapter 3 describes a novel large dataset that combines archival records and administrative data to study a natural experiment that occurred during the Chilean dictatorship between 1979 and 1985, when the government mandated the relocation of a large number of slums in the city of Santiago, Chile. Some features of the program's implementation make it of unique interest to study the broad effects of neighborhoods on social mobility and inequality: the unit of treatment was the slum, participation was mandatory and compliance was very high, since the policy was implemented during a highly repressive dictatorial government. In addition, and only some of the slums were removed from their original location creating two groups of families: movers and non-movers, which allows me to identify a causal displacement effect. The dataset comprises data for more than 26,000 households that were part of this program (out of a total of 40,000 households) and more than 58,000 of their children, providing the potential for causal estimation of the long-term and inter-generational effects of moving to a high-poverty neighborhood on education, mortality, income, and crime.",

The results show relatively high income mobility for Brazilian standards.

Elasticity estimates are larger using two-digit level occupations and two-sampleapproach than the estimates using one-digit occupations and one-sample approach,respectively, and earnings volatility has substantial effects on elasticities.

    "145": "WE'VE all read about what we might call the gold -- how the rich in this country are getting richer and controlling an ever-larger share of the nation's wealth. Now comes the Century Foundation with Reality Check, a series of guides to campaign issues that sometimes finds gaps in our cherished delusions. For instance, one of the four guides so far in the series is called Rags to Riches? It is subtitled American Dream Is Less Common in the United States Than Elsewhere. And it doesn't exactly pull punches: How easy is it for the children of poor parents to become prosperous? Recent evidence shows that there is much less mobility in the United States than most people assume. Horatio Alger notwithstanding, rags to rags and riches to riches are now the norm in this country to a greater degree than in many other developed nations. Our current education system, antidiscrimination laws, and other public policy tools that aim to give the children of poor parents a fair shot at a high income are not getting the job done. Fortunately, the data used to support this claim are not as strong as the rhetoric. The first graph brought to bear takes the children born to the poorest 20% of Americans and shows where they ended up on the poverty scale as adults. More than 40% ended up with their parents in the poorest 20% Another 25% made it into the next quintile. And about 7% reached the top quintile. It is hard to judge how the graph bears on the current reality because the study from which the figures come tracked 3,000 people from 1942 to 1972. That's quite an effort, but, obviously, conditions from 1972 to 2002 would have been quite a bit different than from 1942 to 1972. Looking at the correlation between fathers' and sons' incomes, the more years that go into the average used in the correlation, the stronger the correlation. That is, if three years of income are used to compute the average, the correlation is low (about .30) while if 15 years are used, the correlation is much stronger (about .60) Still, a correlation of .60 leaves 64% of the variance unaccounted for (the square of the correlation is the amount of variance accounted for) Perhaps the strongest data on income mobility come from studies of father/son income correlations in other countries. While different studies produce different figures (because they use different data and different periods of time) only England and South Africa had a larger correlation between the incomes of fathers and sons than the U.S. A total of eight studies in Germany, Finland, Sweden, and Canada all showed lower correlations. Of course, these lower correlations cut both ways. While they indicate that poor children in, say, Finland are more likely to outstrip their fathers, they also indicate that rich children in Finland are more likely to fall into poverty (insofar as it is possible to fall into poverty in countries with strong social safety nets) Other booklets out so far in the series are Left Behind: Unequal Opportunity in Higher Education, Turning Gold into Straw: How Huge Federal Surpluses Quickly Become Equally Massive Deficits, and Why It's Good to Be Rich -- and Getting Better All the Time. Parsing the Academic Achievement Gap How many times can something be discovered? When it comes to the achievement gap between white and Asian students on the one hand and black and Hispanic students on the other, the apparent answer is infinitely until the end of time. Paul Barton at least takes us a little way toward doing something about the through what he calls parsing -- looking for differences in variables that matter. This is not an original piece of research. It might be thought of as an informal meta-meta-analysis, and Barton looked, wherever possible, to find areas where the research had already been synthesized by one or more researchers.

It explains the income and wealth positions of Pakistanis from different generations in terms of their endowments of social, human, and physical capital and other socioeconomic characteristics. 1200 respondents from 10 major city districts were interviewed in 1982. The analysis of correlations between the absolute level of income and wealth vis-a-vis the fathers' and sons' characteristics has shown that the improvement in the economic position of sons follows a more stable and coherent pattern than the improvement in fathers' economic position. The analysis of the magnitudes of mobility indicators shows that the dispersion of accumulated wealth is considerably higher than that of income among individual sons. The analysis of correlations between the wealth and the income indicators vis-a-vis fathers' and sons' characteristics shows that fathers' labor characteristics, in particular--their occupations, work status, and education--provide significant and coherent patterns for improvement of economic positions of sons. Wealth mobility by places of origin and residence is sensitive to influx of migrants' fathers for India. The analysis of incidences of upward wealth and income mobility by working status and occupations has shown that the results are sensitive to the transition process between fathers and sons in the labor market, from non-wage to wage employment, and from low paying and less skilled jobs to more skilled and better paying ones.",
    "148": "Intergenerational disparity in income and health violates the norm of equal opportunity and deserves the attention of researchers and policy makers. To understand changes in intergenerational disparity, we created the intergenerational mobility index (IMI) which can simultaneously measure changes in income rankings and in health outcomes across two generations. We selected obesity as one health outcome to illustrate the application of IMI due to its severe health and financial consequences for society and the significant changes in the distribution of obesity across income groups. Although obesity has increased in all income groups in the last four decades, higher income groups have tended to have a faster increase in obesity, which has reduced the disparity in obesity across income groups. The strength of our intergenerational approach within families is to control the genetic influence, which is one of the strongest determinants of obesity. The decomposition of the IMI illustrates that it captures changes in obesity distribution (holding constant income rankings between generations) and changes in income rankings (holding constant the obesity distribution across generations) simultaneously. We used the data of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) which have been collected since 1967, is the longest longitudinal survey in the U.S. The PSID surveyed respondents height and weight were recorded in 1986 and from 1999 to 2007. We selected respondents from 1986 as the parental generation and respondents from 2007 as the adult childrens generation. To make the adult childrens body weight status and income comparable to their parents, we stratified the analysis by gender. For the pairs of fathers and adult sons, we found the intergenerational disparity in overweight, a less severe indicator of excessive fatness, across income was decreasing. This was partially due to the up-swing in the adult childrens income status. For the pairs of mothers and adult daughters, we found a similar decrease in socioeconomic disparity in obesity. However, decomposition of the IMI indicated that changes in income distributions between mothers and adult daughters contributed smaller effects than that between fathers and adult sons. Our study has demonstrated that the IMI and its decomposition are useful tools for analyzing intergenerational disparity in income and health.",
    "149": "Previous research on changes in intergenerational mobility suggests that mobility is decreasing over time. One explanation for this pattern is increased cross-sectional income inequality. In contrast to most other OECD countries, income inequality in Norway has been remarkably stable through large parts of the 1980s and the 1990s, not least due to a compression of the earnings distribution during the same period. Using longitudinal data for Norwegian children born in 1950, 1955, 1960, and 1965, we find a relatively high degree of earnings mobility. Furthermore, there is no tendency to increasing inequality along this dimension. This finding supports the hypothesis that intergenerational mobility is positively correlated with a compressed income distribution. Quartile father-child earnings transition matrices, together with non-parametric regressions, indicate quite high mobility in the middle of the distribution and somewhat more persistence at the top and bottom. This approach also reveals increased mobility over time for sons, but a less clear picture for daughters.",

The intergenerational transition matrices corroborate these results, indicating that much of the intergenerational income immobility is due to from what occurs in the tails of the income distribution. The results do not confirm the traditional social role pattems in Germany and a higher social mobility of the American society.",

While a majority of Americans exceed their parents family income and wealth, the extent of their absolute mobility gains are not always enough to move them to a different rung of the economic ladder. Measuring both absolute and relative mobility, some of the highlights of the research include: Eighty-four percent of Americans have higher family incomes than their parents did. However, those born at the top and bottom of the income ladder are likely to stay there as adults. Over 40 percent of Americans raised in the bottom quintile of the family income ladder remain stuck there adults, and 70 percent remain below the middle. African Americans are still less likely to exceed their parents income than are whites and they are more likely to be stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder across a generation.

    "154": "Numerous public policies are aimed at improving the earnings opportunities for children of the poor and at reducing lifetime earnings inequality. This paper investigates to what extent such policies accomplish their objectives. A quantitative theory of intergenerational mobility and lifetime earnings inequality is developed and parameterized to match selected features of U.S. data. Numerical experiments are used to measure the steady state effects of policies that increase the returns to human capital accumulation for children of the poor, either by lowering the private costs of education or by reducing labor income taxes for the poor. The main finding is that such policies have very little impact on intergenerational earnings mobility. Moreover, policies that reduce the private costs of education fail to reduce lifetime earnings inequality. These findings suggest that redistributive tax and subsidy policies of the kind studied here are largely ineffective in promoting \"equality of opportunity.\"",
    "155": "Money parents give their adult children may be important for the financing of a child's education or a first home, relaxing binding credit constraints or responding to a transitory income shock. Financial transfers however, may extend economic disparities across generations if the wealthy transfer considerable resources to their children while middle class and poor households do not. In this paper, the authors first examine annual gifts of money from parents to adult children in the United States and ten European countries using the 2004 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) Second, utilizing the long panel of the HRS, the authors study the long-run behavior of parental monetary giving to children across families and within a family. This paper found that in all countries, some parents gave money to children, many did not, the amount was low, about 500 Euros annually per child, and varied by parental socio-economic status and public social expenditures. In the short-term parents in the U.S. gave money to a child to compensate for low earnings or satisfy an immediate need such as schooling. Over sixteen years, parents gave an average of about $38,000 to all their children, five percent gave over $140,000 and gave persistently. With time, the amount of money children in the same family received became more equal and a child's level of education was one of the few remaining sources of differences in money given to children. Overall, the annual amount of money parents gave adult children in any country was not enough to affect the distribution of resources within or between families in the next generation although the timing of transfers for schooling or housing may have a significant impact on an individual child. Annual parental transfers for college age children in school in the U.S. were substantially higher than average transfers to all children. The effect of parental transfers for higher education on intergenerational mobility in the U.S. will depend in part upon whether this financing is essential in the schooling decision.",

If family background is important in getting ahead, why? And if processes that transmit economic status from parent to child are unfair, could public policy address problem? Unequal Chances provides new answers to these questions by leading economists, sociologists, biologists, behavioral geneticists, and philosophers. New estimates show that intergenerational inequality in United States is far greater than was previously thought. Moreover, while inheritance of wealth and better schooling typically enjoyed by children of well-to-do contribute to this process, these two standard explanations fail to explain extent of intergenerational status transmission. The genetic inheritance of IQ is even less important. Instead, parent-offspring similarities in personality and behavior may play an important role. Race contributes to process, and intergenerational mobility patterns of African Americans and European Americans differ substantially.",
    "157": "We propose an alternative method for measuring intergenerational mobility. Measurements obtained from traditional methods (based on panel data) are scarce, difficult to compare across countries and almost impossible to get across time. In particular, this means that we do not know how intergenerational mobility is correlated with growth, income or the degree of inequality. Our proposal is to measure the informative content of surnames in one census. The more information the surname has on the income of an individual, the more important is her background in determining her outcomes; and thus, the less mobility there is. The reason is that surnames provide information about family relationships because the distribution of surnames is necessarily very skewed. A large percentage of the population is bound to have a very unfrequent surname. For them the partition generated by surnames is very informative on family linkages. First, we develop a model whose endogenous variable is the joint distribution of surnames and income. There, we explore the relationship between mobility and the informative content of surnames. We allow for assortative mating to be a determinant of both. Second, we use our methodology to show that in large Spanish region the informative content of surnames is large and consistent with the model. We also show that it has increased over time, indicating a substantial drop in the degree of mobility. Finally, using the peculiarities of the Spanish surname convention we show that the degree of assortative mating has also increased over time, in such a manner that might explain the decrease in mobility observed. Our method allows us to provide measures of mobility comparable across time. It should also allow us to study other issues related to inheritance.",

This relationship is interpreted as a measure of intergenerational social mobility, and the paper reports evidence that it has decreased over time.

As a result, the improvements in education of the 1980s and 1990s were unevenly distributed, with a bias against the disadvantaged. The paper also finds that while entrepreneurship status and belonging to the middle class matter in terms of social mobility as measured by compulsory education, i. e. primary school and the first three years of secondary school, they do not have a notable effect on non- compulsory education, i. e. the last three years of secondary school and higher.",

    "160": "A conviction for drug possession blocks some of the most common pathways through which individuals from low income families achieve upward economic mobility in the United States, such as access to higher education, entrylevel employment, and military service. These considerations are of growing importance because the number of drugrelated arrests have nearly quadrupled since 1980. This article estimates the effect of a conviction for drug possession on earnings mobility using a sample of individuals born between 1980 and 1984, some of the first cohorts to come of age in the context of intensive U.S. drug criminalization and enforcement. To distinguish the effect of a drug conviction from the effect of drug use or general criminality, I compare mobility among individuals with drug convictions to control groups who selfreport significant drug use and who have had interactions with the criminal justice system that did not lead to a drug conviction. I find that relative to these groups, a drug conviction reduces the probability of transitioning upward from various points in the lower half of the income distribution by 1015 percentage points, or as much as 50% and that these effects are substantially stronger for nonwhites than for whites. These findings suggest that a policy of decriminalizing nonviolent drug possession would substantially increase intergenerational mobility among low income populations, and this effect should be weighed alongside more conventional costs and benefits in formulating optimal drug policy.

This dramatically changed the consensus view of the U.S. as a highly mobile society. In this comment, I show both analytically and empirically how Solon and others have actually underestimated this parameter by about 30 percent, suggesting that the IGE is actually close to 0.6 and that the U.S. appears to be among the least mobile countries. There are two key measurement issues that lead researchers to underestimate the IGE. First, the use of short-term averages of fathers' earnings is a poor proxy for lifetime economic status due to highly persistent transitory shocks. Second, the variance of transitory fluctuations to earnings varies considerably by age causing a \"lifecycle\" bias when samples include measures of fathers' earnings when they are especially young or old. In this comment Solon's results are replicated and then re-estimated using a new technique that is able to address these issues using the same PSID sample. The results confirm that the IGE is likely to be around 0.6.",
    "164": "Social mobility has become a topic of central political concern. In political and also media circles it is widely believed that in Britain today mobility is in decline. However, this belief appears to be based on a single piece of research by economists that is in fact concerned with intergenerational income mobility: specifically, with the relation between family income and children's later earnings. Research by sociologists using the same data sources--the British birth cohort studies of 1958 and 1970--but focusing on intergenerational class mobility does not reveal a decline either in total mobility rates or in underlying relative rates. The paper investigates these divergent findings. We show that they do not result from the use of different subsets of the data or of different analytical techniques. Instead, given the more stable and generally less fluid class mobility regime, it is the high level of income mobility of the 1958 cohort, rather than the lower level of the 1970 cohort, that is chiefly in need of explanation. Further analyses--including ones of the relative influence of parental class and of family income on children's educational attainment--suggest that the economists' finding of declining mobility between the two cohorts may stem, in part at least, from the fact that the family income variable for the 1958 cohort provides a less adequate measure of 'permanent income' than does that for the 1970 cohort. But, in any event, it would appear that the class mobility regime more fully captures the continuity in economic advantage and disadvantage that persists across generations.",

As there is no adequate data on fathers, I revert to information from a period that differs from actual fathers' work period. This methodological approach leads to a bias of the resulting IGE. Nevertheless, cross-national comparison of income mobility is still possible. A comparison across subgroups of the Swiss population shows strong differences between Swiss and immigrants. Compared to natives, immigrants are more immobile. Also, substantial heterogeneity is found across different ethnic groups. Using quantile regression, mobility for natives is found to be similar for all income quantiles. Among immigrants, mobility is higher at the lower as well as at the upper end of the income distribution. These patterns differ from previous results from other countries.",

This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the meritocratic power of a college degree. Drawing on five longitudinal data sets, the author analyzes intergenerational mobility in terms of class, occupational status, earnings, and household income for men and women. Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelors degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelors degree alone.",

We find that there is considerable intergenerational income mobility in Canada among middle income earners, but that the inheritance of economic status is significant at both the very top and very bottom of the income distribution. About one-third of those in the bottom quartile were raised by fathers who occupied the same position in the income distribution. In fact, the income advantage of someone who had a father in the top decile over someone who had a father in the bottom decile is in the order of 40% We also discuss some of the policy implications of these findings, as well as some of their limitations and the directions implied for future research.",

    "169": "We analyze how the introduction of habits and aspirations affects the distribution of wealth when the labor productivity of individuals is subject to idiosyncratic shocks and when bequests arise from a joyofgiving motive. In the presence of either bequests or aspirations, labor income shocks are transmitted intergenerationally, and this transmission, together with contemporaneous shocks, determines the distribution of wealth. We show that the introduction of aspirations (habits) decreases (increases) the average wealth, and increases (decreases) both its intragenerational variability and the degree of intergenerational mobility. Therefore, a distinction between aspirations and habits is relevant because they involve different implications for the distribution of wealth.",
    "170": "We study the role of parental wealth for children's educational and occupational outcomes across three types of welfare states and outline a theoretical model that assumes parental wealth to impact offspring's attainment through two mechanisms, wealth's purchasing function and its insurance function. We argue that welfare states can limit the purchasing function of wealth, for instance by providing free education and generous social benefits, yet none of the welfare states examined here provides a functional equivalent to the insurance against adverse outcomes afforded by parental wealth. Our empirical evidence of substantial associations between parental wealth and children's educational success and social mobility in three nations that are marked by large institutional differences is in line with this interpretation and helps us re-examine and extend existing typologies of mobility regimes.",

    "172": "This paper proposes a unified framework for the analysis of inequalities. In contrast to the former literature on inequalities, housing is included as a major determinant of individual saving behavior. Disparities across locations affect individual outcomes in both labor and education markets. In a Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari type model where several frictions are represented, the model allows for segmentation between homeowners and renters in the housing market, imperfection in the capital market and residential mobility over the life-cycle. Moreover, individual location is assumed to affect labor productivity, wealth accumulation via the dynamics of housing prices and the human capital acquisition process of the next generation. The dynamics of prices combined to bequest motive provide the perfect framework to understand the tenure choice of individuals. Furthermore, the fixity of housing supply in each neighborhood combined with borrowing constraints prevent some households from living in their preferred area, which leads to segregation. Using this general framework, the paper contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between labor, housing and education markets. Finally, several experiments aimed at decreasing the level of inequalities at the individual and location level are provided.",

The political economy of intergenerational income mobility in Singapore This study used the Singapore National Youth Surveys of 2002 and 2010 to measure the intergenerational dependence of youths' income on their parents' income. The pooled estimate of 0.24 gave a scaled value of 0.44, which when compared internationally indicates an economy with moderately low intergenerational income mobility. The findings analysed against Singapore's political economy suggest that the 2009 recession, a widened safety net and immigration might have mitigated the negative effects that a developmental welfare state and rising inequality have on intergenerational mobility. The effects of Singapore's differentiated education system were unclear. However, despite the limitations in data and data availability in Asia, the findings provide useful points of departure for other countries. The findings also indicate the need for more extensive data and research on what effects the current economic and policy trends have on mobility.",

It uses data from the Korea Labor and Income Panel Study and the Household Income and Expenditure Survey conducted by the Korean National Statistics Bureau. Since no single Korean dataset includes information on both sons and their fathers adult earnings, this study follows the two-sample approach previously applied in Korea by Ueda (J Asian Econ 122, 2013) whose estimated intergenerational earnings elasticity is 0.22, and extends the analysis by using fathers earnings from a more approximal cohort.

    "175": "This paper studies the stationary distribution of wealth by using a basic economic model encompassing saving, investment, occupational choice, an imperfect credit market, entrepreneurial abilities, and intergenerational wealth mobilities. It implies that persistent wealth inequality depends on the probability of intergenerational upward mobility relative to the downward mobility probability. The model predicts substitutability between the probabilities that workers' children and entrepreneurs' children have sufficient wealth to become entrepreneurs in achieving the same degree of persistent wealth inequality. It also implies workers' children can have sufficient entrepreneurial wealth with greater or less probability than entrepreneurs' children depending on an explicit mobility measure. A wealth variant of the Great Gatsby Curve is shown to require a restriction on the downward mobility probability. The model also shows that the two kinds of entrepreneurial skills (endowed and environmental-historical abilities) are net substitutes rather than complements in preserving a given measure of stationary wealth inequality. Conditions are given on environmental-historical and endowed abilities that allow different probabilities of passing the wealth test for different types of agents, though no structural relationship between them was built into the model. We obtain insights into how the interest rate affects mobility probabilities and persistent inequality. Finally, the model is solved to obtain a closed Beta form for the distribution of wealth. Its shape is given by the mobility probabilities and subsumes the Pareto wealth distribution as a special case. Empirical illustrations inclue comparisons of the quantile estimates of our Beta stationary wealth density with the generalized Pareto distribution.",

The article tests the hypothesis that the impact of family-background characteristics on labor supply decisions, sex or gender segregation, and intergenerational transmission of social and economic status is more expressed in societies with traditional role patterns. Using data from the international version of the Cross-National Equivalent File (PSIDGSOEP) the results of the static labor supply model show that gender and education significantly determine the individual labor market participation in both the countries. Occupational gender segregation is more pronounced in Germany than in the United States. The contribution of the occupational groups to total gender segregation differs by country but not by marital status. We find stronger evidence for the impact of individual- and family-background characteristics on the intergenerational heritage of social status in the United States than in Germany.",

We find that, conditional on permanent income, education is maximized when income is balanced between the early childhood and middle childhood years. In addition, there is an advantage to having Income occur in late adolescence rather than in early childhood. These result are consistent with a model of parental investments in children with multiple periods of childhood, income shocks, imperfect insurance, dynamic complementarity, and uncertainty about the production function and the ability of the child.",
    "180": "There is growing concern over income inequality and its generational dimensions. Post F ordist and neoliberal restructuring have reshaped urban labour markets, resulting in growing inequalities that disproportionately afflict younger workers. This article empirically analyses the transition as experienced in M ontreal and V ancouver, two C anadian cities that have undergone restructuring in different ways. The study of young adults' changing incomes reveals growing intra and intercohort inequality, and an increasing intergenerational income gap in both cities. Income inequality is greater in V ancouver, with its more pronounced post F ordist labour force composition and neoliberalized governance context. Known factors such as occupation and gender affect the earnings structure, but educational attainment has increased the most in terms of its effect on incomes. Inequalities among young adults are expected to magnify in the future due to unevenness in educational attainment. Urban research ought to pay close attention to the role of education in structuring inequalities, and the ways the impact of restructuring is unevenly distributed across generations.",
    "181": "It is widely believed that countries with greater levels of income inequality also have lower levels of intergenerational mobility. This relationship, known as the Great Gatsby Curve (GGC) has been prominently cited by high-ranking public policymakers, bestselling authors, and Nobel Prizewinning academics. Yet, relatively little cross-national work has empirically examined the mechanisms thought to underpin the GGCparticularly with regard to the role of educational attainment. This paper uses the cross-nationally comparable Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data set to shed new light on this issue. We find that income inequality is associated with several key components of the intergenerational transmission processincluding access to higher education, the financial returns on education, and the residual effect of parental education upon labor-market earnings. Thus, consistent with theoretical models, we find that educational attainment is an important driver of the relationship between intergenerational mobility and income inequality. We hence conclude that unequal access to financial resources plays a central role in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.",

This paper discusses how incentives and information problems combined with the material features of agriculture affect the existence and nature of rural credit markets and how credit market problems are manifested in other factor markets. By focusing on the interrelationships among debt, wealth, borrowing and lending behavior, it derives implications for efficiency and intergenerational mobility. The paper uses longitudinal survey data from three villages in the semi-arid tropical region of India to estimate econometrically the interrelationships between a household's current asset position and the probabilities of the household receiving a loan from formal, informal, public and private credit sources. The empirical results indicate that the amount and the form of a household's assets are important determinants of the probability of receiving credit. The paper's results also indicate that education and inherited wealth account for substantial differences in both debt and wealth accumulation. These findings thus suggest that credit market problems may lead to inefficiencies, and constrain intergenerational mobility.",

We then exploit the large heterogeneity across Italian provinces in terms of economic and social outcomes to explore how IM correlates with a variety of outcomes. We find that (i) higher IM is positively associated with a variety of \"good\" economic outcomes, such as higher value added per capita, higher employment, lower unemployment, higher schooling and higher openness and (ii) that also within Italy the \"the Great Gatsby Curve\" exists: in provinces in which mobility is lower cross-sectional income inequality is larger. We finally explore the correlation between IM and several socio-political outcomes, such as crime and life expectancy, but we do not find any clear systematic relationship on this respect.",

We derive several measures of the degree of assortative mating in terms of educational attainment at the country level from parents educational attainment. It turns out that Eastern European countries have a high degree of assortative mating while Northern European countries have a distinctively lower degree. Furthermore, for 12 countries with measures of intergenerational income elasticity, we find a positive relationship between the degree of assortative mating and the intergenerational income elasticity. Compared with other OECD countries, Korea has a somewhat high degree of assortative mating. From the degree of assortative mating by educational attainment, we can infer that the intergenerational income elasticity of Korea might be between 0.3 and 0.4, which is higher than that found in previous studies.Keywords: Assortative Mating, Intergenerational Income Elasticity, PISA, Social Mobility",
    "186": "This paper concerns the problem of inferring the effects of covariates on intergenerational income mobility, i.e. on the relationship between the incomes of parents and future earnings of their children. We focus on two different measures of mobility - (i) traditional transition probability of movement across income quantiles over generations and (ii) a new direct measure of upward mobility, viz. the probability that an adult child's relative position exceeds that of the parents. We estimate the effect of possibly continuously distributed covariates from data using nonparametric regression and average derivatives and derive the distribution theory for these measures. The analytical novelty in the derivation is that the dependent variables involve nonsmooth functions of estimated components - marginal quantiles for transition probabilities and relative ranks for upward mobility - thus necessitating nontrivial modifications of standard nonparametric regression theory. We use these methods on US data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to study black-white differences in intergenerational mobility, a topic which has received scant attention in the literature. We document that whites experience greater intergenerational mobility than blacks. Estimates of conditional mobility using nonparametric regression reveal that most of the interracial mobility gap can be accounted for by differences in cognitive skills during adolescence. The methods developed here have wider applicability to estimation of nonparametric regression and average derivatives where the dependent variable either involves a preliminary finite-dimensional estimate in a nonsmooth way or is a nonsmooth functional of ranks of one or more random variables.",

Conversely, I find that total parental wealth does not have the same positive association for lowincome black families, while home ownership may have negative associations with the likelihood of upward mobility for these families. However, for black families from the top half of the income distribution, home equity is associated with a decreased likelihood of downward mobility, suggesting a heterogeneous relationship between home ownership and mobility for black families.",

    "190": "This paper analyses the role of family risk attitudes in intergenerational mobility in incomes and education. Based on 1984-2009 data of sons and fathers from the German Socio-Economic Panel Survey, there is evidence suggesting that sons with risk taking fathers have a significantly higher educational mobility and persistently higher income mobility than peers with risk averse fathers. They obtain significantly higher levels of education, which would be justified by modest evidence on higher returns to education. The relationship seems more complex for sons own risk attitudes. Risk taking sons experience higher educational mobility, but there is no difference in income mobility to risk averse sons. There are no considerable differences in the levels of education, but modest evidence suggesting lower returns to education for risk taking sons. The findings improve the understanding of the intergenerational transmission mechanism of economic status and show that family risk attitudes impact economic mobility. The study suggests an important intergenerational link between fathers risk attitudes and sons levels of education, which has not received much attention in the literature.",

To answer these questions, we must first clarify how scholars define and measure inequality of opportunity. We discuss the possible mechanisms linking objective measures to subjective perception of the phenomenon, then propose a measure of perceived inequality of opportunity, and finally test our hypothesis by merging data from two sources: the European Union Statistics on Income and Living and the International Social Survey We suggest that the prevailing perception of the degree of unequal opportunity in a large sample of respondents is only weakly correlated with its objective measure. We estimate a multilevel model considering both individual and countrylevel controls to explain individual perception of unequal opportunity. Our estimates suggest that the two most adopted measures of inequality of opportunity have no clear role in explaining its perception. Conversely, other countrylevel variables and personal experiences of intergenerational social mobility are important determinants of how inequality of opportunity is perceived.",

To date, most analyses and assessments of CCTs longterm impact have been based on simulations focused on specific parameters such as income changes and educational attainment. This study takes as its starting point the assumption that any efforts to break the cycle of chronic poverty and exclusion must address their underlying structures and processes. To that end, it presents a social mobility analysis of Uruguay's Asignaciones Familiares and its impact on residential segregation, educational segmentation and labour market segmentation. Based on empirical data from qualitative interviews, household surveys and existing research studies, the programme is found to insufficiently address these asymmetric processes. Without accompanying structural reforms, this limitation will significantly constrain the programme's capacities to promote beneficiaries social mobility by breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty.",

In general, what is found is far from the extremes of either perfect mobility or perfect immobility.

Earnings exhibit more mobility than does total income, and the difference is most striking for daughters. The paper also identifies the influence of family background characteristics on mobility.

Moreover, the motherchild income elasticity increases slightly over childrens birth year, while the fatherchild elasticity is stable, but we do not find any time trend in elasticities.

Mexican Americans who achieve extreme rates of intergenerational mobility straddle class and ethnic contexts, a position that is accompanied by a set of challenges that are unique to middle-class minorities. Socially mobile Mexican Americans retain an enduring familiarity with poverty and must manage intra-class relations with poorer coethnics, who often request financial and social support. As they enter white professional milieus, they must also manage interethnic relations with whites who do not view them as bona fide members of the white middle class. These challenges reinforce class and ethnic boundaries and lead middle-class Mexican Americans who grow up disadvantaged to adopt a minority culture of mobility that manifests through group-specific mobility strategies embedded in ethnic communities, such as creating and joining ethnic professional organizations.",
    "197": "In explaining the demographic transition Caldwell in a series of papers has given singular importance to a change in the direction of intrafamily intergenerational transfers and an associated shift in parental motivations to bear and rear children from economic to psychic advantages which accompanies socioeconomic development and modernization. In 2 recent papers this author initiated a longterm project with the goal of constructing an economic theory of the demographic transition. Early work on this project has several parallels with Caldwells theory and with an independent statement of a similar view by Ryder. The work also emphasized the connection between fertility and the intergenerational distribution of income and consumption within the family and attempts to trace the mechanisms by which socioeconomic development may lead to fertility transition. This paper represents both a summary and extension of the recent work and related theoretical literature with emphasis on its application to demographic transition theory. The main substantive conclusions follow from the assumption that modern economic development is driven by sustained technological change that is translated into growth in real income via investments in human and physical capital. At a given rate of population growth a rise in the productivity of human and physical capital due to improved technology increases the mean age at which it is optimal for an individual to produce his/her lifetime wealth relative to the age at which lifetime wealth is consumed in steady state. This in turn tends to shift the steady state direction of net intergenerational transfers from a situation in which the young transfer to the old under primitive technological conditions to a situation in which the old transfer to the young with more advanced technology. In the former case a rise in population growth increases per capita wealth and welfare and in the latter case it reduces them. The author concludes his reexamination of the Caldwell hypothesis by advancing an alternative version that reverses the line of causation that he emphasizes and instead emphasizes the crucial role that the family and particularly parental altruism plays in the process of economic development. A purely self interested older generation refuses to reduce its consumption either directly of indirecly via intermediary institutions that operate in impersonal private markets because the benefits of the investment are reaped by the younger generation after the older generation is dead. On the other hand an older generation of altruistic parents considers the success of their sons and daughters as a substitute for their own success.",
    "198": "This paper presents a simple model that displays a joint determination of income inequality and intergenerational mobility affected by redistributive taxation. The model shows that a larger redistribution improves equality and utility and enhances mobility when the poor are financially constrained, however it creates a trade-off between the rich and the poor in terms of utility when the poor are financially unconstrained. The model also shows that the size of the redistribution as well as wage inequality play key roles in explaining the cross-country differences in inequality and mobility among OECD countries.",
    "199": "Using the 2006 Mexican Social Mobility Survey, this article evaluates the influence of parental wealth on several outcomes of adult children, including educational attainment, consumption level, asset holdings, home ownership, and home value. Three main findings emerge from the analysis. First, parental wealth is a strong determinant of educational attainment, net of the standard indicators of socioeconomic advantage. Furthermore, the influence of parental wealth appears to be stronger among the most disadvantaged childrenthose with low cultural capital residing in rural areas. Second, the mechanism of parental influence on adult childrens economic well-being differs depending on the outcome: in the case of consumption level, the influence is largely indirect, mediated by offsprings human capital, while the opposite is true for childrens asset holdings, where a direct transfer of resources predominates. Third, access to homeownership is only weakly stratified by economic resources, but parental wealth significantly affects home value. The findings here highlight the critical but largely neglected impact of wealth on inequality and mobility in Latin America.",

    "201": "Although much research has been done on the intra-generational distribution of income and wealth, much less work has been done on inter-generational effects; research in both areas is needed for a complete understanding of the subject. In addition to the study of factors that determine the size distribution of income and wealth, economists should also be interested in the degree of inter-generational mobility that is exhibited in an economy: the extent to which there is equal opportunity for children whose parents' economic position is dissimilar. This issue of mobility is clearly distinct from the issue of equality. For any degree of inequality we can have a relatively static society in which children always assume their parents' position, or a highly mobile society in which the position of the child is unrelated to that of his parents. The degree of inter-generational mobility is determined by market, institutional and genetic factors, among others. The systems that provide education and care for children, distribute public expenditures and transmit material inheritance all influence mobility across generations. This paper presents empirical estimates of the relationship between the material wealth held by parents and that held by their children in the United States. The line of research pursued here was in part inspired by the work of The data comes from probate records and therefore records wealth-holding at a specific point in the life-cycle i.e. at death. The sample is described in Section I. Some simple empirical relationships are presented in Section II. In Section III regression analysis is used to indicate the degree of wealth mobility across one generation. The regression equations can be considered reduced form equations generated by a more complex structural equation system. An example of such a system is presented in Section IV.",
    "202": "There is no denying the major thesis of Christopher Jencks and his collaborators. In the United States, inequality of educational opportunity is not the major component of inequality in the distribution of occupational status or of income. If the unequal distribution of income is the problem, equalizing opportunities-however worthy an objective-is not the solution. Greater equality of income is only likely to be achieved by governmental policies which will directly alter the distribution of income. Jencks et al. have performed a real service by bringing these facts to public attention. In support of its thesis, Inequality essays an exhaustive review and interpretation of the process of socioeconomic achievement. The relevant causal factors are taken to include socioeconomic background and other familial influences, race, sex, cognitive and non-cognitive psychological traits, and the quantity and quality of schooling. Much less attention is devoted to sex and to psychological factors other than academic ability than to the other causes of achievement. Jencks et al. complicate their task by trying to make Inequality accessible to lay persons without compromising their efforts to arrive at best estimate(s) [] of a quantitative model of socioeconomic achievement among white nonfarm U.S. males. The text may be viewed both as a pedagogic essay and as a running commentary on the estimates of the heritability of IQ (Appendix A) and the estimates of the model of socioeconomic achievement (Appendix B) This review is directed to the treatment of occupational status and income in Chapters 6 and 7 of Inequality and to Appendix B, Path Models of Intergenerational Mobility, on which the results of those two chapters depend heavily. In turn the results of Appendix B rest to an important degree on the heritability estimates of Appendix A, but for the present purpose we have simply accepted them. Since the authors attach a large margin of error to their heritability estimates, and since Inequality draws sweeping negative conclusions about the import of the heritability of IQ for socioeconomic achievement, it is disturbing that the estimates for the model of socio-",
    "203": "This article seeks evidence on trends in intergenerational income for cohorts born after 1970. As many of these cohorts have not yet joined the labour market, we must look at relationships between intermediate outcomes (degree attainment, test scores and non-cognitive abilities) and parental income to forecast forward from these to estimates of intergenerational earnings correlations. We find no evidence that the relationship between these intermediate outcomes and parental income have changed for more recent cohorts. Evidence from the earlier 1958 and 1970 cohorts shows that as mobility declined in the past the relationship between intermediate outcomes and parental income strengthened. We therefore conclude that, under realistic assumptions and in the absence of any significant unanticipated changes, the decline in intergenerational mobility that occurred between 1958 and 1970 birth cohorts is unlikely to continue for cohorts born from 1970 to 2000. Mobility is therefore likely to remain at or near the relatively low level observed for the 1970 birth cohort.",
    "204": "This paper reanalyzes 3-stratum intergenerational mobility classifications, assembled by Hazelrigg and Garnier for men in 16 countries in the 1960s and 1970s. Log-linear and log-multiplicative models are used to compare mobility regimes and to estimate effects of industrialization, educational enrollment, social democracy, and income inequality on immobility and other parameters of the mobility process. Several models of mobility fit the data equally well, so criteria of plausibility and parsimony are applied to choose one model of stratum-specific immobility and another model of vertical mobility with uniform immobility. We find substantial similarity in mobility and immobility across countries, but the exogenous variables do explain systematic differences among countries. Cross-national variations are complex because most of the exogenous variables have different effects on different parameters of the mobility regime. Relative to other factors, industrialization and education have weaker effects on mobility regimes than has usually been supposed.",

Using income tax data, this paper provides new evidence on long-term and intergenerational mobility, and persistence at the top of the income distribution. Half of those aged 35-40 in the top or bottom quintile in 1987 remain there in 2007; the others have moved up or down. While 30 percent of dependents aged 15-18 from bottom quintile households are themselves in the bottom quintile after 20 years, most have moved up. Persistence is lower in the highest income groups.",
    "206": "Chrystia Freeland [2012] describes a remarkable episode in the history of Venice, Italy that she believes has important implications for modern America. In 1315, at the height of Venetian economic influence, wealthy Venetians put 'a formal stop to social mobility with the publication of the Libro D'Oro, or Book of Gold, an official registry of the Venetian nobility. If you weren't on it, you couldn't join the ruling oligarchy' () The Venetians called the change La Serrata (The Closure) and within decades a potential democracy became an oligarchy, and economic and social opportunities were closed to all newcomers. As Freeland notes, by 1500 Venice's population was smaller than it was in 1330, and it continued to shrink in the 17th and 18th centuries while the rest of Europe grew.By the end of Greg Duncan and Richard Murnane's edited book, Whither Opportunity? Rising Inequality, Schools, and Children's Life Chances, it is easy to worry that America's own version of the Closure has already begun. In this landmark book, 25 chapters by leading psychologists, economists, and public policy experts focus on the fundamental and ongoing economic changes affecting children's educational opportunities, performance, and likely job trajectories. The conclusions of these authors are complex, sometimes contradictory, and even encouraging at times (e.g. African-American students and young women have recently experienced some substantial academic gains) Overall, however, American income inequality is growing and, as many of these chapters reveal, family income is increasingly predictive of children's educational opportunities and attainments. Social class matters more than ever, and unfortunately Americans are not very good at thinking about class. In their introductory chapter, Duncan and Murnane provide a summary of recent changes in the income and educational opportunities that underlie nearly all of the remaining chapters of the book. The authors begin by describing figure 1 as an illustration of the economic changes in the last 60 plus years of American history. Put simply, inflation-adjusted income for the poorest 20% of Americans nearly doubled from 1947 to 1978 but has remained almost flat for the past 30 years. By contrast, for the wealthiest 20% real income also doubled from 1947 to 1978 but then continued to grow by another one third or more up until 2008. As Robert Reich [2010] aptly described this development, the period from about 1947 to1978 could be called Great Prosperity and from about 1980 to now, the Great Regression. Of course, the full story of growing American income inequality is much more troubling than Duncan and Murnane have room to explore. Figures from the Congressional Budget Office [2011] reveal that income for the wealthiest 20% (minus the top 1%) grew about 50% from 1978 to 2008, whereas real income growth for the wealthiest 1% grew slightly less than 300% (with 660% growth for the top 0.01% of the wealthiest []; see Atkinson, Piketty, & Saez [2011] for more historical data) Although the economic downturn of 2008 had a significant impact on the wealthiest Americans, Stiglitz [2012] and other economists have found that an amazing 93% of all income gains in the recovery year of 2010 went to the wealthiest 1% of all Americans. The larger point for Duncan and Murnane and many economists is not the existence of income inequality per se. The rich were much richer than the poor both at the beginning and end of the Great Prosperity (1947-1978) The relative gaps between income groups, however, did not get any greater; all income groups saw comparable income growth during this period. The economic story of the past 30 years is the increasing growth of income inequality as the gap between the rich and poor keeps growing wider. And as Whither Opportunity makes clear, the growth of income inequality has had profound effects on the educational opportunities and life chances of American children. After describing the growth of income inequality in their introductory chapter, Duncan and Murnane lay the foundation for subsequent chapters by discussing how that income inequality increasingly affects the educational experiences and opportunities of Americans. One central change is that education has been more closely related to income in the past 30 years than it was during the Great Prosperity. The authors note that between 1977 and 2007 inflation-adjusted wages grew 1% for high school graduates, 25% for college graduates, and actually declined 13% for high school dropouts. And, Duncan and Murnane continue, at the same time that income became more closely linked with education, educational mobility (especially for men) declined. Before 1970, fewer than 10% of young American adults had completed less schooling than their parents, whereas by 1990 20% of American men, and nearly as many women, had completed less schooling than their parents. As a result, intergenerational income and educational social mobility are now greater in most European countries than they are in the United States [; Hertz et al. 2008].High school graduation rates have not budged in the last thirty-five years, and the slow growth we have seen in college graduation rates has been due almost entirely to children from middle-class and affluent families Just how increased income inequality influences the skill acquisition and educational attainment of children born into different circumstances is, of course, a much more complicated question and one that consumes the bulk of our volume. [ pp. 6-7]In the remaining book chapters, leading experts examine 'The Developing Child and Adolescent' (Part II, 6 chapters) 'The Family' (Part III, 4 chapters) 'Neighborhoods' (Part IV, 2 chapters) 'Labor Markets' (Part V, 2 chapters) and 'Schools' (Part VI, 10 chapters) Collectively, these different sections provide an emerging picture of what Duncan and Murnane argue is a central dilemma of our time. Compared with most other advanced countries, Americans have always been willing to tolerate a relatively high level of income inequality as long as opportunities for social mobility were also seen as high and relatively fairly distributed. As a nation, we seem much more concerned with equality of opportunity than equality of outcomes. Moreover, Duncan and Murnane claim, Americans believe in relying on schools to level the playing field and promote equal opportunities. But can schools really play this role today? 'Or has growing income inequality affected families, neighborhoods, and local labor markets in a manner that undercuts the effectiveness of schools serving disadvantaged populations? This is the question at the heart of this project' [ ] The remainder of this review focuses on a few key book chapters that both present tentative answers to this question and illustrate the unique intellectual power of this volume.Sean Reardon begins his chapter (chapter 5, 'The Widening Achievement Gap between the Rich and the Poor: New Evidence and Possible Explanations') 'As the income gap between high- and low-income families has widened, has the achievement gap between children in high- and low-income families also widened? The answer, in brief, is yes' [ ] Reardon's longer answer in this chapter is, of course, much more elaborate, but the overall story is strikingly consistent with that initial 'yes.' The chapter draws on data from 19 nationally representative samples that included specific tests of children's reading and/or math abilities (with study birth cohorts beginning in 1945) as well as information about parental income, educational level, and occupational status. Many of the subsequent analyses address differences in average reading and math scores of children from families who are in the 90th percentile of income distribution (about USD 160,000 in 2008) versus children whose families are in the 10th percentile group (about USD 17,500 in 2008) In addition, however, Reardon also compares test score results for black and white children. Two major sets of findings emerge, and one is surprisingly positive: in the past 50 years, differences in black and white test scores have narrowed substantially, although much of this change (especially for reading scores) emerged in cohorts born before 1975. By contrast, the gap in higher- and lower-income children's school achievement (i.e. combined reading and math scores) has increased by more than one third in just over two decades. In concrete terms, the average reading scores of middle school children from poorer families are now more than 3 years lower than the scores of children from wealthier families (i.e. 10 vs. 90% income brackets) - a difference that has nearly doubled since the earliest studies. Reardon's tentative explanations for the increasing effects of income inequality on children's academic performance foreshadow many of the arguments made in subsequent book chapters. For example, one of his final analyses reveals that especially, in families above the national income median (about USD 50,000 in 2008) increased income is now more strongly related to children's academic achievement than it was just a few decades ago. Moreover, this growing gap is not related to parental education. In other words, income per se, and not parental education, is playing a greater role in the increasing gaps in children's academic performance. The exact meaning of this emerging pattern is unclear, although Reardon suggests that families may be changing the ways in which they spend income and time to promote their children's cognitive development. As Reardon explains:At the same time that family income has become more predictive of children's academic achievement, so have educational attainment and cognitive skills become more predictive of adults' earnings As the children of the rich do better in school, and those who do better in school are more likely to become rich, we risk producing an even more unequal and economically polarized society. [ ]A revealing figure at the beginning of the book illustrates inflation-adjusted changes in what parents spent on children's enrichment activities (e.g. books, computers, and summer camps) beginning in 1972 up to 2006. In 1972, the child-related expenditures for the top income quintile was about USD 2,700 greater than the bottom income quintile. By 2006, however, that difference had nearly tripled to more than USD 7,500. Perhaps more tellingly, annual child expenditures in the bottom quintile remained nearly unchanged from 1983 to 2006, while they increased more than 50% in that period for the wealthiest quintile. In their chapter on this topic (chapter 9, 'How is family income related to investments in children's learning') Neeraj Kaushal, Katherine Magnuson, and Jane Waldfogel expand on these findings using information from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, 'a repeated cross-sectional survey that contains detailed data on family income and expenditures' [Kaushal, Magnuson, & ] Not surprisingly, the authors find that the wealthiest income quintile substantially outspends poorer families in every category of enrichment expenditures, including books and magazines, computers, sports, trips, and electronics. More detailed analyses, however, reveal that as family budgets increase even slightly, spending on noncollege tuition (e.g. private schools) daycare, and the single largest category, family trips, increases more than spending on other child expenditures. Maternal education also plays a key role as more educated mothers use more of any increases in family income on child enrichment than their less educated peers. Meredith Phillips describes a related pattern in her chapter (chapter 10, 'Parenting, time use, and disparities in academic outcomes') where she uses nationally representative data to examine how parents spend time with their children. The author finds that between children's birth and age 6, higher-income parents (top economic quintile) spend 1,300 more hours with their children in nonroutine contexts than lower-income parents (bottom economic quintile) Furthermore, during the 2 focal days of the survey, nearly 40% of higher-income parents versus 20% of lower-income parents read to their young children at least once. Phillips [2011] underscores the importance of these differences by noting that: The most enduring and consistent finding in the time-use literature is that reading to young children is positively associated with children's verbal skills [with] estimates that about a third of the association between parental reading and the cognitive skills of toddlers is causal. ()Not surprisingly, the cumulative consequences of these and other changes described in Whither Opportunity extend well beyond children's elementary and secondary years. In chapter 6 ('Inequality in postsecondary education') for example, Martha Bailey and Susan Dynarski use census data and findings from several major longitudinal studies to track changes in college entry and graduation over a 70-year period. In that time, college graduation rates have quadrupled, with 28% of children born in 1975 graduating from college by age 25. This major increase in college graduation rates, however, varied greatly by income group: 'increases were highly uneven, with gains largest at the top of the income distribution and smallest at the bottom' [ ] For example, looking at children born in the early 1980s, 54% from the top income quartile graduated from college compared with 9% from the bottom quartile. The authors conclude with two other equally troubling patterns. First, less than one third of lower-income students who started college graduated compared with a two-thirds college completion rate for higher-income children. And second, 'Even among those who as teenagers had the same measured cognitive skills, inequality in college entry and completion across income groups is greater today than it was two decades ago' [ ] The majority of the chapters in Whither Opportunity address how recent, sweeping changes in income inequality are affecting children's educational and subsequent occupational opportunities. Fortunately, several other chapters (especially in the last section on schools) describe some specific programs that can successfully alter the typical educational trajectories of many low-income children. Some of these programs, like the HighScope Perry preschool intervention, date back almost 50 years, and the questions they raise about the processes that underlie life success are still being debated [see, for example, chapter 3, 'The nature and impact of early achievement skills, attention skills, and behavior problems,' by ] Other programs, like the Harlem Children's Zone [see chapter 23, 'It may not take a village: increasing achievement among the poor,' by Curto, Fryer, & ] have shown that combining extensive after-school programs and community services with high-quality charter school can successfully close 'the gap between poor minority students and the average white student in New York City public schools' [Curto et al. 2011, ].These important programs, and the debates they raise regarding the relative influence of cognitive versus noncognitive and school versus community resources deserve their own books [see, for example, ] and book reviews. Moreover, it is clear, after reading the state-of-the-art chapters in Whither Opportunity, that researchers and educators, as well as parents and other adults are making enormous efforts to understand - and alter - the unequal life opportunities that many American children will face. Yet, by the end of this book, it is almost impossible not to come back full circle to where Duncan and Murnane started in their initial chapter, income inequality.If growing American income inequality is at the heart of many of the negative educational changes described in this book, then reversing that inequality is clearly an essential step in improving children's life chances. But how is it possible even to begin such a politically and economically overwhelming task? Although there are no simple answers to this type of question, Darling-Hammond [2010] provides an initial response in her already influential book, The Flat World and Education: How America's Commitment to Equity Will Determine Our Future:International studies continue to confirm that the U.S. educational system is also one of the most unequal in terms of inputs. In contrast to European and Asian countries that fund schools centrally and equally, the wealthiest school districts in the United States spend nearly 10 times more than the poorest, and spending ratios of more than 3 to 1 are common within states [emphasis added] This creates huge inequalities in educational outcomes that ultimately weaken the very fabric of our nation. ()It would be unfair, however, to end a review of this amazing book by implying that it somehow fails to offer solutions for the underlying problem of growing income inequality. In fact, it was only at the end of this book that I had any real idea of the historic economic and educational forces that are making the life chances of America's children increasingly unequal. Whither Opportunity is one of those books that, like Harrington's [1962] The Other America: Poverty in the United States, has the potential to change our national dialogue about what 'equality of opportunity' really means. It is a book that psychologists, policy researchers, parents, and anyone interested in America's next generation will find thought provoking and disturbing.",
    "207": "A consensus has developed in political and also media circles that in Britain over recent decades social mobility has been in decline. According to the consensus view, as construed in political circles, educational policy is seen as the crucial instrument for increasing mobility. This article shows how the consensus emerged from the research of a group of economists into intergenerational income mobility. It is argued that, primarily on account of various limitations of the available data, the economists finding of declining mobility is open to question; and, further, that, because no explicit distinction is made in their work between absolute and relative rates of mobility, its reception, among politicians especially, has been attended by considerable confusion. An alternative to the consensus view is put forward, based on extensive research by sociologists into social class mobility, which is seen as better capturing the intergenerational transmission of economic advantage and disadvantage. This research indicates that the only recent change of note is that the rising rates of upward, absolute mobility of the middle decades of the last century have levelled out. Relative rates have remained more or less constant back to the inter-war years. According to this alternative view, what can be achieved through education, whether in regard to absolute or relative mobility, appears limited.",

We consider a model of equilibrium short-period financial contracts, where poor agents face credit constraints owing to moral hazard and limited liability. If agents have no bargaining power, poor agents have no incentive to save: poverty traps emerge and agents are polarized into two classes, with no interclass mobility. If instead agents have all the bargaining power, strong saving incentives are generated: the wealth of poor and rich agents alike drift upward indefinitely and history does not matter eventually.",
    "209": "Intergenerational correlations between parental income and child earnings reflect the extent of intergenerational economic mobility and equality of opportunity. Previous estimates are about 0.2, but these estimates suffer from a number of problems, including the use of but one year of observations and of nonrandom samples. We present new estimates based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. These estimates suggest correlations over 0.5 with longerrun income and earning measures, as well as some gender and race differences and some impact of liquidity constraints. They also suggest that the IGE is greater as parental income increases, the opposite of the BeckerTomes conjecture.",

Retrospective information on parental economic status may be exploited by applying a two-sample two-stage least squares estimation. I estimate the intergenerational income elasticity for Italy and investigate the main mobility patterns across the distribution. From an overall comparison, the evidence provided in this paper hints that Italy is in the low-mobility group among advanced societies, in the range of values found in the U.S. and the UK. The transmission of economic status appears to be particularly strong at the top of the income distribution. I investigate the role of education in the transmission of economic status in Italy and find evidence that children with the same level of formal education seem to have unequal chances in the labor market depending on family background.",
    "211": "A bstract Private transfers of income between family members have had significant equalizing effects on the distribution of income in the United States but only recently have they become a subject of research and an element of analysis. Some of the major theoretical developments in the area of income distribution and intergenerational mobility in the rich literature of the grants economy are reviewed. Among the effects of family transfers on income distribution, the most critical considerations in intrafamily transfers, tentative results indicate, are those that relate, directly or indirectly, to investments in children during their formative years. Estimates of the size of family transfers include one that in a single year their total was of the magnitude of 30.7 percent of gross national product and another that in 1980 they were 70 percent of total transfers, amounting at least to 1 trillion. Trends in their level and structure are projected.",
    "212": "We show in this paper that, depending on the initial distribution of material wealth and that of individuals abilities, economies converge in the long run towards different proportions of the skilled workforce and different levels of average wealth. We also show that the growth process raises net economic mobility, the longrun proportion of the skilled population and the longrun levels of wealth held by both rich and poor dynasties. Unless the income tax rate is too high, the increase in total public funds is associated, in the long run, with higher net mobility, a larger fraction of the skilled workers and higher levels of wealth of all the dynasties. In addition, the reallocation of public expenditures from basic to advanced education can result in lower mobility, a lower longrun size of the skilled workforce, and a lower longrun level of wealth held by rich dynasties, if the transfer of resources comes at the expense of excessively lowering the quality of education at the basic schooling level.",
    "213": "We build on crossnational research to examine the relationships underlying estimates of relative intergenerational mobility in the U nited S tates and G reat B ritain using harmonized longitudinal data and focusing on men. We examine several pathways by which parental status is related to offspring status, including education, labor market attachment, occupation, marital status, and health, and perform several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. We decompose differences between the two nations into that part attributable to the strength of the relationship between parental income and the child's characteristics and the labor market return to those child characteristics. We find that the relationships underlying these intergenerational linkages differ in systematic ways between the two nations. In the United States, primarily because of the higher returns to education and skills, the pathway through offspring education is relatively more important than it is in Great Britain; by contrast, in Great Britain the occupation pathway forms the primary channel of intergenerational persistence.",
    "214": "This article measured opportunity inequality in Brazil by combining a series of theoretical and empirical tools. The database was built using a two-sample instrumental variable (TSIV) developed by Angrist and Krueger. After that, the axiomatic approach put forward by O'Neill et al. was used, in which the estimation of children's income distribution function is conditional on their fathers' wages. The inference process was based on nonparametric local logistic regression. The results indicate that Brazil has a high level of opportunity inequality. In other words, in the context of intergenerational mobility, those whose fathers belong to lower income strata have to expend greater effort in order to attain a certain income level.

    "215": "next are a major cause of inequality in general and of the unequal distribution of wealth in particular. Despite the popularity, not to say antiquity, of this view, surprisingly little is known about the nature and extent of these transfers (here called bequests, but interpreted to include gifts inter vivos) or about their motivation. Similarly, models of saving and accumulation have tended to be somewhat cavalier about bequests, either assuming them away altogether or treating them in an ad hoc fashion, for example, by tacking an arbitrary of on to a life-cycle model. It seems more satisfactory to derive bequest behaviour as part of the solution to some more general optimum problem. The most obvious framework for this approach is one in which individuals are altruistically motivated with respect to their children, and will choose to make bequests if, for example, they expect that the children would otherwise have markedly lower lifetime consumption than their own. Recently, several models of this dynastic-consumption equalizing type have been constructed (e.g. ; 1979; ) In each case the intention of the models is to explore the functional dependence of the equilibrium distributions of wealth and consumption on the distribution of lifetime earnings. This paper is in that tradition. The present model is designed to study how the inter-generational transmission of inequality is affected by inter-generational earnings mobility, asymmetry between positive and negative bequests, the strength of parental altruism, the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption and the return on wealth. The paper also examines whether the predictions generated by a model of this type are broadly consistent with what is actually observed. The first two considerations pose particular problems of analysis. Inequality may be transmitted by transfers of human wealth as well as by transfers of the material kind, and these two mechanisms are interrelated. Unless intergenerational mobility is perfect there will be some inter-generational link in earnings; hence high-earning individuals will choose a level of bequests in the expectation that their children may themselves be relatively high earners. The interesting question concerns how sensitive the wealth distribution is to different degrees of inter-generational earnings mobility. The sources of that mobility are, in the present analysis, less important than its extent, subject at least to the assumption that individuals cannot much alter the latter by manipulating the former. In what follows it is assumed that transfers of human wealth are entirely unplanned while those of material wealth are entirely planned.' The asymmetry between positive and negative bequests has two aspects. Suppose it seems desirable to an individual that some degree of consumption equalization takes place, but that this involves transfers to him from his children. Can he make a negative bequest? In general he can do so only with the active",

Young households (selected persons under 18) are followed and income mobility (defined as changes in household disposable equivalent income) is followed across generations. In addition, socioeconomic mobility (defined as changes in the socioeconomic status of household head) is followed across generations. These two approaches of measuring mobility will tell us to what extent sons and daughters follow in their fathers' footsteps before the rise of the welfare state in Sweden. The results indicate significant intergenerational income mobility for both periods, while the period from 19251947 seems to be more mobile. In addition, socioeconomic mobility increased during the last period, 19361958. Hence, even before the rise of the welfare state, Sweden had high intergenerational income mobility.",

The economic welfare of children is indexed by per capita family wage and salary income. In the decade surrounding World War II, there were two economic worlds for children one for whites and one for racial minorities. The economic differences among children of European origin were relatively minor compared to the gap between whites and nonwhites. Children of Mexican origin fell closer to the racial minorities than to whites. The primary reason for the lower economic welfare of minority children was the low income of household heads. The primary findings are related to the study of intergenerational mobility for youths in 1940 and 1950.",

We show that the bequest-income transition rule for each child should be linearly combined to form an inter-generational income transition rule which dominates the dynamics of the underlying stochastic processes. The various bequest division rules correspond to different linear combinations of parent-child bequest transition, and hence distinct intergenerational mobility matrix. Under different assumptions about parents' information background, we derive conditions needed to establish the causal relationship between more equal bequest division and better income distribution in the sense of second-degree stochastic dominance.",

Findings on social class, occupational status, earnings, and income mobility are discussed and discrepancies among them are evaluated. The review also examines nonlinearities in the intergenerational association, variation in mobility across advanced industrial countries, and recent mobility trends in the United States. The literature suggests an association between inequality and economic mobility at the country level, with the United States featuring higher inequality and lower mobility than other advanced industrial countries. However, mobility has not declined in the United States over the recent decades in which inequality has expanded. The inequality-mobility relationship fails to emerge when occupational measures of mobility are used, likely because these measures do not fully capture some mechanisms of economic reproduction.",

In this paper, I estimate the IGE using an income dynamic model with intergenerational linkages. The model can explicitly account for sources of biases such as heterogeneous age profile and transitory shocks of changing variance over the lifecycle. The model can be identified through the covariance structure of earnings within individuals and across generations. Based on the models, I simulate the lifetime income of both generations and calculate the implied IGE.Using PSID data from the United States and GSOEP data from Germany, the estimated IGE of fathers and sons is substantially higher than those in the literature.

    "223": "Previous studies of intergenerational income mobility have not considered potential birth-order or family-size effects in the estimated income elasticity. This article uses a large sample of individuals born between 1962 and 1964; income elasticities with respect to parents' incomes are estimated for individuals with different birth-order positions and family sizes. Results based on labour income and total income for sons and daughters are reported separately. The elasticity tends to decrease with family size as well as with birth order for a given family size, especially in the labour-income analysis of fathers and sons.

Notes 1See Solon (Citation1999) for a survey. 2sterberg (Citation2000) presents a much lower estimate, 0.13. Grawe (Citation2006) organizes estimates of intergenerational earnings elasticity by mean age of fathers and finds a pattern of low elasticity in samples with old fathers. Considering that sterberg observes fathers late in the life cycle, Grawe concludes that her result is not to be seen as an outlier. sterberg also includes nonbiological fathers, which is likely to reduce the elasticity. See sterbacka (Citation2001) for results on Finnish data. 3See e.g. Becker and Tomes (Citation1986) for an overview of results from 1970s and 1980s. 4However, such a finding would, at least to some degree, depend on the model being incorrectly specified and using more flexible functional form may yield a different result. 5Behrman and Taubman (Citation1986) point out that these arguments date back to 6Black et al use twin data to address this issue, so the ambition is to study causal effects. 7Using a 2-year average of income in the dependent variable does not change the results in the analysis. 8Note that the individuals in the study are not related to each other and that gender composition is not taken into account. 9Total income in 1970 is the net of deductions while total income in 1975 and 1980 is not. The difference, however, is expected to be very small. 10The age restriction of fathers reduces the fatherson sample from 20150 to 18002 observations. 11The average income of the mothers in this sample is SEK 191000 (SE 60000) so it is reasonable to assume that most mothers work fulltime. 12Note that sex composition is not taken into account here; for instance, first-born sons may have either younger sisters and/or younger brothers. 13In the labour-income analysis, fathers who have experienced unemployment are included as long as a positive income is reported for at least one of the income years. 14The following variables are included in regression but excluded in presentation: simple dummy variables for order and size, order*size, age, age-squared, age variables interacted with order and size. This regression yields exactly the same estimates and SE as those in Table 4. 15The effects are not fully separated since the sizeorderincome interactions are included. It is also worth noting that separation of the birth-order effects from the family-size effects is complicated by the fact that being, e.g. the fourth child implicates that the child comes from a family of at least four and so on. 16There may, however, be problems when measuring income of farmers and the self-employed. For example, self-employed people may not report income as wages.",

The methodology enables us to investigate how sensitive results are to different delimitations and, thereby, to make more accurate international comparisons of intergenerational earnings mobility. We find that intergenerational earnings mobility is found to be substantially lower when hourly wage rates rather than annual earnings are used, whether the latter are inclusive or exclusive of public transfers. Moreover, when the same specifications are applied for Denmark as for other countries, we find that intergenerational earnings mobility from father to son in Denmark is on the same level as in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, whereas the intergenerational earnings mobility in all the Nordic countries is found to be higher than in the United Kingdom and the United States.",

To address these problems, this paper provides the consistent estimate of the intergenerational income elasticity in China, and also extends the standard model by incorporating government spending into it. It is found by IV estimate that China's intergenerational correlation in long-term income is 0.830, and paradoxically, government spending in public education fails to effectively make the society more mobile. However, by measuring the effect of the Compulsory Education Law using the DID method, this paper finds that public education has significantly raised the beneficiaries' income by 43% Therefore, although public education appears to have a rather restrictive effect in the short run, increase in government spending aimed at poor families helps to mitigate the intergenerational transmission of economic status in the long run. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",
    "227": "This paper analyzes theoretically and empirically the impact of intergenerational transmission of human capital on the income mobility in China. We use a three-period overlapping-generations (OLG) model to show that the human capital transfer plays a remarkable role in determining the parent-to-offspring investment in human capital and the IGE of income. We then estimate a simultaneous equations model (SEM) using the 1989-2009 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data to verify our theoretical predictions. The results show that (i) human capital, measured by health and education, is directly transmitted from one generation to the next, reflecting the parent-induced inequality of development opportunities among offspring in China; (ii) the estimated intergenerational income elasticity increases from 0.429 to 0.481 when the direct transfer of human capital is accounted for, suggesting that omitting this mechanism would overestimate China's income mobility. Our findings provide policy implications on strengthening human capital investments among the disadvantaged groups, reinforcing reforms that promote equality of opportunity, and improving the efficiency of labor markets in China.",

Estimates from a simulation model reveal that baby boomers had more wealth than their actual samesex parents at every stage of the life course.

    "231": "Most explanations of rising income inequality stress technology and labor market change. Here, the author focuses on marriage behavior and womens employment. The evidence suggests that assortative mating tends to heighten inequalities when it is accompanied by couple similarities in labor supply and earnings capacity. An equalizing effect of womens employment will primarily emerge when lower educated womens labor supply increases rapidly. In the second part of the article, the author adopts a dynamic perspective, focusing on intergenerational mobility. Mothers employment is positive for childrens life chances because it minimizes poverty risks. And if external child care is of high quality, maternal employment has no negative effects on child outcomes. The rise in female employment may therefore also help diminish the reproduction of inequalities.",
    "232": "Existing empirical work looking at the effects of parental income on IQ, schooling, wealth, race, and personality is only able to explain about half of the observed intergenerational income elasticity. This paper provides a possible behavioral explanation for this elasticity in which heterogeneous agents in sequential generations choose their education levels in the face of loss-averse preferences and weak borrowing constraints. These borrowing-constrained agents make education investment choices in part to avoid consumption losses rather than to maximize lifetime resources. The model generates a positive intergenerational income elasticity even when there are functioning capital markets to finance education investments. I find empirical support for the J-shape education decision rule generated by the model and show that it is mostly successful in matching the asymmetric intergenerational transition rates between income quintiles of white families.",
    "233": "The theory of inequality and intergenerational mobility presented in this essay assumes that each family maximizes a utility function spanning several generations. Utility depends on the consumption of parents and on the quantity and quality of their children. The income of children is raised when they receive more human and nonhuman capital from their parents. Their income is also raised by their \"endowment\" of genetically determined race, ability, and other characteristics, family reputation and \"connections,\" and knowledge, skills, and goals provided by their family environment. The fortunes of children are linked to their parents not only through investments but also through these endowments acquired from parents (and other family members) The equilibrium income of children is determined by their market and endowed luck, the own income and endowment of parents, and the two parameters, the degree of inheritability and the propensity to invest in children. If these parameters are both less than unity, the distribution of income between families approaches a stationary distribution. The stationary coefficient of variation is greater, the larger the degree of in-heritability and the smaller the propensity to invest in children. Intergenerational mobility measures the effect of a family on the well-being of its children. We show that the family is more important when the degree of inheritability and the propensity to invest are larger. If both these parameters are less than unity, an increase in family income in one generation has negligible effects on the incomes of much later descendants. However, the incomes of children, grandchildren, and other early descendants could significantly increase; indeed, if the sum of these parameters exceeds unity, the changes in income rise for several generations before falling, and the maximum increase in income could exceed the initial increase.",

Paperback $27.95, 1SBN 1-56324-788-7. By replicating in 1991 a survey he had previously conducted in 1963, Robert Marsh has made a major contribution to our understanding ofboth social change in Taipei City and the strengths and weaknesses ofsome current social theories when tested against the surprises of East Asian development. Marsh formulates an eclectic \"neomodernization\" approach to overcome criticisms ofa \"traditionalto -modern\" model in which market industrialism leads to democracy and thence to global cultural convergence. From his important longitudinal study, Marsh concludes that \"convergence among modernized societies is neither inevitable nor impossible\" () Yet the book focuses more on, and reveals much more of, social than political transformation. Using repeated cross-sectional design, first 507 (1963) and then 545 (1991) cases were drawn from Taipei household registers, and their middle-aged male household heads were interviewed by assistants fluent in the relevant local languages The substantial interview schedules provided information on a broad range oftopics, mostly clustering under four heads: economic/technical; industrial /occupational; family/kinship; and stratification/mobility. Predictably, the first two relatively unambiguous topics proved less problematic in analysis than the second two. While Taiwan's economic expansion in the intervening decades has brought increased complexity to the spectrum ofproductive activities and significant absolute change in people's occupations, industrial/technical change has not greatly altered the relative relationships of the population. Marxist class, Weberian stratification, and Panglossian social mobility are all considered, as are the difficulties ofresolving the different outcomes ofrelationship-to-means-ofproduction versus prestige-hierarchy assessments. The comparison between 1963 and 1991 shows high and increasing intergenerational occupational mobility; intragenerational mobility was high, but not increasingly so, over these decades. In both samples, \"more than two times as many men moved out of their fathers' occupations than can be explained by changes in occupational structure\" () Clerical/white collar workers came to occupy a greater proportion ofall jobs as both the manual proletariat and small-business ownership declined. 1997 by UniversityMarsh's attempts to harmonize contradictions from differentkinds ofclass/ ofHawaii Pressoccupational data and to account for the modest shift in their longitudinal structure are ofgreat interest. More questions remain, however, than can be answered by focusing, as Marsh consciously does, on Taipei City as a unit. During most of 496 China Review International: Vol. 4, No. 2, Fall 1997 these years, Taipei was unrivaled at drawing wealth (and hence layers of clerks and middle managers) from the entire island for both government and business. Also, by the late 1970s, proletarian and petty-producer jobs were migrating to China and Southeast Asia as Taipei-based enterprises entered these regions. Another possibly very important factor in the shift in Taibei's class structure is the 1980s effort by face-conscious officials and environment-sensitive citizens to expel dirty production processes from the city. Locating the city as the center of an expanding system of profit-extraction would seem to explain much of the shift in occupational structure and class consciousness that Marsh documents so well. For many researchers, the book's greatest value will lie in its exploration of kinship and gender issues. Despite the male bias in the sampling data, women are not neglected; Marsh offers frequent evidence that the gender division of labor has changed little. As wives, women appear as mediators in what turns out to be an important factor in male (and thus family) social mobility: \"while the educational attainment of a man is influenced by his father's status, the later stages of his occupational attainment are more influenced by his father-in-law's status\" () This useful and original finding should prove very helpful in better integrating class and gender in future studies. Throughout, Marsh treats kinship as seriously as it deserves to be taken in an East Asian setting. Running counter to an older, Eurocentric image of modernization in Taiwan, although families' \"support for traditional, ideal normative obligations toward parents and extended kin has declined, the behavioral.",
    "235": "Applied researchers have been drawn to models that attribute the demonstrated crosscountry differences in intergenerational income transmission to government failures to invest in the human capital of poor children. To highlight another potential mechanism, the disincentive effects of labor market taxation and redistribution, we present a simple model that can explain crosscountry differences in intergenerational mobility and other previously observed empirical patterns. Empirical tests using data on income mobility, tax rates, and public expenditures largely support the model predictions. We conclude that the common presumption that intergenerational mobility largely measures fairness or opportunity, and the resultant policy recommendations, are premature ( JEL D31, J24, J62)",
    "236": "There is a type of rampant negativism at large in the recent work of some scientists concerning the plight of the less fortunate in American society. As slavery had its Fitzhugh, and reconstruction its Sumner, more recently we have been privy to the revelations of Banfield, Moynihan, Jensen, and Christopher Jencks. Some of these gentlemen, especially Jencks, have emphasized a different set of variables at work than those which have been traditionally more highly esteemed. For example, Jencks plays down the importance of education as a means to economic equality and emphasizes the change which might result if economic variables are dealt with directly. The fact that Jencks himself has doubt about whether Americans really want economic equality does little to absolve him of the responsibiity for providing much material for the rationalization of mass public oppression. The situation becomes even more frustrating when we consider that the finding may have been based on an improper application of scientific methodology. Essentially, Christopher Jencks and his cohorts have reanalyzed a portion of the Coleman data, adding a bit here and there, and come up with some startling conclusions. The main one being that there is not much that can be done to improve the lot of America's disadvantaged groups unless we are willing to abandon some of our current schemes in favor of new or different ones. More specifically, Jencks proposes that efforts should be made to reduce income inequality directly, rather than educational inequality, since the correlation between income and educational variables is so low. But how does Jencks go about reaching this conclusion? What is the analytic and methodological base for what he eventually surmises? The bulk of Jencks's work is based on the analysis summarized in Appendix B of the book and headed Path Models of Intergenerational Mobility. The basic analytic method is path analysis, a highly sophisticated although somewhat questionable statistical technique used primarily in social research as a means of calculating the extent to which change in one phenomenon is attributable to or influenced by change in another phenomenon. Jencks continually indicated that he was aware of limitations in his data and analytic method and was careful to point these out. However, at certain points his discussion of findings implies that he did not take the pitfalls as seriously as he might have.",

The household nature of the data allows us to link parents' incomes to children's incomes at different points in time. Using a quantile regression analysis instead of mean one reveals that the effect of fathers' earnings are different across the conditional distribution of sons' earnings, particularly being larger on the upper quantile than on the lower quantile. After controlling effect of sons' college education by including a dummy variable for the degree, however, the pattern among quantile effects for fathers' earnings is no longer clear.

A significant decline is estimated in the intergenerational transmission elasticity from the 1930 birth cohort until the baby boom cohorts of the early 1950s. After that we observed no increase in the extent of mobility for 1950s and 1960s birth cohorts, but rather the reverse. The result holds both for sons and daughters. A decomposition of the intergenerational transmission elasticities across cohorts shows that most of the early decline in transmission reflected a drop in the influence of parental income on the children's earnings that operated through investments in the child's schooling. This early pattern is postulated to reflect the phases of secondary educational expansion at the time. Throughout, a rise is estimated in the intergenerational transmission elasticity with age at which sons and daughters are observed. This has also been noted in prior U.S. studies and, at least in this Finnish context, this seems to result almost entirely from rising estimated returns to education with age.",

Our indicator of intergenerational income mobility is based on a random coefficient model, which allows for variation in intergenerational mobility across families due to multiplicative unobserved familyspecific characteristics.

Longitudinal data on actual parentchild pairs spanning 197892 are employed. Regression and correlation coefficients are analyzed and transition matrices calculated in order to investigate income mobility over generations. The results achieved show high intergenerational income mobility in Sweden between fathers and sons in comparison to estimations performed in most other countries and more especially compared to the U.S. This indicates that Sweden does not only have lower crosssectional income inequality, but also higher intergenerational income mobility than those countries. The mother's earnings influence children's earnings less than the father's. However, the mother's earnings correlate more strongly with a daughter's earnings than they do with that of a son.

The study uses two data sources including one that contains social security earnings for a large intergenerational sample. I find that recent cohorts of blacks are not only significantly less upwardly mobile but also significantly more downwardly mobile than whites. This implies a steady-state distribution in which there is no racial convergence in income. A descriptive analysis using covariates reveals that test scores in adolescence can explain much of the racial difference in both upward and downward mobility. Family structure can account for some of the racial gap in upward mobility but not downward mobility. Completed schooling and parental wealth also appear to account for some of the racial gaps in intergenerational mobility.",

The analyses in this text explore these questions by developing and testing a model in which the earnings of children with different genetic endowments respond differently to investments in human capital. Behrman, Pollak and Taubman use this model to investigate issues such as: parental bias in resource allocations based on gender or birth order; the extent of intergenerational mobility in income, earnings and schooling in the United States; the relative importance of environmental and genetic factors in determining variations in schooling; and whether parents' distributions offset the intended effects of government programmes designed to subsidize children. In allocating scarce resources, parents face a trade-off between equity and efficiency, between the competing desires to equalize the wealth of their children and to maximize the sum of their earnings.",

This result indicates that Turkey is a highly mobile society. This elasticity estimate is lower than those usually reported for the United States. In addition, this elasticity estimate suggests that there is greater mobility in Turkey than in the United States. In addition, this mobility rate is higher than many other countries.",

This paper proposes an informal institutional mechanismthe community-based networkthrough which families belonging to the same neighbourhood or kinship group can bootstrap their way out of such low-skill occupational traps. The insight from the dynamic model that is developed is that once they form, new networks providing mutual support to their members and substituting for inherited parental human capital and wealth will strengthen most rapidly in historically disadvantaged communities, generating a correspondingly high level of intergenerational mobility. These predictions are successfully tested using unique data from India. The analysis in this paper, coupled with an emerging empirical literature on networks and migration, provides a new perspective on mobility in developing countries, with restrictive traditional networks decaying even as new networks supporting collective mobility form and strengthen over time.",

If parents love their children, why are these intergenerational transfers politically sustainable? This paper develops a cross-national overlapping generations model to explore the impact of income mobility on the way workers and retirees calculate the long-term value of these programs to their children. Mobility affects their evaluations because these programs also redistribute intragenerationally. The analysis shows why a majority of rational voters who care about their descendants can insist on the preservation of current public pension benefits for themselves but accept a future reduction. Implications of this explanation are tested using comparative intergenerational mobility data and a 2001 Eurobarometer survey on pensions.",

Reducing the extent to which an individual's economic or social success is shaped by the economic or social position of their parents has been on the agenda of the Italian government for a long time and is at the root of the Italian centralized and egalitarian system of education. However, our empirical results suggest that the achievements of children continue to be highly dependent on the social status of their parents, especially their fathers. Whilst Italy's egalitarian education system may have removed some of the inequities in human capital accumulation arising from capital market imperfections, it would seem that additional measures are required to further facilitate intergenerational social mobility.",

A large proportion of this growth came from the mass influx of migrants from Mainland China, and the children born to them. During the 1960s and 1970s when Hong Kong's economy was booming rapidly, career advancement opportunities were abundant even for the less educated migrants and their children. But when the economic restructuring occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, trades such as manufacturing and construction sectors, where a large number of workers with migration background were employed, were hit most hardly. The problem of the intergenerational transmission of poverty and low social mobility has now become the focus in the agenda of poverty alleviation. This article aims to use a subsample of the 2006 By-Census dataset to explore whether children with migration background from Mainland China were generally disadvantaged in their educational attainment and income. The findings confirmed this hypothesis, indicating that the human capital investment strategy in Hong Kong is not sufficient to break down the barriers for children in disadvantaged social positions.",
    "260": "This paper conceptualizes intergenerational occupational mobility between the farm and nonfarm sectors in five A frican countries, measures it using nationally representative household survey data, and analyzes its determinants through a comparative method based on pooled logit regressions. We first analyze intergenerational gross mobility. Until the end of the 1980s, intergenerational flows toward the nonfarm sector are high in C te d' I voire and G uinea, flows toward the farm sector are more often observed in G hana and U ganda, and M adagascar displays less mobility in either direction. The pace of change in occupational structures and the magnitude of labor income dualism between the farm and nonfarm sectors appear to explain those differences. We then net out structural change across generations and establish the first measurement of intergenerational net mobility in those five A frican countries. G hana and U ganda stand out as relatively more fluid societies. C te d' I voire and G uinea come next while M adagascar shows a particularly high reproduction of occupations. Educational mobility accounts for the M adagascar exception to a large extent, but not for the differences between the other countries. Spatial dualism of employment, i.e. the geographic segregation of farm and nonfarm jobs, accounts for most of those remaining differences. We argue that the main determinants of intergenerational mobility, namely income and employment dualisms, likely reflect a historical legacy of different colonial administrations.",
    "261": "We argue that stability and increasing fluidity coexist in the contemporary Japanese social stratification system. It is often argued that the weakening of Japanese employment practices has made the labor market more flexible. While there is evidence to support this argument, it misses an important factor in the labor market, namely social stratification. We suggest that some parts of the labor market have become more fluid, while other parts have been stable. To test this prediction, we examine empirical findings made in the 2005 Social Stratification and Social Mobility Survey Project, covering such topics as education and inequality, increasing fluidity and disparity among young workers, job changes, and income inequality. Our findings on education and inequality show that stratification in the educational system affects the entry of graduates into regular or non-regular employment. Our analysis of young workers shows that while the longterm employment practice persists in large firms and the public sector and thus shows stability, mobility between regular and non-regular employment is difficult and that young female graduates from high schools and junior colleges recently find it difficult to enter the regular employment sector. Our analysis of the effect of education on job changes shows that the income of less educated workers who change jobs has decreased recently. We also find increasing income inequality between professionals and other occupations and examine the intergenerational transmission of income. We conclude that these findings generally support our prediction that stability and increasing fluidity coexist in the contemporary Japanese labor market. We consider the implications of this for the study of social stratification in Japan.",

The model is used to analyse the neo-liberal theory of stratification and to assess the consequences of some of the criticisms that have been made of it. In particular, the intergenerational transmission of wealth and privilege, and the existence of ethnic, gender and other forms of ascriptive disadvantage, reduce economic efficiency, although they do not always diminish the extent of social mobility. Furthermore, excessive intragenerational inequality may inhibit, rather than encourage, economic growth. We show that there is no necessary link between rates of social mobility and levels of economic growth. This, we suggest, provides an explanation of why rates of social mobility show very little cross-national variation and display no very evident trend over time towards greater societal openness.",

We argue that this pattern reflects changes in the importance of dynastic wealth, with the share of women proxying for inherited wealth. If so, wealth mobility decreased until the 1970s and rose thereafter. Such an interpretation is consistent with technological change driving long-term trends in mobility and inequality, as well as the recent divergence between top wealth and top income shares documented elsewhere.

Specifically, links between educational achievement and parental income / social class strengthened during this period. Furthermore, a person's actual (measured) ability became a poorer predictor of whether they would get a degree than was previously the case. The expansion of higher education in the UK during this period appears to have disproportionately benefited children from richer families rather than the most able. Furthermore, the labour market success or failure of individuals became more closely connected to their parents' income, revealing a fall in the extent of intergenerational mobility over time.",

The familial power structure serves the purpose of preserving stable relations of production and continuity in a materially advantageous status quo. In such economies the net intergenerational wealth flow is upward with women and the young consuming less and contributing more labor than men and elders. In the West where parents spend more on children and depend less on them the net intergenerational flow of wealth is a downward one. After industrialization in the West the precapitalist familial mode of production continued to oeprate inside households. A 2-tiered system of production thus prevailed until changes in the market economy gradually eroded the familial hosuehold mode of production thus leading to social change and making it uneconomic to have large families. Developing countries will no doubt pass through the same stage of a 2-tiered mode of production but the transition to a capitalist mode of production will be shorter due to the availability of contraceptives and the impact of education and the Western example emphasizing sex and age equality.",
    "269": "The research on intergenerational correlations in outcomes is increasingly moving from measurement into assessment of causal transmission mechanisms. This paper analyses the causal impact of fathers' job loss on their children's educational attainment and later economic outcomes. To do so, we isolate the effect of job loss associated with major industry contractions, mainly in manufacturing, during the recession of the 1980s by mapping industrylevel employment change data from 1980 to 1983 into the British Cohort Study (BCS) Children with fathers who were identified as being displaced did significantly worse in terms of their GCSE attainment than those with nondisplaced fathers. A child with a displaced father obtained, on average, 18 grade points lower or half a GCSE at grades A*C less than their otherwiseidentical counterparts, the equivalent of about 2 per cent lower wages as an adult. There is also a small effect of fathers' displacement on the early labour market attachment of children, but no direct impact on their earnings at age 30/34. This does not mean that the impact of job loss will not affect social mobility. Those with lower income, education and social class were most affected by job losses and there is a direct effect on education and youth unemployment, which we know to be drivers of later earnings. This suggests that the recent recession may have significant longterm consequences for the children of those who have lost their jobs.",

Using administrative data containing the earnings histories of parents and children, the IGE is estimated to be around 0.6. This suggests that the United States is substantially less mobile than previous research indicated. Estimates of intergenerational mobility are significantly lower for families with little or no wealth, offering empirical support for theoretical models that predict differences due to borrowing constraints.",

When available, prospective data on intergenerational mobility, which are based on a sample of respondents who report on their progeny, have conceptual and practical advantages. Prospective data are especially useful for studying social mobility across more than two generations and for developing joint models of social mobility and demographic processes. Because prospective data remain relatively scarce, we propose a method that corrects retrospective mobility data for the unrepresentativeness of the parental generation, and thus permits them to be used for models of social mobility and demographic processes. We illustrate this method using both simulated data and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. In our examples, this method removes more than 95% of the bias in the retrospective data.",

This paper shows that the income-education association varies greatly across groups of children with different versions of a specific gene, monoamine-oxidase A (MAOA) which impacts neurotransmitter activity. For children with one MAOA variant, increases in household income have the expected positive association with education. For children with another variant, who comprise over half of the population, this relationship is much weaker. These results hold when the interactive effects are identified using genetic variation between full biological siblings, which genetic principles assert is as good as randomly assigned.",

    "275": "China's One Child Policy (OCP) introduced in 1979, changed fundamentally the nature of both existing and anticipated marriage arrangements and influenced family formation decisions in many dimensions, especially with respect to the number of and investment in children. The policy coincided with the Economic Reforms of 1979 and the trend toward greater urbanization, all of which may have influenced the wellbeing of children. This paper examines the mobility status consequence of children in urban China since the introduction of the OCP and the economic reforms using data drawn from urban household surveys in China. The analysis first makes the comparison between child poverty in Canada, the United Kingdom and urban India, where it was found that both status and trends of child poverty are very different among the countries, with children not being overrepresented in the poverty group in urban China. The extent to which the policies influenced investment in children is next examined by studying the way in which the relationship between the educational attainment of children and family characteristics changed within families formed prior to and after 1979. We found that the impact of household income and parental educational attainment increased significantly over time, with a positive gender effect where girls advanced more than boys. Applying new techniques for measuring mobility, we observe the reduction in intergenerational mobility. This phenomenon is found to be particularly prevalent in the lower income quantiles, reinforcing a dynastic notion of poverty.",
    "276": "Early developing and persistent gaps in child achievement by family income combined with the importance of adolescent skill levels for schooling and lifetime earnings suggest that a key component of intergenerational mobility is determined before individuals enter school. After documenting important differences in early child investments by family income, we study four leading mechanisms thought to explain these gaps: intergenerational ability correlation, consumption value of investment, information frictions, and credit constraints. We evaluate whether these mechanisms are consistent with other stylized facts related to the marginal returns on investments and the effects of parental income on child investments and skills.",
    "277": "This paper addresses the intergenerational mobility question by examining the role of family structure in the transmission of educational attainment within a family using the one percent Integrated Public Use Microsample Series (IPUMS) of the decennial Census for the decades 1970 and 1990. We first introduce mobility indices and tests which examine the proximity of the transition matrix to that which would pertain in the perfectly mobile state. Unlike existing transition matrix based mobility indices, these indices and tests can be employed when the transition matrix is not square, and when the transition matrix is between states that are defined multivariately or more generally when the quantiles of the marginal states are unmatched. Using educational attainment as a proxy for permanent income for children and both educational attainment and income as proxies for parents, the tests indicate that mobility significantly increased, both in the population as a whole and within intact parent and single parent sub-populations, over the period. Within the single parent group there was much less evidence for significant mobility change for children from exogenous single parent families than for children from endogenously single parent families, which accords with theoretical predictions. There is also some evidence of convergence between intact and single parent groups, suggesting that there is a trend towards equal opportunity for children of intact and endogenously single parent families.",
    "278": "We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to describe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a childs income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.",
    "279": "Scholarly investigations of intergenerational mobility typically focus on either the occupations of fathers and sons or their incomes. Using an identical sample of fathers and sons, we examine how estimates of intergenerational mobility in income and occupational prestige are affected by (1) measurement that uses long time averages and (2) varying the point in the life cycle when outcomes are measured. We find that intergenerational occupational mobility is overstated when using a single year of fathers occupation compared to a 10-year average centered on mid-career. We also find that for both income and occupation, mobility estimates are largest when sons are in their mid-career, suggesting that this may be the ideal period in which to measure their status. Finally, we see differences in the pattern of estimates across the two types of measures: for income, estimates of intergenerational persistence are highest when fathers are in their mid-career; for occupation, estimates are much larger when fathers occupations are accounted for late in their careers.",
    "280": "Now that some of the historic barriers to economic success for U.S. women and minorities have begun to fall, women and blacks, in particular, are moving upward on the nation's socioeconomic ladder. Melissa Kearney reviews evidence that improved economic opportunities for these two groups make sex and race less important than they once were in determining economic status. But sex- and race-based differences in wages and income persist, and interactions between sex and class and between race and class continue to play a role in the intergenerational transmission of income status. Kearney surveys studies and data showing that marriage remains important in determining women's economic status, even though marriage rates among women aged eighteen to thirty-four have been fallingfrom 73 percent in 1960 to 44 percent in 2000. Not only do spousal earnings continue to dominate family income for married women, but also women tend to marry men whose position in the income distribution resembles their fathers' position. Marriage thus facilitates the transmission of economic status from parents to daughters. Racial wage gaps persist, says Kearney, largely because of differences in education, occupation, and skill. It also appears likely that the effects of discrimination, both current and past, continue to impede racial economic convergence. Kearney notes that the transmission of income class from parents to children among blacks differs noticeably from that among whites. Black parents and white parents pass their economic standing along to children at similar rates. But because mean income is lower among blacks than among whites, the likelihood of upward mobility in the overall income distribution is substantially lower among blacks. Black children are much more likely than white children to remain in the lower percentiles of the income distribution, and white children are more likely to remain in the upper reaches of the income distribution. Downward mobility from the top quartile to the bottom quartile is nearly four times as great for blacks as for whites.",

They also suffer from sample selection issues and further bias driven by spells out of work.

When all three biases are considered, our best estimate of lifetime intergenerational economic persistence in the UK is 0.43 for children born in 1970. Whilst we argue that this is the best available estimate to date, we discuss why there is good reason to believe that this is still a lower bound, owing to residual attenuation bias.",

We find that intergenerational mobility in S pain is similar to that in F rance, lower than in the N ordic countries and B ritain, and higher than in I taly and the U nited S tates.

    "283": "One consequence of the rise in inequality witnessed over the past 40 years is its potentially negative impact on intergenerational mobility if parents at the bottom of the income distribution invest significantly less in their children's human capital. I consider whether public investments in children can potentially offset the inequality of private investments. Specifically, examining changes in public spending in 25 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries over the period 2000-2009, I find that increases in spending on health are most strongly associated with reductions in the importance of family background and declines in inequality in the production of child human capital as measured by the Program for International Student Assessment test scores among 15-year-olds. Public spending on family support, housing, and education are also moderately related. In contrast, increased spending on the elderly is associated with increases in the importance of parental background and inequality of child test scores. These results suggest that public investments in child human capital have the potential to offset the potentially negative impact of increasing income inequality on intergenerational mobility and inequality of the next generation. Further research firmly establishing a causal relationship is needed.",

Despite the seemingly inescapable logic of this model, its empirical support is weak. We examine the link between income and net fertility using data from wills on reproductive success, social status and income for England 15851638. We find that for this society, close to a Malthusian equilibrium, wealth robustly predicted reproductive success. The richest testators left twice as many children as the poorest. Consequently, in this static economy, social mobility was predominantly downwards. The result extends back to at least 1250 in England.",
    "285": "Intergenerational mobility in income and education is affected by the influence of parents on children's school choices. Our focus is on the role played by different school systems in reducing or magnifying the impact of parents on children's school choices and therefore on intergenerational mobility in general. We compare two apparently similar educational systems, Italy and Germany, to see how the common feature of separate tracks at Secondary School level may produce different impacts on children choices. Using data from a cross-country survey (PISA 2003) we study the impact of parental education on track choice, showing that the greater flexibility of the Italian system (where parents are free to choose the type of track) translates into greater dependence from parental background. These effects are reinforced when moving to post-secondary education, where the aspiration to go to college is affected not only by the school type but also (in the case of Italy only) by parental education. We then move to country-specific data sets (ISTAT 2001 for Italy and GSOEP 2001 and 2002 for Germany) to study the impact of family background on post-secondary school choices: we find this impact is greatly reduced when we control for secondary school tracks. Overall, we estimate large asymmetries by gender, with women's behavior more independent from family backgrounds than men's behavior.",
    "286": "We use a two-sample instrumental variables approach to estimate a time series of intergenerational economic mobility using the decennial U.S. Censuses. We find that the intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) followed a roughly U-shaped pattern from 1940 to 2000 that is similar to well known cross-sectional inequality trends. In particular, we find that intergenerational mobility (measured as 1 minus the IGE) increased from 1940 to 1980 but has declined sharply since 1980. The decline after 1980 is robust to alternative estimation approaches. This suggests that the rate of regression to the mean has been notably lower during the 1980s and 1990s compared to the three decades after WWII. Historical trends in the returns to education can only account for some of these changes in the IGE. The time pattern and the changes across birth cohorts may also help to reconcile previous findings in the literature that have used different surveys. Our estimates imply a somewhat different pattern for the intergenerational income correlation, a measure which is insensitive to changes in cross-sectional inequality and has implications for rank or positional mobility. We find that the post-1980 decline in intergenerational rank mobility marks a return to typical historical levels. At the end of the 20th century, the rate of movement of families across the income distribution across generations appears historically normal, but, as cross-sectional inequality has increased, earnings are regressing to the mean at a much slower rate, causing economic differences between families to persist longer than they had earlier in the century.",

In this context typical occupational levels of economic compensation may be a useful proxy for personal",
    "288": "Research on intergenerational earnings mobility in less developed economies is lacking. This paper investigates the case of Singapore, a newly-industrialized economy in Asia. Interval regressions are employed because of grouped dependent variables. Instrumental variables address problems of respondent errors and unobserved permanent income. Still, the estimated IGE of between 0.23 and 0.28 is probably under-estimated because the study uses a survey of young respondents who reported contemporaneous incomes of parents. Transformation of the estimates using scales in recent comparative studies indicates that intergenerational earnings mobility in Singapore may be moderately low when compared internationally. Education as a means through which parents invest in their children's future earnings appears important. There are some small independent returns from schooling. Mobility does not appear to differ by ethnicity, sex or income. These findings have important implications for equity, development and policy in Singapore, which has rising income disparity, a maturing economy, and an educational system which is increasingly privately run.",

Educational attainment estimates reveal that this was a product of high-income families being more responsive to improving schools than poor families.",

The first section of this paper explains a benchmark measure of intergenerational mobility commonly used in U.S. studies. The second section summarizes comparable empirical findings that have accumulated so far for countries other than the United States. The third section sketches a theoretical framework for interpreting cross-country differences in intergenerational mobility.",

We employ Bayesian model averaging methods that allow for model uncertainty to identify robust predictors of spatial mobility. In doing so we pay special attention to the specification of model and parameter priors. We also investigate the heterogeneous effects of these predictors on spatial mobility across commuter zones in different average income quintiles. Our findings suggest a more nuance and complex characterization of the spatial mobility process than that proposed by Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez.",
    "292": "My focus is on the degree to which increasing inequality in the high-income countries, particularly in the United States, is likely to limit economic mobility for the next generation of young adults. I discuss the underlying drivers of opportunity that generate the relationship between inequality and intergenerational mobility. The goal is to explain why America differs from other countries, how intergenerational mobility will change in an era of higher inequality, and how the process is different for the top 1 percent. I begin by presenting evidence that countries with more inequality at one point in time also experience less earnings mobility across the generations, a relationship that has been called The Great Gatsby Curve. The interaction between families, labor markets, and public policies all structure a child's opportunities and determine the extent to which adult earnings are related to family backgroundbut they do so in different ways across national contexts. Both cross-country comparisons and the underlying trends suggest that these drivers are all configured most likely to lower, or at least not raise, the degree of intergenerational earnings mobility for the next generation of Americans coming of age in a more polarized labor market. This trend will likely continue unless there are changes in public policy that promote the human capital of children in a way that offers relatively greater benefits to the relatively disadvantaged.",

It is well known that Mexicans have not attained economic parity with whites, but there is considerable debate about the degree to which Mexican immigrants and their American-born children experience mobility over their lives. We contribute to this literature by studying Mexican American wealth ownership, focusing on three interrelated processes. First, we examine childhood poverty and inheritances to establish financial starting points and to identify the degree to which resources from prior generations affect wealth ownership. Second, we study impediments to mobility in young adulthood to understand how childhood conditions create early adult obstacles to well-being. Third, we study midlife net worth and homeownership to better understand whether childhood and young adult impediments necessarily reduce adult wealth ownership. We find high levels of early life disadvantage among Mexican Americans, but these disadvantages are least pronounced in the second and third generations compared to the first generation. Consistent with prior research, we also find high levels of young adult impediments to mobility for Mexican Americans. However, we find that these early roadblocks do not necessarily translate into lower adult wealth: we show that Mexican Americans have less total wealth than whites but more than African Americans, even when early life impediments are controlled. Our results suggest that Mexican Americans are establishing a solid financial foundation that is likely to lead to long-term class stability.",
    "294": "Parents play major roles in determining the human capital of children, and thus the income of children when they become adults. Models of investments in childrens human capital posit that these investments are determined by parental resources (financial and human capital) and child endowments within particular market and policy environments. Many empirical studies are consistent with significant associations between parental resources and investments in their children. And there is considerable emphasis in the scholarly and the policy literatures on the degree of intergenerational mobility and the intergenerational transmission of economic opportunities, and therefore the intergenerational transmission of poverty or of affluence. Therefore policies or other developments that affect the extent of poverty and/or inequality in the parents generation are likely to have impacts on the extent of poverty and/or inequality in the childrens generation. However the extent of these intergenerational effects is an empirical question that this paper explores using the Young Lives data to estimate intergenerational associations between parental resources and investments in human capital of children and then, under the assumption that these associations reflect causal effects, to simulate what impacts changes in poverty and inequality in the parents generation have on poverty and inequality in the childrens generation. The results suggest that reductions in poverty and in inequality in the parents generation reduce poverty and inequality in the childrens generation some, but not much.

    "295": "The relationship between the incomes of the family a child is growing up in and the education level the child obtains has been of great interest to researchers for a number of reasons. Firstly, this gives us a measure of educational inequality in its own right and secondly, because the relationship between family income and education is also one of the key drivers of intergenerational income mobility across time in the UK and gradients in life chances across a range of other domains. This paper explores the evolution of the relationship between family income and education for a group of cohorts from those born in 1958 to those born in 1991/92. The range of educational relationships we can measure depends on the age of the child. For older cohorts, who we observe as finished in education, we can measure the full range of educational outcomes up to degree level and their relationship with family income. For younger cohorts who are in earlier stages of education, we can measure test scores and GCSE results but not later educational outcomes.",
    "296": "This study uses a new data set that contains the Social Security earnings histories of parents and children in the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation, to measure the IGE in earnings in the United States. Earlier studies that found an IGE of 0.4 have typically used only up to five-year averages of fathers' earnings to measure fathers' permanent earnings. However, dynamic earnings models that allow for serial correlation in transitory shocks to earnings imply that using such a short time span may lead to estimates that are biased down by nearly 30 percent. Indeed, by using many more years of fathers' earnings than earlier studies, the IGE between fathers and sons is estimated to be around 0.6 implying significantly less mobility in the U.S. than previous research indicated. The elasticity in earnings between fathers and daughters is of a similar magnitude. The evidence also suggests that family income has an even larger effect than fathers' earnings on children's future labor market success. The elasticity of earnings is higher for families with low net worth, offering some empirical support for theoretical models that predict differences due to borrowing constraints. Some evidence of a higher elasticity among blacks is found but the results are not conclusive.",

We estimate the IGE of the earnings and income of offspring with respect to parental income using microdata from the 19932004 rounds of the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers. The estimated IGE using predicted parental income is 0.410.46 for married sons, 0.300.38 for married daughters, and marginally less than 0.30 for single daughters. A downward trend in elasticity is also observed. Quantile regression does not suggest any particular relation between elasticity and quantiles. A nonlinear analysis of the relation between parental log income and log earnings of offspring illustrates an S-shaped relation for married sons and single daughters, and a linear relation for married daughters.",

Property ownership - as measured by net worth - reflects this legacy of economic oppression. The racial discrepancy in wealth holdings leads to advantages for whites in the form of better schools, more desirable residences, higher wages, and more opportunities to save, invest, and thereby further their economic advantages.

The mean estimated earnings elasticities are almost identical: 0.26 in Singapore and 0.27 in the United States. Transformed to 0.45 and 0.47 respectively to reflect permanent status, mobility in the two countries is moderately low compared internationally. The finding of similar mobility is not surprising given that the economic realities, welfare systems, education regimes, and labor structures in the two countries are similar. Policy makers face the daunting challenge of overcoming immobility and inequality while maintaining global competitiveness.",
    "300": "This paper considers the long-run distribution of capital holdings in a model with complete asset markets and progressive taxation. Households are assumed to be heterogeneous in their labor market productivity. With homogeneous preferences and monotone-increasing marginal tax rates, we prove that agents who are not borrowing-constrained must have the lowest income in the population. Corollaries of this fact are that capital and labor income must be negatively correlated, which then implies that so must income and wealth. We then show how to construct models with preference heterogeneity that match the data on income, assets, and hours worked. Using this model we estimate the consequences of changing the progressivity of the tax code; we find that the model can produce mobility in wealth but not in income.",

The intergenerational income elasticity point estimate for all Dunedin Study participants was .26 when using fathers' incomes to explain children's incomes, with the 95% confidence interval stretching from .14 to .39. Even with controls for the gender of participants and their father's age, the proportion of variance explained was only 13% For the nation-wide Election Study the point estimate for the effect of father's socio-economic status (SES) on the SES of respondents was .20 for respondents aged 25 years and older, with a 95% confidence interval of .16 to .24. However, father's SES and the age and gender of respondents explained only 5% of the variance in respondents SES. We have to be cautious when interpreting our results because both datasets contain proportionately fewer Maori and Pacific peoples than the New Zealand population, the Election Study data is now almost 13 years old, and the Dunedin Study participants have not reached their peak earning years. Our intergenerational income mobility estimate for New Zealand has wide confidence intervals, while confidence intervals for estimates of intergenerational occupational mobility are not available for most countries. As a result, we reached few firm conclusions about New Zealand's relative position compared to other countries.",
    "302": "A bstract This article adopts Chadwick and Solon's (2002 ) model by using family earnings in the study of intergenerational earnings mobility with a highlight on the role of assortative mating. I analyze mean and quantile regression coefficients as well as transition matrices to investigate family earnings mobility between parents and daughters and parents and sons from Swedish register data. My findings indicate that Sweden has a higher degree of mobility compared to the United States, and that assortative mating also plays an important role as a channel through which income status is transmitted across generations in Sweden. However, the difference in intergenerational mobility patterns between the two countries does not, inherently, depend on factors that affect the marriage match. Swedish daughters and sons exhibit a rather similar scheme of intergenerational earnings transmission. Daughters tend to be slightly more mobile than sons, and the difference between their elasticity estimates is small but statistically significant. The quantile regression approach reveals that parents' family earnings are less important as an explanatory variable at the upper end of the children's earnings distribution than they are at the bottom, while transition matrices show substantial earnings persistence in the top earnings class.",

Regression estimates of fatherson correlations and analyses of intergenerational transition matrices show substantial persistence in wealth even when we correct for measurement errors in parental wealth. We do not find wealth mobility to be higher between periods of a person's life than between generations. We find that the process of household division plays an important role: sons who splinter off from the father's household experience greater (albeit downward) mobility in wealth. Despite significant occupational mobility across generations, its contribution to wealth mobility, net of human capital attainment of individuals, appears insignificant. Low wealth mobility in our data is primarily explained by intergenerational persistence in educational attainment.",

The Gini coefficient of sons lifetime income within these groups exhibits a correlation of 0.71 with our IGE estimates, leading us to conclude that as the United States has become economically less equal in recent years it has also become less mobile.",
    "305": "Many authors have recently suggested that the heterogeneity in the quality of early education may be one of the key mechanisms underlying the intergenerational persistence of earnings. This paper estimates the effect of a major educational reform on the intergenerational income mobility in Finland. The Finnish comprehensive school reform of 1972-1977 significantly reduced the degree of heterogeneity in the Finnish primary and secondary education. The reform shifted the tracking age in secondary education from age 10 to 16 and imposed a uniform academic curriculum on entire cohorts until the end of lower secondary school. We estimate the effect of the reform on the correlation between son's earnings in 2000 and father's average earnings during 1970-1990 using a representative sample of males born during 1960-1966. The identification strategy relies on a difference-in-differences approach and exploits the fact that the reform was implemented gradually across municipalities during a six-year period. The results indicate that the reform reduced the intergenerational income correlation by seven percentage points.",

Empirically, the question is brought down to an application with US General Social Survey data. For the identification of a causal relationship, I use a structural approach and estimate a recursive bivariate probit that controls for selection on unobservables.

    "307": "Based on statistical and ethnographic data, this article examines intergenerational transmission inequalities according to sex and sibship birth order, beginning with an analysis of asset transfers from one generation to another. Later-born siblings prove to be the favoured recipients of early financial transfers, while plans for social mobility are invested in first-born sons, which increases their income expectations and predestines them to receive the family property, albeit belatedly. Only children, whether male or female, receive both these different resources. Effectively, inequality in terms of inheritance reflects specific positions in social reproduction strategies, as revealed by the unequal educational and work achievements of boys and girls, and first-born and later-born siblings. An analysis of asset transfers from generation to generation thus reveals the differentiated treatment of children in the same sibship, above all when it comes to passing on cultural capital. Despite changes in the role of inheritance in social stratification, that which can be passed on to reproduce or improve social status remains a rival good that is shared between brothers and sisters in a more or less equal fashion.",

After some alternative explanations for this paradox are addressed, a formal model is developed to show that a majority of rational voters who care about their descendants can support the preservation of current benefits for themselves but accept the prospect of Social Security's future retrenchment. Incorporating elements of Tabellini's (2000) positive theory of Social Security and Bnabou and Ok's (2001) analysis of income mobility, the model identifies specific forces affecting this timevarying individual support for Social Security. These forces are embodied in three hypotheses related to income mobility, relative income level, and age. An ordered logit analysis of cumulative ANES data supports these hypotheses.",
    "309": "In the case of France, we analyse the changes (i) in the skill premium linked to each level of education and (ii) in the impact of parents skill and income upon the educational attainment of their children. To this end, we build a theoretical model which is subsequently estimated. Our calculations firstly reveal (i) a critical decline in the skill premium of the Baccalaureate in relation to the lowest skill level, and (ii) an increase in the skill premia of higher education in relation to the Baccalaureate, which however is not large enough to avoid the decrease in all the skill premia relative to the lowest skill. Secondly, we find (i) a significant increase in the impact of the family backgrounds upon the individuals education from 1993 to 2003 which essentially derives from a higher impact of parental income upon the educational attainment, and (ii) an increase in the impact of public expenditure upon education. Consequently, if inequality has decreased among the employed population, the slowdown in intergenerational mobility could reverse this tendency in the longer term. This may however be offset by higher public educational expenditure.",

Agents differ by sex, marital status, and human capital. Single agents meet in a marriage market and decide whether to accept or reject proposals to wed. Married couples must decide whether to separate or not. Parents invest in their children depending on their wherewithal. A simulated version of the theoretical prototype can generate an equilibrium with a significant number of femaleheaded families and a high degree of persistence in income across generations. To illustrate the model's mechanics, the effects of two antipoverty policies, namely child support and welfare, are investigated.",

Although analysis is still restricted to a handful of countries, one conclusion appears clear: Intergenerational income mobility is weaker in Latin America than in industrial countries and is characterized by persistence at the top, a pattern consistent with the high levels of economic concentration in the region. However, social class mobility in Latin America does not differ from that in the industrialized world. This essay reviews two generations of mobility research since the 1960s, takes stock of current findings on economic and class mobility in Latin America, examines the linkages between mobility and macro-level factors, and engages a new literature on equality of opportunity. I suggest that the comparative understanding of mobility in Latin America can inform and inspire research in the industrialized world.",

The overlapping-generation structure of the model permits evaluation of different aid schemes in their implications on the aggregate outcomes, income distribution, and intergenerational mobility.

    "313": "We present new evidence on trends in intergenerational mobility in the United States using administrative earnings records. We find that percentile rank-based measures of intergenerational mobility have remained extremely stable for the 1971-1993 birth cohorts. For children born between 1971 and 1986, we measure intergenerational mobility based on the correlation between parent and child income percentile ranks. For more recent cohorts, we measure mobility as the correlation between a child's probability of attending college and her parents' income rank. We also calculate transition probabilities, such as a child's chances of reaching the top quintile of the income distribution starting from the bottom quintile. Based on all of these measures, we find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s. However, because inequality has risen, the consequences of the birth lottery - the parents to whom a child is born - are larger today than in the past.",
    "314": "Intergenerational mobility in income and education is affected by the influence of parents on childrens school choices. Our focus is on the role played by different school systems in reducing or magnifying the impact of parents on childrens school choices and therefore on intergenerational mobility in general. We compare two apparently similar educational systems, Italy and Germany, to see how the common feature of the presence of separate track at Secondary School level may produce different impacts on children destinies. Using data from cross-country surveys (PISA 2003) we study the impact of parental education on track choice, showing that the greater flexibility of the Italian system (where parents are free to choose the type of track) translates into greater dependence from parental background. These effects are reinforced when moving to post-secondary education, where the aspiration to go to college is affected not only by the school type but also (in the case of Italy only) by parental education. We then move to country-specific data sets to study actual college choices in nationally representative sample, and we find that parental education still play an independent role on student choices.",

We find that assortative mating plays an important role.

This effect is driven by strong spouse correlations in human capital, which are larger in Germany than Britain.",
    "317": "Using data from three British birth cohort studies, we examine patterns of social mobility over three generations of family members. For both men and women, absolute mobility rates (i.e. total, upward, downward, and outflow mobility rates) in the partial parents-children mobility tables vary substantially by grandparents social class. In terms of relative mobility patterns, we find a statistically significant association between grandparents and grandchildrens class positions, after parents social class is taken into account. The net grandparents-grandchildren association can be summarized by a single uniform association parameter. Net of parents social class, the odds of grandchildren entering the professional-managerial class rather than the unskilled manual class are at least two and a half times better if the grandparents were themselves in professional-managerial rather than unskilled manual-class positions. This grandparents effect in social mobility persists even when parents education, income, and wealth are taken into account.",

They desire to accumulate wealth for its own sake this is not a life-cycle model. A competitive firm produces a single good from labor and capital; the rate of return to capital and the wage rate are market-clearing. The second model introduces political lobbying by the wealthy, whose purpose is to reduce the tax rate on capital income. The third model introduces differential rates of return to capitals of different sizes. The fourth model introduces inheritance and intergenerational mobility.",

Using survey data from successive rounds of the National Sample Survey between 1983 and 2005, we find that intergenerational education and income mobility rates of SC/STs have converged to non-SC/ST levels during this period. Moreover, SC/STs have matched non-SC/STs in occupation mobility rates. We conclude that the last 20 years of structural changes in India have coincided with a breaking down of caste-based barriers to socioeconomic mobility.",
    "320": "Research on intergenerational economic mobility often ignores the geographic context of childhood, including neighborhood quality and local purchasing power. We hypothesize that individual variation in intergenerational mobility is partly attributable to regional and neighborhood conditionsmost notably access to highquality schools. Using restricted P anel S tudy of I ncome D ynamics and census data, we find that neighborhood income has roughly half the effect on future earnings as parental income. We estimate that lifetime household income would be $635,000 dollars higher if people born into a bottomquartile neighborhood would have been raised in a topquartile neighborhood. When incomes are adjusted to regional purchasing power, these effects become even larger. The neighborhood effect is twothirds as large as the parental income effect, and the lifetime earnings difference increases to $910,000. We test the robustness of these findings to various assumptions and alternative models, and replicate the basic results using aggregated metropolitanlevel statistics of intergenerational income elasticities based on millions of Internal Revenue Service records.",
    "321": "Intergenerational mobility is of immense interest to social scientists, in part due to the persistence of the quest for the American Dream. Intergenerational mobility is a gauge of the opportunities each group has to increase their privilege, class, and income. In addition, mobility helps researchers understand the way our society creates class structures. Many studies have addressed intergenerational mobility, focusing on socioeconomic status (SES) of the fathers and its effect on their sons. Other studies have looked at father's effect on son's and daughter's occupational mobility. The effect of father's SES on daughter's SES has been overlooked thus far. This study examined the intergenerational mobility of SES and if there are differences in the transmission of father's SES to their sons and daughters. Secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979-2002) was used for the analysis. An alternative model was created in order to examine three sets of relevant theories; individual, structural, and gender-level. Univariate, bivariate and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression were utilized for analysis. Bivariate analysis shows that men have higher SES than women. OLS regression results indicate that father's SES has a positive effect on their children's SES, net of other factors, but no statistical difference was found between sons and daughters.",
    "322": "The IGE of income is considered one of the best measures of the degree to which a society gives equal opportunity to its members. While much research has been devoted to measuring this reduced-form parameter, less is known about its underlying structural determinants. Using a model with exogenous talent endowments, endogenous parental investment in children, and endogenous redistributive institutions, we identify the structural parameters that govern the IGE of income. The model clarifies how the interaction between private and collective decisions determines the equilibrium level of social mobility. Two societies with similar economic and biological fundamentals may have vastly different degrees of intergenerational mobility depending on their political institutions. We offer empirical evidence in line with the predictions of the model. We conclude that international comparisons of IGE of income are not particularly informative about fairness without taking into account differences in politico-economic institutions.

This result is in stark contrast with the finding on the basis of social class; intergenerational mobility for this outcome is found to be unchanged. Our aim here is to explore the reason for this divergence. We derive a formal framework which relates mobility as measured by family income or earnings to mobility as measured by social class. Building on this framework we then test several alternative hypotheses to explain the difference between the trends. We find evidence of an increase in the intergenerational persistence of the permanent component of income that is unrelated to social class. We reject the hypothesis that the observed decline in income mobility is a consequence of the poor measurement of permanent family income in the 1958 cohort.",
    "324": "A basic theme in the theory of international trade has been to study welfare gains and income redistribution caused by trade liberalization. Using optimizing finite lives overlapping generations combined with long-term real assets and adjustment costs in accumulating capital, this paper establishes new current account and welfare redistribution results caused by financial liberalization. After briefly describing the model for the closed economy case, we study the resulting evolution of the current account, the accumulation of capital, the real wage behavior and the adjustment of asset prices, when capital flows are allowed. Under the mentioned framework, we are able to show that an unanticipated liberalization of the capital account can cause an overshooting or an undershooting in external debt behavior during the transition. Another consequence associated with the liberalization policy, is the creation of some transitional welfare losers, eventhough the welfare of steady state generations is improved. By following appropriate compensatory policies, we can show that the country may achieve a Pareto welfare improvement for current alld future generations. As a wav of reducing the intergenerational redistributions induced bv the opening of the capital account, we discuss the alternative of adopting more gradual strategies of liberalization.",
    "325": "Between 2007 and 2009 a combination of the housing market collapse and the Great Recession caused the median net worth of black families to drop 49% compared with a 29% decline for white families. As a result, the median white-black wealth ratio increased from 12-1 to 22-1. While black families experienced a greater hit in percentage terms, white families lost much more in absolute levels. These changes have profound implications for inequality and mobility in the United States. Utilizing longitudinal income and wealth data from the PSID, this paper examines the differential impact of the recent recession on the wealth holdings of black and white families and the implications for upward and downward intergenerational mobility. I find that parental wealth promotes upward mobility for low income white families, but does not protect against downward mobility from the top half of the income distribution. I conclude that the recession will cause increased inequality in the next generation by dampening the mobility prospects of higher income black families, while somewhat lessening the mobility-gap at the bottom of the income distribution.

This is consistent with a unidimensional latent factor governing a substantial part of the complicated underlying wealth dynamics and wealth of past generations summarizing almost all relevant information when predicting child wealth.

We measure intergenerational mobility at the local (census commuting zone) level based on the correlation between parents and childrens earnings. We show that the level of local tax expenditures (as a percentage of AGI) is positively correlated with intergenerational mobility and that this correlation is robust to introducing controls for local area characteristics. To understand the mechanisms driving this correlation, we analyze the largest tax expenditures in greater detail. We find that the level and the progressivity of state income taxes are positively correlated with intergenerational mobility. Mortgage interest deductions are also positively related to intergenerational mobility. Finally, we find significant positive correlations between state EITC policy and intergenerational mobility. We conclude by discussing other applications of this methodology to evaluate the net benefits of tax expenditures.",
    "330": "The level of intergenerational income mobility is by now reasonably well understood across countries, but for many countries, including Sweden, little is known about its change over time. We exploit newly available data to extend existing estimates for Sweden using parental incomes starting in 1960 and offspring income up until 2007. This allows us to examine how the persistence of long-run income has changed for offspring cohorts born in 1945 to 1962 using a reasonably wide window to measure long-run incomes for both parents and offspring. By exploiting these longer time series, we are also able to study how sensitive estimated trends are to parts of the life-cycle relative to longer-run income measures. The paper thus aims to provide the first set of estimates for trends in intergenerational income persistence in Sweden, and explore their robustness to measurement problems that stem from variations in the income process across the life cycle.",
    "331": "The emergence of persistent political hierarchy and economic inequality beginning about eleven thousand years ago may be explained in part by the novel equilibrium network structures that post-Pleistocene ecological and economic conditions supported. I explore how changes in the nature of wealth and the division of labor could have induced transitions among three stable network structures: symmetric networks with little political hierarchy or economic inequality, asymmetrical networks with political hierarchy but little economic inequality and asymmetrical networks with both hierarchy and inequality. As in Kets, Iyengar, the distribution of benefits on these networks is limited by the feasible coalitions that may withdraw from the existing network, where membership in a coalition is restricted to those who are within distance k in the network. A distribution of benefits on a network is stable if no feasible coalition can benefit by deviating from the network. In addition to k, the key determinant in the mapping from economic conditions to the above three equilibrium networks is the extent of intermediation decay in network benefits and the degree of intergenerational transmission of a population's important forms of wealth. Ethnographic and archaeological data from forager, horticultural and herding populations illustrate the model.",

We measure social status both through wealth at death, and through average age at death. Our method allows an unbiased estimate of the mobility rate. Paradoxically we find two things. The mobility rate is lower than conventionally estimated. There is considerable persistence of status. But because the process continues uninterrupted generation after generation, 8-12 generations will wipe out all trace of earlier advantage and disadvantage. The upper class will dissolve into the mass of society, and the underclass rise to a comfortable mediocrity. The only difference is that there will be substantially more descendants of the lower class in all future generations than of the upper class.",

Masson thereby elaborates a gentle critique of the moral principles often lying beneath the analyses of liberal economists (such as the demonstration effect, disenfranchisement, or the theory of homo reciprocans) Accepting the ambitions of economic science, Masson nonetheless maintains a conception of the social sciences that is more competitive than cooperative and provides convincing analysis of the economic and social foundations of current intergenerational transfers. The argument developed in this critical note proposes both a historical reading of the ideology of intergenerational equity, which is only conceivable in the transition from the Trente Glorieuses to the Trente Piteuses, and a structural reading arguing that, for the wealthy classes during the European Old Regime, successful transfers of wealth between generations followed the same formal requirements as those in the twenty-first century.",
    "337": "Previous literature has discussed the role of assortative mating and of social class differences in fertility on the inheritance of financial wealth and the degree of wealth inequality. This paper argues that assortative mating and differential fertility play the same sort of role in the intergenerational transmission of human wealth. A path model of the intergenerational transmission of human wealth is constructed from correlations taken from the literature. Estimates are then derived of the extent to which permanent income inequality would be reduced by the elimination of assortative mating, of differential fertility, and of unwanted fertility. Social scientists have long been aware of the fact that the size distribution of income and wealth is influenced by fertility and marital patterns. If inheritances are an important part of total wealth (as they certainly are in traditional agricultural societies in which land is the major form of wealth) and if the poor have more children than do the rich, the equilibrium inequality in wealth and income will be greater than in a society where fertility is the same across social classes [22] Similarly, the degree of assortative mating by inherited wealth will be positively related to the inequality in wealth and income. Marital and fertility patterns also have an effect on the degree of intergenerational social mobility, which could be measured by the correlation between the son's rank in the distribution of wealth or income and that of his father.

    "338": "Recent estimates of intergenerational income transmission suggest that there are vast cross-country differences in economic mobility. Under the most common models this is attributed to a combination of credit constraints and failure of some nations to adequately invest in the human capital of poor children. These models sometimes lead to the presumption that intergenerational mobility measures capture indices of fairness or opportunity and to policy recommendations to lower them. In this paper we show that such reasoning is premature. We present an alternative model, which makes many of the same observed predictions as educational underinvestment models, but has the opposite normative conclusions. In this model the disincentive effects of labor market taxation and redistribution, not public educational underinvestment, drive cross-country differences in intergenerational mobility. We test the predictions of our model using data on income mobility, tax rates, and public expenditures. The data largely supports the model predictions.",

In particular, my objective is to estimate IGE (IGE) of sons and daughters individual earnings and individual income with respective to their fathers individual earnings. The two-sample two-stage least squares (TS2SLS) estimation is employed to achieve the research objective using two primary samples of father-son pairs and father-daughter pairs from Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) of 2012 and one secondary sample from Vietnam Living Standards Survey (VLSS) of 1997-98. My results show that the baseline IGE estimates of Vietnamese sons are 0.361 and 0.394 for individual earnings and individual income, respectively. For Vietnamese daughters, the baseline IGE estimates are 0.284 and 0.333 for individual earnings and individual income, respectively. These IGE estimates explicitly reveal that Vietnam has the intermediate degrees of individual earnings and individual income mobility across generations for both sons and daughters by the international comparison.",

Third, using the propensity score matching method (PSM) the paper estimates the effect of entrepreneurial activity on income. Results show that entrepreneurs have more options for upward social mobility. For entrepreneurs with low-income parents, it is more difficult to reach the top of the socioeconomic distribution compared to those with middle- or upper-class parents.

Finally, the mean effect of entrepreneurial activity on income is positive, and is greater for those whose parents belonged to the extreme ends of the socioeconomic distribution.",
    "341": "Conventional wisdom and previous literature suggest that economic mobility is lower at the tails of the income distribution. However, the few studies that have estimated intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) at different points of the distribution in the U.S. were limited by small samples, arrived at disparate results, and had not estimated the trend of elasticity over time. Using the PSID database, a large sample of income observations in the 19802010 period for the U.S. is built, which allows us to obtain robust quantile estimates of the IGE both for the pooled sample and for each wave. For the pooled sample, the IGE shows a U-shaped relation with the income distribution, with higher values at the tails (0.64 at the tenth percentile and 0.48 at the ninety-fifth percentile) and a minimum value highest mobility- of 0.38 at the seventieth percentile. The trend evolution of the IGE also varies across the income distribution: at the lower and mid quantiles, income mobility increased during the 80s and 90s but declined in the 00s, while for the higher quantiles it remained relatively stable along the whole period. Finally, the impact of education and race on mobility is evaluated. Both factors are found to be important and related to the position at the income distribution.",

    "343": "This paper analyses the effects of innate ability, compulsory education (grades 1-9) and non-compulsory education (grades 10-12 and higher education) on inequality and intergenerational mobility of income, by constructing a four-period overlapping-generation model. We find that innate ability and family investment in early education play important roles in explaining income inequality and intergenerational income mobility. Though children from the wealthiest families are only 1.36 times 'smarter' that those from the poorest, the gap in human capital expands to 2.35 at the end of compulsory education and to 2.89 at the end of non-compulsory education. One important reason for the increase is that poor families invest relatively less in children's early education than do wealthy families; therefore, their children attend lower-quality schools, which results in them being much less likely to participate in higher education. By simulating policy experiments for different types of government education expenditure, we find that direct subsidies to poor parents are the most efficient and effective policy for mitigating poor families' budget constraints with regard to early-education investment in their children.",
    "344": "Janet Yellen [2014] Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank, opened the 2014 Conference of Economic Opportunity and Inequality with observations that provide an essential underpinning for Putnam's important new book:The past several decades have seen the most sustained rise in inequality since the 19th century after more than 40 years of narrowing inequality following the Great Depression. By some estimates, income and wealth inequality are near their highest level in 100 years The past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority. I think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation's history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity. (pp. 1-2) Although Putnam acknowledges Yellen's description of current economic inequality, he is more interested in her question about its implications for our national emphasis on equality of opportunity. As a nation, we are less concerned with whether everyone gets to a similar place in the economic ladder than with whether everyone has the same chance to climb that ladder. Putnam's [2015] book attempts to address this belief by answering one basic question: ''Do youth today coming from different social and economic backgrounds in fact have roughly equal life chances, and has that changed in recent decades?'' ( emphasis in the original).Putnam's answer begins with a return to his home town, Port Clinton, Ohio, to compare the fates of several of his fellow class-of-'59 high school graduates with two more recent graduates. The differences are revealing. Several of his classmates, including two African American students, grew up in working-class families with high school (or less) educated parents. Yet, with the help from sport coaches, a wealthy employer, and other community figures, many of Putnam's classmates were able to graduate from college. By contrast, two more recent Port Clinton high school graduates followed paths that diverged almost at birth. The child of a more affluent local family became student council president, an honor society recipient, and attended a Big 10 university with the expectation of going to law school. In contrast, the other graduate grew up poor, had a father in prison, fathered a daughter by a former drug-addicted girlfriend, and, at the age of 21, saw no hope for the future. Putnam argues that these extreme stories capture fundamental changes that swept through his hometown and much of America in the past 50 years, changes that have profoundly divided the life opportunities of American children depending on their parents' educational status and social class. In Putnam's home county, for example, high-paying manufacturing jobs fell from 55 to 25% of all jobs in 30 years. Today, the average worker there makes 16% less than his or her grandparents (adjusted for inflation) and has ''not had a real raise for nearly a half century'' () Although the social consequences of these changes lagged the economic collapse somewhat, by 2010 unwed births, for example, doubled to nearly 40% and in less than 15 years (1999-2013) the child poverty rate jumped from 10 to 40% A key point of Putnam's book, however, is that the impact of these changes depended on when and exactly where in Port Clinton you grew up. In 1990, both Port Clinton and neighboring Catawba Island had child poverty rates under 5% By 2010, however, Port Clinton's child poverty rate increased to more than 40% and, for the more desirable lakeside Catawba Island, it was still below 5% (for two adjoining census tracts it was 51 and 1%) In little more than 20 years, residential segregation and other changes associated with class and education had radically transformed Putnam's home county and the face of much of America.How could changes of this magnitude happen in such a short time? And what do they mean for daily lives and futures of children on different sides of the growing American class divide? After setting the stage for these questions in his first chapter, ''The American Dream: Myths and Realities,'' Putnam provides some partial answers in four chapters titled ''Families,'' ''Parenting,'' ''Schooling,'' and ''Community.''The chapter on ''Schooling'' provides a compelling comparison of the high school experiences of children from two different Latino families, with one family living in a school district having a per capita income four times higher than the other family's district. Although mean spending per student and student-teacher ratios are comparable in both schools (but see below) adolescents in the poorer district were more likely to be truant (daily rates of 33 vs. 2%) to drop out (27 vs. 7%) and scored markedly lower on statewide tests (bottom 20 vs. top 10%) than their richer peers. As would be expected, the daily experiences of children from these two families mirrored these differences. Isabella (from the wealthier district) says, ''the only bad thing is you have to be in the top 10-12 percent. Getting Bs was considered failing'' () In contrast, when Lola is asked about the academics in her school, she simply replies, ''There wasn't any'' () Later in that chapter, parents - especially upper middle-class parents - are described as being quite aware of these sorts of differences. One cited study [] for example, found that houses near a public school with high standardized test scores sold for USD 200,000 more than comparable homes near low-scoring schools. Putnam concludes the chapter with research linking this housing cost differential to the same pattern of residential segregation that affected his home town of Port Clinton over the past 30 years.The seven figures included in the ''Schooling'' chapter, on their own, provide a schematic but especially revealing summary of current class disparities in educational opportunities. For example, compared to their higher income peers, low-income students nationally attend schools that offer 1/3 as many Advanced Placement classes, 1/2 as many sports teams, and, partly as a result, are 2/3 as likely to engage in school-based extracurricular activities. Not surprisingly, low-income students are then half as likely to attend college and 1/5 as likely to graduate from college by the age of 30 as their higher-income peers. As reported by Putnam [2015]:Even more shocking, high-scoring [based on standardized academic tests] poor kids are now slightly less likely (29 percent) to get a college degree than low-scoring rich kids (30 percent) This last fact is particularly hard to square with the idea at the heart of the American Dream: equality of opportunity. ()By the end of the ''Schooling'' chapter, it is obvious that Putnam believes economic and other societal inequalities over the past 30 plus years have profoundly altered poorer children's opportunities to achieve the American Dream. Continued economic inequality, whatever some Americans may believe, has changed the communities and the neighborhood schools children attend in ways that seem likely to permanently alter their life trajectories. But how did things get this way? Without some working answer to this question, it is difficult to know how to narrow the diverging trajectories of children from more and less affluent families. In chapters titled ''Parenting'' and ''Families,'' Putnam outlines some answers that hint at a major cultural debate in the United States. On one side are critics who argue that changing social and moral values have weakened parental investments in their children, and, on the other, are those who stress the role of recent structural and economic changes in diminishing equality of opportunity. For example, in his recent book The Road to Character, Brooks [2015] cites a continuing Gallup Poll that asks high school seniors whether they consider themselves ''to be a very important person.'' In 1950, 12% said yes, and by 2005, 80% said yes. The problem for children and the parents who raise them, Brooks suggests, is that cultural values in the past half century have shifted from humility, self-restraint and public mindedness to an obsession with fame, individuality, and self-expression. In contrast, economists like Krugman [2012] and Stiglitz [2015] focus on changes like the 2008 recession that bankrupted millions of Americans ''while in the first years of the recovery, some 95% of the increases in income went to the top 1%'' () This tension - character versus opportunity structure - is also implied in Putnam's chapter ''Families.'' In 1975, fewer than 20% of children were born to single mothers in the US, and this varied only somewhat by maternal educational level. By 2007, however, nonmarital births jumped to 65% for mothers with a high school education or less and about 10% for college-educated women. Moreover, 5 years after these nonmarital births, more than 2/3 of all women were no longer romantically involved with their children's fathers. And even when mothers did marry, high-school-educated mothers were twice as likely to get divorced as college-educated women (28 vs. 14%) Collectively, the magnitude of these changes has profoundly altered family structures and the developmental pathways of American children. Put simply, ''children who grow up without their biological father perform worse on standardized tests, earn lower grades, and stay in school for fewer years'' [ ] Explaining the origin of these changes is a complex and potentially contentious task, and Putnam's account attempts to straddle America's ''culture wars.'' Marriage 50s style, he says, involved: (1) a ''strongly patriarchal division of labor'' supported by a level of economic prosperity that allowed most families to live on a single, male income, and (2) a clear norm against ''out-of-wedlock births.'' The subsequent changes to marriage and family, he continues, happened for a variety of reasons, including the advent of the birth control pill, the reduction of economic opportunities for working-class males, an emerging individualist focus on self-fulfillment, and the increasing economic need and cultural support for women to enter the work place. As a result of these changes, Putnam continues, America has somehow fractured into three clearly defined and relatively equally sized class groups: those with at least a college degree, those with some college or vocational training, and those with a high school degree or less. As the three groups have lived through increasing residential, educational, and cultural segregation over the past 50 years, they have also become increasingly different in their parenting practices, family dynamics, and child outcomes. Moreover, as the bulk of Putnam's book makes clear, children from poorer families are doing worse than their wealthier peers by almost any standard that can be assessed. Putnam's description of the cultural and economic changes that led to increasing class/education-based divergences in marital and family patterns, however, are not very convincing. To be fair, this is not the primary focus of his book, and definitive explanations for these changes are still being debated. Still, it is not clear how recent historical changes, including better birth control, a more individualistic focus on self-fulfillment, and changes in women's roles, could drive the increasing divergence in children's opportunity structures as a function of parental education/class. For example, the cultural shifts that Brooks [2015] has recently described - purported declines in humility, self-restraint, and public mindedness - are by his description broad trends affecting most Americans and Western Europeans. Moreover, these are trends that do not differ in any obvious way by class and/or education. Why then are the economic and educational consequences of these supposedly shifting moral emphases so different for richer and poorer US children? Putnam has an answer, which unfortunately is never really developed in the book:Unemployment, underemployment, and poor economic prospects discourage and undermine stable relationships - that is the nearly universal finding of many studies, both qualitative and quantitative. A growing portion of women in the lower portion of the economic hierarchy are reluctant to marry men who can offer little or no economic security. ()This last quote is especially revealing in light of Nicholas Lemann's [2015] recent review of Putnam's book. After summarizing the clear descriptive strengths of Our Kids, Lemann argues that Putnam's overwhelming emphases on relative mobility and social capital as correctives for current inequalities are fundamentally wrongheaded. Lemann's critique begins with historical research [e.g. ] indicating that American mobility is mostly ''structural'' in nature. In other words, Americans have typically moved up or down economically in very large groups (absolute mobility) rather than by changing their individual positions within the economic ladder (relative mobility) Moreover, Putnam even acknowledges this pattern, ''Over the grand sweep of history, relative mobility accounts for only a small portion of total mobility experienced by generations, whereas absolute (structural) mobility accounts for most of it'' () What is puzzling, then, is how Putnam could be aware of these continued economic realities and yet devote the overwhelming bulk of his book to relative rather than absolute mobility. As Lemann [2015] puts it,If Putnam were more focused on absolute mobility, which was the real engine of the American Dream for his generation, then he might have spent more time exploring economic policy generally or ways of recreating the widely distributed economic growth that so much helped Americans his age. (pp. 26-27)It could be argued that there are already a number of excellent books on problems involving absolute mobility [e.g. ; ; ] and that Putnam is more interested in how these problems have affected American children and their prospects for the future. At this level, Our Kids provides a powerful and extremely troubling picture of the accelerating divergences between children from different social-class backgrounds. Putnam's division of American families into three roughly equally sized groups (college-educated, some college/vocational training, and high school or less) is clearly related to the increasing segregation of children's life trajectories at birth. But this is only one part of Putnam's book. It is when he turns to his second main interest - how to stop and reverse these patterns - that the weaknesses of the book become especially salient.The recent changes in ''social capital'' that Putnam refers to throughout his book - the activities and associations, and formal and informal social bonds that form the textures of daily life - are real and troubling. It is not just as Putnam [2000] argued in a previous book that more of us are ''bowling alone,'' but, as he describes in Our Kids, the time, money, and emotional energy for ''bowling'' are increasingly dependent on our class/educational backgrounds. Lemann's [2015] criticism, which I share, is that Putnam alternates in his causal explanations of the links between social capital and economic mobility. As noted above, in several sections of his book Putnam persuasively argues that: (a) massive economic changes have preceded disruptions in our social fabric and (b) changes in absolute rather than relative mobility are responsible for most of this disruption. Yet much of the book suggests that if we could only improve our social capital, the necessary social and economic changes would follow. In Lemann's [2015] words, Putnam ''is most intensely focused on increasing opportunity for individuals by increasing their locally available store of social capital - through improved ways of rearing children, and encouraging activities and associations that will increase their chance in life'' () This last criticism of Our Kids - that it often misunderstands the likely causal links between social capital, economic changes, and children's life opportunities - has its own potential difficulties. As Putnam argues, increasing poorer children's access to extracurricular activities, school and nonschool mentors, and high-quality community resources (e.g. parks, libraries, youth organizations) are important social goods on their own; goods that do not depend on their role in producing structural economic changes. Schools and schooling, however, play a more complex role in debates about possible causal links between structural economic changes and children's life opportunities, especially as educational status and social class have become more tightly connected. Many Americans put their hopes in the transformative power of educational institutions and innovations for addressing economic and societal inequalities. Yet, as Putnam [2015] Duncan and Murnane [2011] and numerous other researchers have described [see also for a brief review] children's educational opportunities in the United States depend on the specific schools they attend, and the quality of these schools is increasingly affected by ongoing patterns of economic and residential segregation. The good news is that researchers and educators are developing an increasingly fine-tuned understanding of how to improve the educational experiences and performance of children and adolescents from poorer communities [see, e.g. ] The bad news is that it is unclear whether Americans have the political will to make the necessary educational changes or whether those changes, on their own, can halt or slow the growth of inequalities in our children's life opportunities. Putnam [2015] began his book by saying he saw his hometown change from a passable embodiment of the American dream [to] a community in which kids from the wrong side of the tracks that bisect town can barely imagine the future that awaits the kids from the right side of the tracks. And the story of Port Clinton turns out sadly to be typical of America. How this transformation happened, why it matters, and how we might begin to alter the cursed state of our society is subject of this book. ()By its conclusion, Our Kids has provided vivid and disturbing answers to the first two questions while also beginning to address policy debates about how to alter our ''cursed state.'' It is a book that will appeal to everyone concerned with increasing inequality and its accelerating impact on American children's diverging life trajectories.",
    "345": "This paper provides a framework for estimating intergenerational mobility elasticities (IGE) of childrens income with respect to parental income. We allow the IGEs to be heterogeneous, by leaving the relationship of parental and child incomes unspecified, while acknowledging and addressing the latent nature of both child and parental permanent incomes and the resulted life-cycle bias. Our framework enables us to test the widely imposed assumption that the intergenerational mobility function is linear. Applying our method to the Panel Studies of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, we decisively reject the commonly imposed linearity assumption and find substantial heterogeneity in the IGEs across the population. We confirm an important finding that the IGEs with respect to parental income exhibit a U-shape pattern, which is occasionally highlighted in the analysis using transition matrices. Specifically, there is a considerable degree of mobility among the broadly defined middle class, but the children of both high- and low-income parents are more likely to be high- and low-income adults, respectively. This result also provides insights into the (intertemporal) Great Gatsby curve, suggesting that a higher level of inequality within one generation may lead to a higher level of social immobility in the next generation in the U.S.",

    "347": "Intergenerational earnings mobility is analyzed in a model where human capital is produced using schooling and parental time. In steady states more mobile societies have less inequality, but in the short run higher mobility may result from an increase in inequality. Starting from the same inequality, mobility is higher under public than under private education. A rise in income shocks, for example due to increased returns to ability, or a switch from public to private schooling both increase inequality. However, increased shocks raise mobility in the short run and do not affect it in the long run, whereas an increased role for private schooling reduces mobility in both the short and long run. That these differences may help to identify the source of changes in inequality, and other realworld implications, are illustrated in a brief discussion of time trends and crosscountry differences.",

We provide some comparative statics results considering different levels of intergenerational mobility. After, we allow interaction among families in credit markets within the same income class and within all families in the economy. A trivial welfare analysis shows that when frictionless markets are available, a Pareto superior outcome is feasible. Then we introduce a benevolent government that taxes families purely on redistributive purposes and compare the policy implied outcome with one associated to available credit markets. In our model framework the government cannot replicate competitive allocation.",
    "349": "We examine how intergenerational income mobility responds to structural changes in a simple theoretical model of intergenerational transmission, deviating from the existing literature by explicitly analyzing the transition path between steady states. We find that mobility depends not only on current but also on past transmission mechanisms, such that changing policies, institutions or economic conditions may generate long-lasting trends. Variation in mobility levels across countries may thus be partly explained by differences in former institutions; current mobility trends may be caused by institutional changes in the past.We further find that transitions between steady states tend to be non-monotonic. Changes in the relative returns to different skills or a shift towards a less plutocratic and more meritocratic economy raise mobility initially, but also generate a negative trend over subsequent generations. Times of change thus tend to be times of high mobility, and declining mobility today may not reflect a recent deterioration of equality of opportunity but rather major improvements made in the past.",
    "350": "This paper adds maternal employment and income to a traditional intergenerational income elasticity model to measure mothers effects on transmission of economic status from parents to children. Assuming that mothers have a specific role in perpetuating the human capital and income-generating behavior of a family, I examine the intergenerational transmission of economic status using regression analysis in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics on individuals born between 1950 and 1974. My results suggest that while the income of fathers is very important in accounting for sons and daughters future outcomes, the amount of time parents stay at home or are unemployed also affects intergenerational transmission of economic status for daughters. Specifically, daughters experience a positive role model effect on their future income if mothers are employed during their childhood while fathers time spent employed negatively impacts daughters income. The interaction model testing maternal employment on transmission of income from father to daughter does have tentative positive results.

To make these types of programmes effective, two important issues must be considered. First, the returns on human capital have to be positive and sufficiently high. Although there is important evidence that this is the case for education, less conclusive evidence exists for health in general and Mexico in particular. Because health capital may reflect aspects of productivity different from labour specialisation (that are related to education) it is important to have positive returns on health investments (that is, not only human capital in general) In addition, these investments will increase development only if social mobility is feasible, as human capital returns implied that increasing human capital would then result in increased labour income and thus mobility that would represent development. This study attempts to provide a better understanding of the importance of mobility in Mexican society. In this analysis, using data from a national representative survey, I found that the returns on health in Mexico are positive and at an order of magnitude similar to those reported for other countries. I also found that social mobility is present, although there is still an important intergenerational transmission of educational attainments.",
    "352": "Traditional measures of inter-generational mobility such as the inter-generational elasticity are not useful for inferences concerning group differences in mobility with respect to the pooled income distribution. This paper uses transition probabilities and measures of directional rank mobility that can identify inter-racial differences in inter-generational mobility. The study uses two data sources including one that contains social security earnings for a large inter-generational sample. I find that recent cohorts of blacks are not only significantly less upwardly mobile but also significantly more downwardly mobile than whites. This implies a steady-state distribution in which there is no racial convergence in income. A descriptive analysis using co-variates reveals that test scores in adolescence can explain much of the racial difference in both upward and downward mobility. Family structure can account for some of the racial gap in upward mobility but not downward mobility. Completed schooling and parental wealth also appear to account for some of the racial gaps in inter-generational mobility.",

Our test is based on the supremum of a rescaled U-statistic. We show that its asymptotic distribution is Gumbel. The proof is difficult because the approximating Gaussian stochastic process contains both a stationary and a nonstationary part, and so we have to extend existing results that only apply to either one or the other case. We also propose a refinement to the asymptotic approximation that we show works much better in finite samples. We apply our test to the study of intergenerational income mobility.",

The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility. Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press: 2014: xxi + 384 pp. ISBN 978-0691162546, $29.95 (cloth); 978-0691168371, $19.95 (paper) Many of capitalism's defenders argue that capitalism, despite its inevitable (and often extreme) inequality, is essentially \"fair\" because it provides each of us with the opportunity\"a fair chance\"to succeed. Class, status, and income mobility are possible for those who make the right choices. Efforts to measure mobility have typically looked at economic and social outcomes for individuals relative to those of their parents. How likely, for example, is a person born in the bottom quintile of the income distribution to rise to the middle quintile, or the top quintile? [End Page 197] How strong is the correlation between the social statuses (measured variously) of fathers and sons? A strong correlation suggests that social mobility is limitedyour life chances depend on \"where you come from\" more than \"merit.\" Recent studies of this sort generally conclude that (a) status at birth is a key determinant of one's status in adulthood (mobility is limited); (b) mobility varies across capitalist countries, and (c) countries with relatively equal distributions of income (e.g. Sweden, Norway, Denmark) tend to enjoy higher rates of mobility. Gregory Clark's The Son Also Rises is an impressive, nervy and, ultimately, troubling book that challenges widely held ideas about the extent and determinants of mobility. Clark is persuaded that his book challenges conventional wisdom on mobility in some very essential ways. Clark argues persuasively that studies that look at data over just one generation tend to overstate the degree of social mobility. To move beyond the limitations of this literature (and the data on which it is based) Clark traces over time the fortunes of families with unusual surnames, to see how members of these families fareusing various markers of economic and social successover several generations. He undertakes this exercise using data from several countries: Sweden, US, England, India, China, Chile, Japan and Korea, among others. Clark's research suggests that families tend to retain their status to a remarkable extent over many generations\"regression to the mean\" is slow. In each of his several case studies, Clark concludes that surnames associated with \"high status\" several generations ago continue to be \"over-represented\" among elites. Similarly, those with surnames that were of \"low status\" several generations ago are disproportionately of low status. Clark discovers, for example, that Swedes with historically elite surnames continue to be over-represented in high status professions (physicians, lawyers, university professors) Similarly, rare surnames associated with high status in early nineteenth century England continue to be associated with high status today. People with these surnames are, e.g. much wealthier than average, and they are over-represented among recent Oxford and Cambridge students by a factor of six. Clark's clever techniquefollowing surnames over timeprovides some fascinating and persuasive stories about the durability of social status across generations. But, unfortunately, this isn't enough for Professor Clark. Clark concludesfrom his compelling but less-than-conclusive datathat there is a \"law of mobility,\" a law that holds across time and across societies. \"This book suggeststhere is a universal constant of intergenerational correlation of 0.75, from which deviations are rare\" () That is, rates of social mobility in twenty-first century Sweden, Medieval England, the twentieth century U.S. and nineteenth century Japan are essentially the same. [End Page 198] Culture, social institutions, discrimination, government policies have little effect. Indeed, the \"rate of persistence\" (the tendency for families to retain their social status over time) is just \"a little higher for the feudal England of the Middle Ages than for the progressive, equality-loving, social-democratic Sweden of today\" () Why is mobility so limited, according to Clark? Our social and economic prospects are governed, overwhelmingly, by \"underlying social capabilities,\" courtesy of our families. And why are some families blessed with abundant \"social capabilities,\" while others must make do with less.",

The literatures on education and income mobility reveal a similar ranking with South America, other developing nations, southern European countries and France tending to have rather limited mobility although the Nordic countries exhibit strong mobility. Estimates of mobility based on social class point to rather different patterns, and we demonstrate that these differences are most likely generated by intergenerational earnings persistence within social classes. The second part of the paper looks for explanations for the differences in earnings and education persistence and finds that mobility is negatively correlated with inequality and the return to education but positively correlated with a nation's education spending.",

It is shown that experiencing higher inequality in childhood has a negative effect on intergenerational mobility as adults.

We propose an endogenous growth model with occupational choice and an endogenous supply of teachers and education quality. We show that endogenous school quality alters the shape of those relationships in a way that has new policy implications. First, growth depends on the level of public education expenditures and on the shape of the human capital distribution. Second, the relationship between public education and inequality can be either positive or negative. Calibrating our model to US state data, we find that a significant share of states faces a trade-off between increasing growth and decreasing inequality through public education spending. We find that this trade-off is overall more likely in states with higher public education expenditures, teacher employment share and relative wage, and intergenerational mobility. Finally, the existence of such a trade-off depends on how public education spending is financed.",

We measure social mobility with intergenerational income elasticities, Associations between fathers and sons income percentiles, and brother correlations. All approaches suggest that social mobility increased substantially between cohorts born in the early 1930s and the early 1940s. Father-son associations remained stable for cohorts born after WWII, while brother correlations continued to decline. The relationship between fathers and sons income percentile ranks is highly nonlinear for the early cohorts, but approaches linearity over time.

Studies of such intergenerational persistence, or lack of intergenerational mobility, are concerned with measuring the strength of the relationship between parents socio-economic status and that of their children as adults.

Using administrative registers allow us to look at small fractions of the populations, i.e. dynasties, and to distinguish between sons and daughters and to observe their eventual spouses' incomes. We find that intergenerational mobility is lower in the top, in particular, when including capital income in the total income. Also we find the marriage match has a stronger impact on the family-to-family income transfer in the top of the income distribution where the daughter marries a man more like her father than herself. The highest persistence, however, is between first- and second-generation households, especially between father and mother's aggregated incomes and that of their son and daughter-in-law's with a correlation close to a half.",

Educationists are confounded by its reporting that school quality has little effect on student performance schools produce good students because they select good students. Sociologists are shaken by the report that the family in the USA has a small effect on the incomes of children and that there is little inheritance of economic status although incomes vary widely. A highly inegalitarian society operates somewhat randomly. Economists are bewildered to discover that educational and occupational levels are little related to income, making a shamble of their favored activity of calculating the rate of return on educational expenditures. Great Society/Fabian social policy analysts are told that education won't produce social mobility for those at the bottom; even if it did, social mobility is an ineffective goal, for high rates of upward mobility do not reduce the range of differences in income. Little progress is taking place, except for Blacks. If you want to redistribute income -and that is a desirable goal to Jencks and his associates then redistribute income; don't rely on education and other indirect mechanisms to do the job. Results that are incompatible with beliefs make methodologists of the most unsophisticated in order to quiz the procedures which produce the disturbing results. Since the book is based on reanalysis and synthesis of data collected in other people's earlier studies, it is more clearly than most social research, an exercise in detection rather than induction. While references are made to the quality of data and more references to test errors, I felt that there was an overassurance in the data. Appendix B on Path Models of Intergenerational Mobility, combining a variety of sources into a systematic, detailed and definitivesounding accounting of factors in mobility, was less than overwhelmirng in building my confidence in the methodology of this very significant and beautifully written book.

But this belief has never been verified byempirical data of a nation-wide research.

About two thousand questionnaireswere mailed in to graduates of two middle schools and two vocationalschools in Osaka; 970 of them were collected and were analysed. The resultsare as follows:1.The occupational and educational status of the respondents' fathers arehigher than that of the average of that time.

    "366": "Racial disparity in family incomes remained remarkably stable over the past 40 years in the United States despite major legal and social reforms. Previous scholarship presents two primary explanations for persistent inequality through a period of progressive change. One highlights continuity: because socioeconomic status is transmitted from parents to children, disparities created through histories of discrimination and opportunity denial may dissipate slowly. The second highlights change: because family income results from joining individual earnings in family units, changing family compositions can offset individuals changing economic chances. I examine whether black-white family income inequality trends are better characterized by the persistence of existing disadvantage (continuity) or shifting forms of disadvantage (change) I combine cross-sectional and panel analysis using Current Population Survey, Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Census, and National Vital Statistics data. Results suggest that African Americans experience relatively extreme intergenerational continuity (low upward mobility) and discontinuity (high downward mobility); both helped maintain racial inequality. Yet, intergenerational discontinuities allow new forms of disadvantage to emerge. On net, racial inequality trends are better characterized by changing forms of disadvantage than by continuity. Economic trends were equalizing but demographic trends were disequalizing; as family structures shifted, family incomes did not fully reflect labor-market gains.",
    "367": "Being born into a lligh status family confers an early advantage in school and when first getting a job and these advantages have enduring consequences. In addition, it confers a further advantage in mid-career. I propose that some of the early advantages stem from parents' wealth and other economic resources and that most of the advantage in mid-career is from these resources. I predict that the effects will be larger in less-developed societies and in societies where economic resources are more unequally distributed. New re sults on a precapitalist tribal society, on a very poor and predom inantly peasant society, and on cities in nine Latin American societies at different levels of development support this theory. Being born into a high st'l:tus family is an enduring advantage. It helps in school and when first getting a job; bo.th have lasting consequences on a man's career. But that is not all: even in the middle of a career, it confers a fresh advantage, in addition to its early benefits and their later consequences. This puzzling advantage appears, as Bernard and Renaud! have shown, under the disparate guises of 'counter-mobility'2 and 'lagged effects' of father's occupation,3 and Bernard and Renaud present a new and interesting theory about it. In this paper I propose some modifications to their theory and also extend it, arguing that lagged effects should be larger in some types of society than in others. Bernard and Renaud and others have shown that family background exerts a small, but real, lagged effect in two advanced industrial soci eties and since such societies appear to have similar stratification sys tems, 4 this is probably true in others as well. But nothing is known about less-developed industrial societies or about pre-industrial societies.

It is well known that the new Meiji government endevored to dissolve the discrimination based on feudal estate system and more than ninety percent of the total population was made to be equal, social as well as legally, although not economically, within a relatively short time. However, our nation-wide sample survey of 1965, which offers us for the first time after 1904 figures concerning to population distribution of Samurai descendants and commoners, revealed that substantial difference between Samurai descendants and commoners still exists. The proportion of Samurai descendants occupying the higher position in occupation, education, and income is larger than that of commoners, although the differences are smaller in the present generation than in the preceding ones. Why does social superiority, although not outstanding, of Samurai descendants still exist after one handred years since legal discrimination was abolished ? The answer would be divided into two parts. The first part of my answer is that any revolutionary social change cannot entirely destory the old social class structure immediately, and this might be applied to the Meiji Restoration. Let us assume that intergenerational mobility makes a Markov chain with two stages, high and low statuses : and that the above transition probability matrix P works commonly in Samurai descendants and in commoners after modern revolution like the Meiji Restoration. It is demonstrated according to the property of the regular Markov chain that if the proportion of an estate occupying the higher position is larger than that of the other estates in the initial stage of a Markov chain, the difference does not vanish within a few stages, although it reaches null after enough many stages.The second part of the answer is that the transition probability matrix P is not common in Samurai descendants and in commoners, but the matrix is more advantageous for Samurai descendants than for commoners. Our sample survey conducted in 1964 in Tokyo revealed percentages of mobility-oriented responses to various kinds of attitude questions and scales by the distinction of Samurai descendants and commoners, taking account of the influence from present occupation. One can say through sign test that Samurai descendants are statistically significantly more mobility-oriented than commoners.",

A thick upper tail of the stationary distribution of wealth is shown to emerge as a robust prediction, irrespective of (1) the presence of multidimensional (wealth and ability) heterogeneity and non-convexities in human capital formation, and (2) the nature of parental bequest motives (joy-of-giving vs. paternalism) Additionally, (3) we identify conditions under which the unique, ergodic wealth distribution exhibits a mass point at the bottom of its support, where credit market imperfections continue to affect, along the convergence process, the structure of wealth transitions at the lineage level. Motivated by these results, we then analyze the sensitivity of the left tail to various frictions and fiscal instruments that affect bequest strategies and the ensuing transmission of wealth across generations. In particular, capital income or bequest taxes with no redistribution may reinforce economic mechanisms underpinning mobility traps in the left tail, thereby increasing the persistence of households in the lowest tiers of the wealth distribution.",

Using data from the General Social Survey (GSS) it is possible to provide evidence on this question, evidence that is suggestive but must be carefully interpreted because the samples are relatively small. The GSS data reveal an increase in class reproduction among young and middle-age adults that is driven by the growing advantage of the professional-managerial class relative to all other classes. This trend is largely consistent with our new top-income hypothesis that posits that rising income inequality registers its effects on social mobility almost exclusively in the divide between the professional-managerial class and all other classes. We develop a two-factor model in which the foregoing effects of the inequality takeoff are set against the countervailing effects of the expansion of mass education. As the model implies, the trend in intergenerational association takes on a convex shape in the younger age groups, with the change appearing to accelerate in the most recent decade. These results suggest that the takeoff in income inequality may account in part for the decline in mobility.",

The contribution of the individual characteristic differences of the offspring to the offspring income gap between the sectors outside of the system and the collective economic sectors is more than 65%,while to the offspring income gap between the sectors within the system and the two other sectors is only less than 50% Meanwhile, the contribution of the degree difference and the individual characteristics of the intergenerational income mobility to the income gap has different expressions at different positions of the offspring income distribution.",

Excluding these countries (five of which have populations of less than 5 million and most of which are in Southern Africa) and controlling for country-level income, Africa has consumption inequality levels comparable to developing countries in other parts of the world. And inequality is not systemically increasing in Africa. This traditional approach to studying inequality, a focus on the country Gini index, misses out on a range of other ways one can view inequality. And the picture that emerges taking these other approaches is even more complex. Looking at inequality through persistence in intergenerational education and occupation, the study finds less persistence for children born in recent years than older generations. But mobility is still low, which perpetuates inequality. In other words, the son of a farmer is highly likely to be a farmer himself when he grows up.",

The author calculated the contribution of education,health and occupation to intergenerational correlation with intergenerational data from CHNS. The consistent results show occupation occupies first place,followed by education and health. The further analysis of cohort suggests that the three observable channels of transmission are more convincing for poor family,education is more and more important and the analysis of father-son is typical. The implication is the equal access to the labor market and the equalization of education resource are helpful to intergenerational mobility.",
    "394": "This paper investigates how the system of government grants affected individual life chances for students in the Netherlands from 1815 to today, focusing on the accessibility of academic education and opportunities for social mobility. Study grants for adolescents from lower class or low-income families can promote upward intergenerational social mobility, since they remove the financial barriers of continuing education and can lead to occupations of a higher standing. By investigating the social background and careers of a sample of grant students compared to the overall student populations, this paper uncovers to what extent study grants had an effect on an individual and societal scale. During the two centuries under study the aims and size of the grant system changed, causing concerns about the effectiveness of the grants. In the entire nineteenth century grants for university students were restricted to those already enrolled, minimizing the appeal for newcomers from low-income families. The limited number of grants available prevented the system from influencing the composition of the student population fundamentally. However, this changed when the grant system was extended in 1919, and again after 1945 when grant allocation was connected to parental income level. The rapid increase of educational participation and connected democratisation from the 1960s made the grant system influential, however costly. The grant system has been a subject of ongoing political debate during the last few decades, since the grants effect on upward social mobility has been called into question.",
    "395": "We show that the patterns of intergenerational earnings mobility in Denmark, Finland and Norway, unlike those for the US and the UK, are highly nonlinear. The Nordic relationship between log earnings of sons and fathers is flat in the lower segments of the fathers' earnings distribution - sons growing up in the poorest households have the same adult earnings prospects as sons in moderately poor households - and is increasingly positive in middle and upper segments. This convex pattern contrasts sharply with our findings for the US and the UK, where the relationship is much closer to being linear. As a result, cross-country comparisons of intergenerational earnings elasticities may be misleading with respect to transmission mechanisms in the central parts of the earnings distribution and uninformative in the tails of the distribution. It is now a stylised fact that intergenerational earnings mobility is higher in the Nordic welfare-state economies than in more market-oriented economies such as the US; see, e.g. Bj6rklund and and To a large extent, this knowledge rests on between-country comparisons of either the elasticity of child income with",

The main difference across birth-year cohorts is that younger subjects tend to live in smaller households, with lower total annual household expenditures (and fewer durable goods) though per capita measures are similar across cohorts. This appears to be related to life-cycle fertility patterns. There is a clear positive association between parental socioeconomic status (SES) and current levels of expenditure and durable goods ownership. This association does not hold for all households, however, as there is both upward and downward mobility in the sample. Those living in the capital have the highest overall wealth levels, consistent with typical rural-urban patterns. Where there are expenditure differences across groups, they tend to be driven by differences in nonfood rather than food expenditures. Lastly, the study sample is relatively well off compared with their compatriots, with a poverty rate of 35% and an extreme poverty rate of only 3% against national averages of 56% and 15% respectively.",

I hypothesise that based on the psychological mechanism of self-serving bias in causal attribution, those who experience upward social mobility are more likely to support greater income differences, and that subjective intergenerational mobility has stronger association with attitudes towards income differences than objective mobility because individuals filter their objective environment in order to derive their subjective perceptions of the world and their own experiences. The described hypotheses are tested with two cross-national data sets European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings are robust to alternative statistical specifications and indicate that individuals who perceive themselves as subjectively mobile have significantly different attitudes towards income differences in comparison to non-mobile groups, but that this effect does not manifest among objectively mobile individuals.",

The Left talked about access and equity. The Right talked about opportunity. Governments of all stripes spent trillions of dollars to increase social mobility. The lesson of Gregory Clark's fascinating book is that it was all pointless. Social mobility is no greater in the West today than it was in medieval England. Upward mobility in Sweden today is no better than in the eighteenth century. Nor is it better in contemporary Sweden than in the United States. The wealth of East Asia exploded in the past half-century. Modernity came to Asia aggressively. But this had relatively little impact on who climbed up or slid down the social ladder. Neither huge spending on higher education nor even mass-scale totalitarian murder of millions made a difference. All government schemes to increase social mobility end in failure.",

    "400": "Equality of opportunity is a notion rooted in many societies as a conception of importance. The idea that ones life chances ought to be unrelated to the aspects of ones background upon which one has no say, such as the material wealth of ones parents, is generally one that is widely held. The term Intergenerational income mobility, describing, as it does, the interrelatedness of the incomes of parents with those of their children, is thus too a conception of some importance. Recent studies, looking at cross-sectional income inequality across a range of primarily advanced nations, have established a link between income inequality and intergenerational income mobility, suggesting that countries with high income inequality tend also to exhibit lower rates of mobility. With there existing increased attention upon wealth in recent times, and the importance of its magnitude and unequal distribution, this paper sets out to discern the nature of the relationship between wealth as another marker of material well-being and intergenerational income mobility, in high- low- and middle-income countries. Using mediating factors, state type and the wealth-income ratio, this study finds that wealth inequality is negatively correlated with intergenerational income mobility in high-income countries, and that the results for low- and middle-income countries are, as yet, unclear.

Users may add a fourth class to specify any possible IGM index not included in igmobil. Standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated using a bootstrap procedure. Users can customize many aspects of the program output, including the type and dimension of the transition matrix, the parameters for some IGM indices (like the ones involving generalized entropy measures and the Atkinson index) and how standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated.",

Quantile regression and OLS based results suggest there is moderate level of \"stickiness\" in income mobility across generations. Sons are found to be more mobile than daughters both in monetary and non-monetary terms, although the mobility gap appears to have narrowed recently. There is virtually no evidence on intergenerational mobility in the context of low income countries in general and Sub-Saharan Africa in particular. The paper thus provides valuable insights into issues of intergenerational mobility in a low income country setting. The mixed approach used addresses possible measurement error in income, as well as offering a broader scope in examining intergenerational mobility.",

We argue that previous estimates of income mobility conceal the heterogeneous nature of the transmission mechanism by keeping mobility constant across families. The striking differences we find between mobility patterns across family backgrounds, captured by father's education, lead us to question the conventional result that intergenerational transmission of earnings is weaker in Sweden than in the United States, for important parts of the population.",

Fatherson associations remained stable for cohorts born after World War II, while brother correlations continued to decline. The relationship between father and son income percentile ranks is highly nonlinear for early cohorts, but it approaches linearity over time. We discuss increasing educational attainment among low and middleincome families as a possible mechanism underlying these trends.",

We then evaluate Clarks use of surname between-group persistence as a preferred measure of intergenerational mobility in the book The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility. We show that aggregate surname-level intergenerational persistence cannot be compared with individual persistence because group-level income averages captures diverse individual-level and group-level factors impossible to disentangle without additional identifying information. Furthermore, measures of group persistence do not address the problem of measurement error leading to attenuation bias, which is Clarks rationale to study surname mobility. An empirical example partitioning the population into groups based on racial/ethnic origins and a simulation clarify the relationship between these different measures of mobility.",

This could inhibit social mobility, exacerbate the intergenerational transmission of wealth and deepen housing inequality. Although research shows that parental socio-economic advantage is associated with filial homeownership, less is known about whether these relationships are particularly pronounced in expensive housing markets where access to homeownership is often more constrained. This study tests this hypothesis by enriching the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study of England and Wales with data on local transactional house prices. Multilevel models indicate that disparities in the odds of homeownership between young adults with more and less socio-economically advantaged parents tend to deepen with increasing house prices. This pattern is most noticeable for women. However, parents and prices only intersect to greatly stratify the probability of homeownership when young adults circumstances are otherwise conducive to owning.",

Elasticity estimates vary depending on the level of occupational (dis)aggregation and earnings measure used: they are highest when twodigit level occupations and hourly earnings are used, and lowest when fourdigit level occupations and annual earnings are used. We read these findings as indicating that elasticity estimates are sensitive to the use of different data and methods, and researchers should be careful when undertaking crossstudy, crosstemporal or crossnational comparisons.",

We first estimate a fixed effects model that is identified by analyzing families who move across counties with children of different ages. We then use these fixed effect estimates to (i) quantify how much places matter for intergenerational mobility, (ii) construct forecasts of the causal effect of growing up in each county that can be used to guide families seeking to move to opportunity, and (iii) characterize which types of areas produce better outcomes. For children growing up in low-income families, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (std. dev.) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5% There is substantial variation in counties causal effects even within metro areas. Counties with less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates tend to produce better outcomes for children in poor families. Boys outcomes vary more across areas than girls outcomes, and boys have especially negative outcomes in highly segregated areas. Areas that generate better outcomes have higher house prices on average, but our approach uncovers many opportunity bargainsplaces that generate good outcomes but are not very expensive.",

Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) we study inequality in three dimensions, focusing on the conjoint distributions of income, consumption, and wealth for the same individuals. We find that the trends in inequality in income, consumption, and wealth similarly increase between 1999 and 2013. We examine the pairwise distributions of our measures using the average propensity to consume and the wealth-income ratios. Using the longitudinal nature of the PSID, we follow people over this period and find mobility is similar using income, consumption and wealth. We conclude that while all three types of inequality are rising, wealth increasingly acts as a buffer to cushion income changes, which could reduce mobility - both intra- and inter-generational mobility.",

I find that partners have a substantial role in generating family income persistence for daughters, with a strong association between husbands earnings and parental income in both cohorts. For sons I find a striking change. In the first cohort there is no link between sons wives earnings and parental income; in the second cohort this is as strong as the relationship between parents and sons- in- law. Consequently, when I add partners earnings to the story I find that the change in mobility for sons is even stronger than when it is measured on individual earnings.",

    "413": "For nearly a hundred years, and probably longer, a popular take on social class and wealth embraced the trope \"The rich get rich and the poor get poorer.\" 1 In response to the wide variation in economic status largely believed to be the result of urbanization and industrialization, twentieth-century reformers and activists worked, lobbied, marched, and legislated to close the gap between the haves and the have-nots.Acting on the premise that a rising tide raises all ships, private philanthropy and all levels of government assessed needs and conceptualized new institutional providers in support of women and children.A multitude of programs focused on education, healthcare, social services, and housing reform to address inequality of income.Gregory Clark, professor of economics at the University of California, Davis, upends the notion that interventions such as these can effect substantive change in his most recent book, The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility.In a fascinating and extraordinary use of historical data, Clark and his 11 collaborators, including Neil Cummins, Yu Hao, and Daniel Diaz, creatively correlate surnames with wealth, educational attainment, and class in Europe, Asia, and North and South America.His focus encompasses historic periods ranging from the eleventh-century Norman invasion of England to the 300-year Qing (Manchu) dynasty in China .In contrast to the short-term, two-generation study of wealth and class typically employed by sociologists, Clark utilizes the longue dure approach of the French Annales School with a multiple-generational analysis of wealth and some studies lasting up to 17 generations.For readers who are neither statisticians, economists, nor sociologists, the Introduction to The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility provides the context for understanding the issue of economics and social mobility in the ruling and underclasses.The chapters that follow are neatly divided into three sections: Social Mobility by Time and Place, Testing the Laws of Mobility, and The Good Society.This three-part structure details the studies and the findings, presents and explains Clark's theory of social mobility, and then explores the anomalies and future implications for social policy.Two of the three appendices detail how to utilize data to examine multiple-generational mobility, derive rates of persistence and evaluate surname frequencies.The third appendix is a guide to teasing out the status of your own surname lineage.The book concludes with complete sources for the data used in the figures and tables, followed by an extensive reference section and index.While social competence is generally understood to be a multidimensional concept that includes social, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral skills, Clark argues that measures of education, wealth, and income are a viable proxy for social competence.He further argues that his measures of social competence are assets more powerful than any social intervention, cultural shift, or economic opportunity (108-113).Clark contends that interventions which promote equal opportunity have not resulted in greater equality, and a better and more democratic approach might be a focus on greater equality of condition.While some may quarrel with his explanation of how nature versus nurture plays a role in social mobility, the argument that creating greater equality is a better path to social mobility than traditional institutional interventions should provoke interesting discussions.",

The current study rectifies this important omission for rural India, and develops strategies that will be useful for similar research in other developing countries. Using a panel dataset spanning 1994-2012, I find that the intergenerational income persistence for rural India is lower than analogous evidence from other developing countries. However, the between-groups coefficient of 0.74, which is corroborated by repeated cross-sections from the National Sample Survey, indicates that India is progressing towards cross-caste equality, but at a disappointingly slow rate.",

There are substantial income differences between graduates from different family backgrounds that can be observed both four and 10 years after graduation.

The argument developed in this critical note proposes both a historical reading of the ideology of intergenerational equity, which is only conceivable in the transition from the Trente Glorieuses to the Trente Piteuses and a structural reading arguing that, for the wealthy classes during the European Old Regime, successful transfers of wealth between generations followed the same formal requirements as those in the twenty-first century.",
    "417": "A college education has been linked to higher life-time earnings and better economic achievements, so the expectation would be that it is also linked to higher net wealth for everybody.However, recent analyses challenge this hypothesis and find that the expectation holds true for White college-educated households but not for Black college-educated households.To examine this finding further and investigate the role of family financial transfers in household net wealth, the authors perform a mixed-method study using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for a 24-year period, 1989-2013, and qualitative data from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy Levering Mobility study.Their results confirm that White college-educated households amass wealth, whereas the wealth of their Black counterparts declines.The authors also estimate the impact of just inheritance or large financial gifts and find that they decrease the existing racial wealth gap by nearly $40,000, or 20 percent.Further analyses demonstrate that White college graduates are significantly and substantially more likely to provide and receive financial support for education and/or a home purchase, while Black college graduates are significantly more likely to financially support their parents.Multivariate regression analysis identifies receipt of financial support for education and a home purchase as a positive contributor to net wealth and financial help for parents as a negative contributor to net wealth, disadvantaging Black college-educated households, who are less likely to receive and more likely to give financial support.Longitudinal interview data collected in the Institute on Assets and Social Policy Leveraging Mobility study illustrate the mechanisms of family financial transfers and their relationship to wealth accumulation, contrasting the White and Black households' experiences.The discussion underscores the need to better understand intergenerational wealth and wealth sharing within families when studying wealth outcomes and highlights the role of family financial wealth transfers in creating opportunities for those who benefit the most-mostly White college-educated households.(",
    "418": "Author(s): Koppera, Vedant | Advisor(s): Kuhn, Peter J. | : In this work I present three essays related to the rising number of female college graduates relative to men, intergenerational mobility in education, and the prevalence of overeducated workers during the great recession. In the first chapter co-authored with Associate Professor Aashish Mehta (UC Santa Barbara) we ask whether shifting male and female employment patterns can help to explain why the US college boom between 1981 and 2005 was dominated by women. We make three contributions. First, we show that while a massive feminization of high-wage, high-skill occupations plausibly contributed to the female college boom, general, structural movements of labor (undifferentiated by gender) from industrial work into education-intensive services should have encouraged male rather than female college attendance. Previous work has suggested that both types of employment shifts would have contributed to the female college boom. Second, we show that womens occupational upgrading was too large and ubiquitous to be explained by their growing educational advantage. This is consistent with a causal connection running from gendered employment trends to a female college boom. Third, we show that gender specializations in many occupations deepened, with college educated women gravitating towards jobs offering institutionally protected wages.In the second chapter, I estimate the intergenerational transmission of education in the United States between 1980 and 2013. I find that intergenerational persistence in education has increased substantially among blacks in recent years while remaining stable among whites and Hispanics. I observe this trend when using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics as well as the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth. I demonstrate that much of the increase in educational persistence among blacks is due to decreases in upward mobility. The increase in black educational persistence is found in both two-parent and single-parent households, and I do not find similar trends and differences when estimating intergenerational income persistence.In the third and final chapter, I use the method introduced by to analyze the rate of overeducation among workers with exactly a college degree between 2006 and 2013. To my knowledge, this is the first study to use this method to analyze trends in overeducation during the great recession in the U.S. I find that the proportion of workers with exactly a college degree working in occupations offering low college premiums increased during great recession and fell afterwards. An increase in the rate in overeducation could be due to more college-educated workers working in noncollege occupations that were noncollege in the past or because there was an increase in the number of noncollege occupations. I show that changes in the rate of overeducation are mostly due mostly to the latter. When shutting the down the flexibility for occupations to change from college to noncollege (and vice versa) the rate of overeducation increases only slightly between 2006 and 2013. Regardless, these findings run contrary to the secular decline of the rate of overeducation during the end of 20th century documented by previous research.",

In the line with Markov Chain Theory, in this paper, we provide estimates for intergenerational mobility, which is measured in terms of probabilities. We believe that the social mobility as many other natural and social science process can be represented by Markov matrices. The results from this study show that after 7 generations the distribution has converged to its stationary point. Meaning, if there is no policy initiative to shift the intergeneration immobility; UK will remain with distribution showing inequality and different opportunities for the young generations depending on their parental background. In addition, over time the number of individual belonging to low-income class has increased, from 0.21 to 0.289. This implies that in UK, the income inequality has been increasing trough the period.

What is it about growing up in poverty that reduces the probability of economic success later in life? On average, children whose families live in poverty have lower levels of cognitive skills, noncognitive skills (e.g. behavior including perseverance and adaptability) and health, all of which contribute to earnings in adulthood. In this article, I examine the role children's health plays in intergenerational transmission of economic status from an economic perspective and in the context of a developed, highincome country (the United States) Evidence suggests that the mechanisms by which parents income affects children's health include, but are not limited to, reduced access to health insurance and medical care, greater exposure to environmental toxins, inadequate nutrition, and greater family violence and stress. I conclude with evidence suggesting that public investments in children's health can reduce the intergenerational transmission of economic status and the inequality of the next generation in the United States, as well as in other less developed nations.",
    "421": "The declining prevalence of two-parent families helped increase income inequality over recent decades. Does family structure also condition how economic (dis)advantages pass from parents to children? If so, shifts in the organization of family life may contribute to enduring inequality between groups defined by childhood family structure. Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, I combine parametric and nonparametric methods to reveal how family structure moderates intergenerational income mobility in the United States. I find that individuals raised outside stable two-parent homes are much more mobile than individuals from stable two-parent families. Mobility increases with the number of family transitions but does not vary with childrens time spent coresiding with both parents or stepparents conditional on a transition. However, this mobility indicates insecurity, not opportunity. Difficulties maintaining middle-class incomes create downward mobility among people raised outside stable two-parent homes. Regardless of parental income, these people are relatively likely to become low-income adults, reflecting a new form of perverse equality. People raised outside stable two-parent families are also less likely to become high-income adults than people from stable two-parent homes. Mobility differences account for about one-quarter of family-structure inequalities in income at the bottom of the income distribution and more than one-third of these inequalities at the top.",
    "422": "Why do some American cities appear to be havens of opportunity while others remain stratified? Recent studies illustrate large differences in intergenerational income mobility between American cities, especially for low-income individuals. These differences are difficult to explain through economic productivity alone for example, some booming cities, like Atlanta, GA and Columbus, OH, exhibit low levels of income mobility. I argue that differences in city policy are at the root of disparities in income mobility. In particular, I examine the effect of accessible public transportation on income mobility. Drawing upon sociologist William Julius Wilsons spatial mismatch hypothesis, I make a case that physical separation from jobs perpetuates intergenerational poverty, and that effective public transportation alleviates this separation. New data allows me to test this nationally. I conduct my analysis in two parts: First, a national statistical study of urban intergenerational income mobility from 1980 to 1996, using public transit accessibility as an explanatory variable. Second, a case study of the politics of public transportation in Columbus, OH, using elite interviews and historical sources. Synthesizing these two parts, I argue that public transit's social efficacy depends on the structure of local institutions: In cities with fewer veto points for regional planning and greater municipal fiscal autonomy, local governments are more likely to prioritize democratic goals in transit planning over technocratic ones. At the same time, citizen support is essential: City governments are more responsive to demands for public transit when there is a confluence of interests between social classes in its favor.",
    "423": "How does the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage come about? This study aims to broaden our understanding by examining the extent to which income trajectories in later stages of young adulthood are influenced by the work- and family-related pathways young people take into adulthood. The transition to adulthood is a demographically dense period, in which individuals make important decisions regarding their future career and family life, which in turn are likely to have a large impact on their future earnings. This study assesses to what extent the influence of family background, in terms of parental income, education, family structure and race, is mediated by the career and demographic pathways that youths choose during the transition to adulthood. It is examined to what extent incomes diverge between those opting for different pathways to adulthood and whether within groups choosing for the same pathway to adulthood, family background remains to have an influence on these income trajectories. This study uses panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths of 1997 (N=4966) Sequence analysis is used to define different career (based on education and employment) and demographic pathways (based on household, relationship and parenthood status) between age 17 and 25, separately for men and women. The family background variables and the different clusters are included as categorical variables in a growth curve model, with annual income between age 25 and 32 as the dependent variable. Results indicate that the effects of family background variables mostly disappear once the career and demographic clusters are included. Career pathways appear to be more important in explaining differences in income trajectories in early adulthood than demographic pathways. Incomes diverge for individuals who are in career clusters with longer college enrollment compared to those who are in clusters that have little college education.",
    "424": "Income inequality and income intergenerational immobility are positively associated across countries. Here we provide an explanation for this association and show it is mechanically driven by the definition of the intergenerational earnings elasticity. This may hint that higher intergenerational mobility will lead to lower income inequality and vice versa. However, it questions the underlying economic significance of the empirical findings depicted in the so-called \"Great Gatsby curve,\" as it presents the relationship between two measures of the same underlying mathematical property. We also find a similar relationship between the intergenerational earnings elasticity and the rank-rank slope. We conclude that measuring inequality using the Gini coefficient and intergenerational mobility using intergenerational earnings elasticity or rank-rank slope is fundamentally equivalent under general assumptions.",

Thus, the ultimate goal of this study is to examine the relationship between intergenerational income mobility and higher education for three major groups, including urban residents, rural residents, and rural-urban migrants from a political economic perspective. Theoretically speaking, interactive autonomy-based Political Economic Theory has been utilized to elaborate the rationales of social and education stratification and solidification that implicitly impact the intergenerational income mobility for rural, urban and migrants families in contemporary China. Moreover, the findings from this study suggested that urban higher income group and rural higher income groups are significantly influenced by childrens length of education. In addition, fathers income has significantly impact on childrens income for urban higher income group, urban low-income group, rural high-income group, and rural low-income group. Moreover, fathers length of education has directly impact on childrens length of education for most of groups. Furthermore, fathers length of education has significant impact on fathers income for all groups. Additionally, based on the results from this study, relevant policy recommendations and suggestions have been provided to eliminate the gaps between intergenerational mobility and inequality of education access.",
    "426": "Author(s): Kulkarni, Nirupama | Advisor(s): Wallace, Nancy; Malmendier, Ulrike | : This dissertation consists of two chapters on mortgage finance and homeownership. Federal policy often institutes uniform pricing across regions in the name of fairness. I study the unintended consequences of such uniform pricing in the context of the residential mortgage market, which is heavily influenced by the securitization policies of the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) I show that the regional uniformity of GSE-conforming mortgage rates leads to credit rationing. I develop three results by exploiting differences in the strength of lender rights --- state laws that limit a lender's recourse and ability to foreclose on property --- as a source of regional variation. First, controlling for borrower characteristics, I find that GSE-securitized mortgage rates do not vary across lender rights whereas those of privately securitized mortgages do vary. Second, the lack of regional variation in mortgage rates leads to the credit rationing of marginal borrowers in regions with borrower-friendly laws, whereas, regression discontinuity and bunching estimates show that the GSEs cherry-pick the better risks leading to greater credit access in lender-friendly areas. Finally, I find that the GSEs' cost of funds advantage distorts the pool of borrowers available to the private market and that only some of the GSE-rationed borrowers can access privately securitized mortgages. Overall, the results demonstrate how uniform regional pricing and cost of funds advantages of the GSEs distorts the competitive landscape of the US mortgage market.The second chapter studies the impact of homeownership on intergenerational mobility. The benefits of homeownership feature prominently in the academic and policy discussions alike. Increasing homeownership has been a major policy goal for decades, especially in low-income areas. We show that the positive relationship between homeownership and intergenerational mobility is highly place-dependent. First, we link commuting zone-level homeownership rates to intergenerational mobility, and find a strong positive relationship. The relationship persists after instrumenting for ownership using housing supply and price shocks. Second, we show that the positive relation between of homeownership and upward mobility is significantly diminished or disappears in areas with high sprawl or segregation, whether we use income segregation, racial segregation, or a new measure of homeowner segregation. These results, as well as additional findings on the formation of social capital and on school quality, suggest that homeownership may not benefit, or may even disadvantage children in segregated, poor areas, possibly through reduced residential mobility.",

She argues that there is good evidence that relative intergenerational income mobility declined over time in the UK and that governments can indeed affect the mechanisms which can promote social mobility. To do so they must take a close look at the overall shape of society.",

We explore intergenerational income mobility during the last two decades in India using nationally representative survey data. Mobility has been generally low and though stickiness over generations is declining, most of this is caused by more downward movement than up. Improvement has not occurred for the tribals who are spatially isolated and hence outside the orbit of mainstream economic dynamics calling for more inclusive policies.",

As of 2013, income inequality and the foreign-born share of the American population are at levels not seen since the end of the Age of Mass Migration (1850-1914) and intergenerational mobility is at a historical low. These changes have provoked calls for restrictive and selective immigration policies, which are better designed to attract immigrants equipped to make it in America. Underlying these calls, however, is an assumption that the outcomes of immigration depend on who migrates rather than what opportunities people encounter or create for themselves after arrival.This dissertation focuses on the difference that place and context make to the lives of people. Broadly, it asks: are intergenerational inequalities in income, education and location mainly driven by individual and family characteristics, or are they driven by peoples access to opportunity and their interaction with places? This dissertation uses cutting-edge techniques and newly available data sources from the Age of Mass Migration to tackle these questions. These data shed light on the problem of people and place by helping to address three crucial questions. First, how do places affect decisions to migrate? Second, is immigrant social mobility mainly driven by family characteristics or opportunities at settlement locations? Third, how do differences in the opportunity structures of places emerge? The following five chapters address these three questions. Chapter 1 provides the conceptual apparatus for understanding how the characteristics of place and people shape inequality in life chances. Chapters 2 and 3 examine these questions using newly assembled data on three generations of Irish American families from 1901 to 1940. Chapter 4 exploits records from the Industrial Removal Office, an organization which helped 40,000 struggling Jewish households leave New York in the early twentieth century, as a natural experiment to study the effect of place on immigrant assimilation. Finally, Chapter 5 studies how long-run development processes have shaped intergenerational mobility outcomes from the Age of Mass Migration to today.",

In new research which uses census data on names and occupational income to examine social mobility between 1850 and 1940, Claudia Olivetti and Daniele Paserman find that intergenerational mobility was high in the 19th Century, then fell sharply between 1900 and 1920, and began to improve somewhat after that. They argue that these changes in economic mobility were influenced by regional differences in economic development and fluctuations in income and wealth inequality",

The findings indicate a significant increase in social mobility. A second objective is to compare economic and sociological approaches to intergenerational mobility, utilizing trends in income mobility and occupational status mobility for this purpose. While the former rose substantially, the latter increased much more modestly. Finally, the article analyses the relation between intergenerational mobility in education and the other two types of mobility. Breaking down income and occupational mobilities into those factors that directly link parents to children (pure inheritance) and other factors mediated by education (mediated inheritance) reveals significantly different results for income and occupation.",

Starting from the observation that the number of children in low-income households is greater on average than the number in high-income households, the paper focuses primarily on whether and how child schooling mediates the effect of the negative relation between income per child and household size on shifts in the income distribution toward greater inequality, and on lack of intergenerational mobility. The paper examines the implications of different assumptions regarding changes in the price of schooling, shifts in the returns to schooling and the role of stochastic factors in the determination of income and number of children on the level and distribution of future incomes and on intergenerational mobility.",
    "434": "Previous studies have found that intergenerational income persistence is relatively high in the United States and Britain, especially as compared to Nordic countries. We compare the association between family income and sons' earnings in the United States (National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979) Britain (British Cohort Study 1970) and Sweden (Population Register cohort) and find that both income elasticities and rank-order correlations are highest in the United States, followed by Britain, with Sweden being clearly more equal. We ask whether differences in educational inequality and in return to qualifications can explain these cross-country differences. Surprisingly, we find that this is not the case, even though returns to education are higher in the United States. Instead, the low income mobility in the United States and Britain is almost entirely due to the part of the parent-son association that is not mediated by educational attainment. In the United States and especially Britain, parental income is far more important for earnings at a given level of education than in Sweden, a result that holds also when controlling for cognitive ability. This goes against widespread ideas of the United States as a country where the role of ascription is limited and meritocratic stratification prevails.",
    "435": "Recent years have seen renewed interest in the dynamics of wealth accumulation and concentration. Questions arise as to how wealth is generated, held and perpetuated, and, following whether pre-existing wealth will grow more quickly than that generated out of the current economy. These questions have implications for the distribution of wealth (and income) and intergenerational mobility. To that end, this paper updates the analysis in of the 1996 New Zealand Rich List with analysis of the 2005 and 2015 Lists. We find that the wealth held by the richest 0.01% of the New Zealand population has risen from 6% of annual GDP in 1996 to more than 21% in 2015. There is some evidence that this wealth has persisted or will persist across multiple generations. However, there is also significant turnover in the make-up of the top 0.01% and most of the fortunes are generated in industries deemed competitive.",

    "437": "This paper estimates sibling correlations in cognitive and non-cognitive skills to evaluate the importance of family background for skill formation. Based on a large representative German dataset including IQ test scores and measures of non-cognitive skills, a restricted maximum likelihood model indicates a strong relationship between family background and skill formation. Sibling correlations in non-cognitive skills range from 0.22 to 0.46; therefore, at least one-fifth of the variance in these skills results from shared sibling-related factors. Sibling correlations in cognitive skills are higher than 0.50; therefore, more than half of the inequality in cognition can be explained by shared family background.Comparing these findings with those in the intergenerational skill transmission literature suggests that intergenerational correlations capture only part of the influence of family on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills, as confirmed by decomposition analyses and in line with previous findings on educational and income mobility.",

These associations are robust to controls for family characteristics, including parental intelligence, impulsivity, and mental health. This paper identifies developmental pathways through which intergenerational mobility of place, measured at the county level, shapes the economic prospects of children from low-income families.",

We show that Australia has greater mobility than the USA and this is not sensitive to methodological choices. We also show that spousal selection and family structure may be important determinants of income persistence across generations.",

Arguments about the culture of poverty typically emphasize psychological defects behavioral deviancy the permanency of need and the intergenerational transmission of psychological problems. None of the arguments of the proponents or opponents of the theory were based on a well-articulated theory of motivatons which linked values and motives to economic achievement and behavioral deviancy and the proponents of the underclass and welfare dependency theses did not provide strong empirical Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) an economic survey of American families conducted annually since 1968 suggest that 1/4 of the population was poor at some time from 1969-78 but the majority were only temporarily poor. About 2.2% of the entire population were poor for at least 8 of the 10 years. 1/3 of the persistent poor were elderly or lived in households headed by an elderly individual 2/3 lived in the south 1/5 lived in large urban areas and over 1/4 lived in households where the head had a substantial work history in 5 of the 10 years. Not counting welfare payments 1/2 of the persistently poor lived in the south and 1/3 in large urban areas 62% were black and 61% lived in female-headed households. An expectancy-motive framework developed to examine the links between values and economic outcomes differentiates between stable internal motives and more malleable externally-based expectancies about ones own ability to take effective actions. Little evidence was found that children raised in longterm poverty or welfare dependency will repeat their parents economic failures.",

Considering wealth mobility in the long run requires taking into account not only positional mobility (that is, how families move within a given distribution of wealth) but also structural mobility induced by changes in the distribution of wealth. Such changes are related to two structural phenomena: in the nineteenth century, the rising number of individuals leaving no estate at death and, after World War I, the decline in the number of the very rich who could live off their wealth. The paper studies the movements between these groups and estimates the IGE of wealth, taking into account the persistence at the bottom and at the top.",

For non-Western minorities, education does not have this positive effect on socio-spatial mobility. In this study we investigate potential explanations for these ethnic differences in the relationship between educational attainment and neighbourhood outcomes over time. We use longitudinal register data from the Netherlands to study a complete cohort of parental home leavers who attained a higher education by the end of the measurement period (1999 to 2012) We supplemented this data with information gathered in the WoON-survey. We examined differences in income trajectories for highly-educated native Dutch and non-Western ethnic minorities; investigated the strength of intergenerational transmission of income for both groups; and assessed individual neighbourhood experiences and contentment. We find that the highly-educated native Dutch in our subpopulation have a substantially higher average income over time, and a weaker association to the income of their parents compared to the non-Western ethnic minorities. Additionally, for ethnic minorities, our results show that the level of contentment with their neighbourhood is highest in deprived neighbourhoods compared to more affluent residential environments, and they more often reside in close proximity to their parents compared to the native Dutch, both suggesting an element of choice in neighbourhood selection.",

The study found that the IGE of income is about 0.2 and there is no clearcut trend in intergenerational income mobility. In addition, this study showed that there is no systematic relation between rising income inequality and intergenerational income mobility in contemporary Korea. Overall, the results indicate that intergenerational income mobility is irresponsive to the income inequality the respondents experienced growing up. It is assumed that education and welfare transfer programs might offset the consequences of income inequality by leading to upward mobility for children from lowincome households.",
    "444": "We explore whether differences in intergenerational income mobility between the UK and Sweden show up early in life, finding stronger associations between parental income and birthweight, height and school performance in the UK. We investigate whether these differentials can account for the country difference in income mobility. While differences in the associations in birthweight and height are too weak to matter, school performance does account for a substantial part of this difference. However, country differences in the earnings returns to these skills are at least as important as the differences in the link between parental income and skills.",
    "445": "The aim of these essays is to contribute both theoretically and empirically to a better understanding of the role of social status in intergenerational income mobility. Sociological theories have emphasized the role of social status in the generation of persistent ex-ante inequality between families, but it has received limited attention in economics. In order to advance in this direction, the first chapter proposes a theoretical model to analyze the role of reference groups and inequality in intergenerational mobility. Based on recent empirical findings, and the alternative assumptions of standard theory and prospect theory, we model the effect of reference group income on effort decisions. Findings suggest that reference group affects the inequality of economic success between identical individuals with different social origins. The size and direction of this effect depend on four key issues: (a) the composition of the reference group; (b) the functional form of relative concern; (c) ex-ante inequality and relative effort rewards; (d) expected effort beliefs and past mobility trajectories. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reference group effect leads to individuals making sub-optimal social welfare decisions. This first chapter considers only one perspective of status and focuses on the comparative role of the reference groups. However, previous literature suggests that relative concern can be addressed from different perspectives. The second chapter presents an extension of the model, which incorporates an additional perspective of social status: social rewards based on how others value the observable actions of individuals. This approach allows us to assess both the role of each status motive separately (reference group and social rewards) and their interaction. The model confirms the importance of social status to explain effort decisions and allows us to discuss under what circumstances both status motives could be an additional mechanism for the persistence of inequality between generations. We identify three different mechanisms of inequality persistence. Mobility could be low because the poor people are not sufficiently motivated to move up, due to the reference group composition. They are being discouraged by society as a whole because of low status rewards. Finally, they are discouraged by expected peer effort, because their peer group failed past attempts to move up. However, under certain circumstances, status motives could reduce economic inequalities. This is the case when reference groups of agents with a low social origin include agents from a high social origin or when the social rewards of economic success are high. The first two chapters show that the response in the effort decisions to changes in expected reference income depends on the concavity or convexity of the relative concern curve. While generally confirming the asymmetry of relative concern, previous empirical research on the levels of satisfaction considering the peers income as a reference point, is ambiguous with respect to its concavity or convexity. The third chapter contributes to the empirical economic literature with new evidence on how relative income with respect to the reference group can affect economic satisfaction, testing the assumptions of prospect theory. Furthermore, we analyze how some aspects of personality affect relative concern and economic satisfaction. Unlike previous findings, convexity is confirmed between people facing relative deprivation, which corresponds to diminishing marginal sensitivity as they move away from the reference income. Therefore, relative concern is more important among those who are close to the reference income level, and its sensitivity is greater for those in the area of relative deprivation. These results are consistent with the assumptions of prospect theory. Furthermore, we confirm that some personality characteristics affect the marginal satisfaction of income comparisons.",

I find that intergenerational persistence in education has increased substantially among blacks in recent years while remaining stable among whites and Hispanics. I observe this trend when using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics as well as the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth. I demonstrate that much of the increase in educational persistence among blacks is due to decreases in upward mobility. The increase in black educational persistence is found in both two-parent and single-parent households, and I do not find similar trends and differences when estimating intergenerational income persistence.",
    "447": "Inequality in family wealth is high, yet we know little about how much and how wealth inequality is maintained across generations. We argue that a long-term perspective reflective of wealth's cumulative nature is crucial to understand the extent and channels of wealth reproduction across generations. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that span nearly half a century, we show that a one-decile increase in parents' wealth position is associated with an increase of about four percentiles in their offspring's wealth position in adulthood. We show that grandparental wealth is a unique predictor of grandchildren's wealth, above and beyond the role of parental wealth, suggesting that a focus on only parent-child dyads understates the importance of family wealth lineages. Second, considering five channels of wealth transmissiongifts and bequests, education, marriage, homeownership, and business ownershipwe find that most of the advantages arising from family wealth begin much earlier in the life course than the common focus on bequests implies, even when we consider the wealth of grandparents. We also document the stark disadvantage of African American households in terms of not only their wealth attainment but also their intergenerational wealth mobility compared to whites.",

Since no single Korean dataset includes information on both sons and their fathers adult earnings, this study follows the two-sample approach previously applied in Korea by Ueda (J Asian Econ 122, 2013) whose estimated intergenerational earnings elasticity is 0.22, and extends the analysis by using fathers earnings from a more approximal cohort.

Our methodology encompasses doseresponse functions, counterfactual distributions, and distributional policy effects depending on the assumptions invoked by the researcher. We propose a threestep estimator that consists of (i) estimating the distribution of the outcome conditional on the treatment and other covariates using quantile regression; (ii) for each value of the treatment, averaging over a counterfactual distribution of the covariates holding the treatment fixed; (iii) converting the resulting counterfactual distribution into parameters of interest that are easy to interpret. We show that our estimators converge uniformly to Gaussian processes and that the empirical bootstrap can be used to conduct uniformly valid inference across a range of values of the treatment. We use our method to study intergenerational income mobility where we consider effects of parents income on features of their child's income distribution such as (i) the fraction of children with income below the poverty line; (ii) the variance of child's income; and (iii) the interquantile range of child's incomeall as a function of parents income.",

    "451": "In a pension system with uniform policies for contribution and accrual, each participant has the same contribution rate and accrual rate independent of the age at the time of payment. Although a common practice for public sector pension plans in many countries, this is not actuarially fair because the investment horizon of young participants is longer than the investment horizon of the elderly. We show the unintended redistributive intergenerational effects of a uniform contribution system and the consequences of switching from uniform policies to an actuarially fair system, first analytically in a stylized model with three overlapping generations. We then quantify these effects in a detailed model with multiple overlapping generations, realistic parameters and detailed information on the income distribution, calibrated on the Dutch funded pension system. The system implies a substantial transfer of income from poor to wealthy participants of about 10 billion euros. The gross aggregate transition effect of abolishing the uniform policy pension for an actuarially fair system is about 37 billion euros (5% of the Dutch GDP) For each cohort, the redistributive effects are less than 5% of their total pension.",
    "452": "Studies of intergenerational mobility have largely ignored health despite the central importance of health to welfare. We present the first estimates of intergenerational health mobility in the US by using repeated measures of self-reported health status (SRH) during adulthood from the PSID. Our main finding is that there is substantially greater health mobility than income mobility in the US. A possible explanation is that social institutions and policies are more effective at disrupting intergenerational health transmission than income transmission. We further show that health and income each capture a distinct dimension of social mobility. We also characterize heterogeneity in health mobility by child gender, parent gender, race, education, geography and health insurance coverage in childhood. We find some important differences in the patterns of health mobility compared with income mobility and also find some evidence that there has been a notable decline in health mobility for more recent cohorts. We use a rich set of background characteristics to highlight potential mechanisms leading to intergenerational health persistence.",
    "453": "This Feature contains seven new articles that exemplify several of the cutting edges in research on intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status. Section 1 of this introduction briefly summarises the articles and highlights some crosscutting themes. In Section 2, we offer a few suggestions for future research. One of the growth areas in mobility research is the study of 'multigenerational mobility,' that is, status transmission across three or more generations. The article by summarises both the theoretical and empirical literatures. One of the greatest challenges in advancing the empirical literature is simply to assemble good data that span at least three generations. The article by develops and analyses three generations of occupational data from Great Britain and the US over the 18501910 period. An example of the basis for the title's message that 'grandfathers matter(ed)' is that, when the authors apply least squares to the regression of the log of average earnings in the occupation of British sons on the same variables for both their fathers and grandfathers, the father coefficient estimate is 0.285 (with standard error 0.018) and the grandfather coefficient estimate is 0.051 (0.016) (We will say a bit more about such results in Section 2.) The article by Adermon et al. (2018) reports similar results for intergenerational wealth transmission across three generations from Malm, Sweden. Continuing on the subject of wealth inequality, the article by Boserup et al. (2018) studies wealth inequality among children in Denmark. The authors find that wealth at age 18 is a significant predictor of adult wealth. They suggest two main reasons: inter vivos transfers at young ages foreshadow additional transfers later in life, and children may inherit saving/investment propensities from their parents.",
    "454": "In sociological studies of economic stratification and intergenerational mobility, occupation has long been presumed to reflect lifetime earnings better than do short-term earnings. However, few studies have actually tested this critical assumption. In this study, we investigate the cross-sectional determinants of 20-year accumulated earnings using data that match respondents in the Survey of Income and Program Participation to their longitudinal earnings records based on administrative tax information from 1990 to 2009. Fit statistics of regression models are estimated to assess the predictive power of various proxy variables, including occupation, education, and short-term earnings, on cumulative earnings over the 20-year time period. Contrary to the popular assumption in sociology, our results find that cross-sectional earnings have greater predictive power on long-term earnings than occupation-based class classifications, including three-digit detailed occupations for both men and women. The model based on educational attainment, including field of study, has slightly better fit than models based on one-digit occupation or the Erikson, Goldthorpe, and Portocarero class scheme. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for the sociology of stratification and intergenerational mobility.",
    "455": "With inequality returning to historically high levels, intergenerational mobility has attracted growing attention from policy makers and academics. The authors use recently published county-level data to study the determinants of intergenerational mobility, measured by income levels and teen birth rates. Following Solons mobility model, the authors study the impacts of public investment in human capital, returns to human capital, and taxation. The results show that better school quality and higher returns to education increase adult incomes and reduce teen birth rates for children from low-income families. By comparing counties within or adjacent to metropolitan areas to other counties, the authors find that urban upward mobility is sensitive to parents education, while nonurban upward mobility is sensitive to migration opportunities.",
    "456": "New data reveal significant variation in economic mobility outcomes across U.S. localities. This suggests that social structures, institutions, and public policiesparticularly those that influence critical early-life environmentsplay an important role in shaping mobility processes. Using new county-level estimates of intergenerational economic mobility for children born between 1980 and 1986, we exploit the uneven expansions of Medicaid eligibility across states to isolate the causal effect of this specific policy change on mobility outcomes. Instrumental-variable regression models reveal that increasing the proportion of low-income pregnant women eligible for Medicaid improved the mobility outcomes of their children in adulthood. We find no evidence that Medicaid coverage in later childhood years influences mobility outcomes. This study has implications for the normative evaluation of this policy intervention as well as our understanding of mobility processes in an era of rising inequality.",
    "457": "This paper studies the influence of individual social capital on the persistence of socioeconomic inequality. The set of social relations constitute a form of capital that provides the individual with a wide range of resources. Social capital interacts with other forms of capital, particularly with human capital, to enhance inequality. The overlapping-generations model proposed here focuses on the long-term investment processes in human and social capital. When these effects are considered, a society may end up divided into two groups. The first comprises people stuck in a trap of low intergenerational mobility resources. The second group includes people with increasing levels of education and social capital. Within the last group, income inequalities persist due to initial differences in social capital.",
    "458": "In 2015, nearly 78 million newcomers entered the United States. While about 1 million of these individuals are legal permanent residents (LPRs) with green cards and authorization to stay indefinitely, the remainder arrive on temporary statuses with authorization to stay for a finite amount of time. This reflects one part of the complex US immigration system that includes a permanent component and a temporary component. Whether newcomers enter with permanent or temporary status has profound and long-term consequences for their integration in the US, including income and job mobility. While these different statuses may have enduring effects for immigrant adults, it is unclear what the effects are for their offspring, many of whom are born in the US or arrive at a young age. This study examines whether the entry statuses of immigrant mothers and fathers (permanent vs. temporary) affects their children's occupation type and income. This study analyzes data from the 2004 Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles. Overall, the study finds that children whose mothers arrived as LPRs are less likely to be employed in blue collar occupations. However, there is no significant effect of father's entry status on children's occupation type.",
    "459": "We build a model that, according to the empirical evidence, gives rise to oscillations in wealth within a dynasty while keeping intergenerational persistence in education attainment. We propose a mechanism based on the interaction between wealth and effort as suggested by the Carnegie conjecture, according to which wealthier individuals devote less effort in their job occupations than poorer. Oscillations in wealth arise from changes in the occupation chosen by different generations of the same dynasty as a response to both inherited wealth and college premium. Our mechanism generates a rich social stratification with several classes in the long run due to the combination of different levels of education and occupation types. Furthermore, we generate a large mobility in wealth among classes even in the long run. Our model highlights the role played by the minimum cost on education investment, the borrowing constraints, and the complementarity between education and occupational effort.",
    "460": "A recent series of studies by the Equality of Opportunity Project has documented substantial geographical differences in intergenerational income mobility. These spatial differences are important because they suggest that place matters more than previously thought in determining economic well-being. In this article, we show that family characteristics vary widely across areas and simulations indicate that differences in these family characteristics can explain a substantial share of the variation in intergenerational income mobility across places documented by the Equality of the Opportunity Project. Additionally, we show that the characteristics of families that move differ substantially from families that do not move and that family characteristics differ by the type of move made, which raise questions about the external and internal validity of causal inferences based on the Equality of Opportunity Project's analysis of movers.",
    "461": "Author(s): Poyker, Mikhail | Advisor(s): Giuliano, Paola; Wacziarg, Romain T. | : My dissertation contributes towards our understanding of effects that convict labor has on economic outcomes. It consists of three chapters. The first, ``Economic Consequences of the U.S. Convict Labor System'' studies the economic externalities of U.S. convict labor on local labor markets. Using newly collected panel data on U.S. prisons and convict-labor camps from 1886 to 1940, I show that competition from cheap prison-made goods led to higher unemployment, lower labor-force participation, and reduced wages (particularly for women) in counties that housed competing manufacturing industries. At the same time, affected industries had higher patenting rates. I find that the introduction of convict labor accounts for 16% slower growth in U.S. manufacturing wages. The introduction of convict labor also induced technical changes and innovations that account for 6% of growth in U.S. patenting in affected industries. In my second chapter, ``U.S. Convict Labor System and Racial Discrimination'' I document that after the demise of the slavery and rise of crime after the end of the Civil War, convict labor system evolved in the United States in order to finance state penitentiary institutions. It provided monetary incentives to the police to arrest more people. Black and other minorities became an easy target for a police that used a variety of minor crime laws to increase the supply of coerced labor. Using the geographical variation of convict labor camps in the United States in 1886 I show that counties exposed to a more severe exploitation of convict labor experienced higher rates of incarceration among minorities in 1920, and 1930. Moreover, after the abolishment of the old convict labor system in 1941, the racial discrimination in policing remained: the same variation of convict labor camps predicts excessive arrests of Black and Hispanic for non-violent crimes (drugs and vagrancy) To show that the results are causal I use the exogenous shock of first massive expansion of the U.S. convict labor system in 1870 that had happened when the National Prison Association was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio. I use distance to Cincinnati as an instrument for the value of goods produced by convict labor. It correlates with the likelihood of attending the Congress by the wardens of prisons, and cost of getting information about the profitability of convict labor. I perform a series of sensitivity checks and placebo tests to ensure that results are indeed causal.In the third and last chapter, using historical distribution of the prison and convict labor camps in the United States, I study the long-run effect of convict labor on equality of opportunities. Convict labor negatively affected wages of low-skilled workers and had positive effects on firms in affected industries. I document that this reallocation of welfare from wage earners to capital owners had a long-lasting effect on equality of opportunities: intergenerational mobility of the bottom income quintile got worse, while it improved for the other quintiles.",
    "462": "Intergenerational mobility is often studied using survey data. In such settings, selective unit or item non-response may bias estimates. Linking Dutch survey data to administrative income data allows us to examine whether selective responses bias the estimated relationship between parental income and children's mathematics and language test scores in grades 6 and 9. We find that the estimates of these relationships are biased downward due to parental unit non-response, while they are biased upwards due to item non-response. In the analyses of both unit and item non-response, the point estimates for language and mathematics test scores point in the same direction but only one of the two relationships is significant. These findings suggest that estimates of intergenerational mobility based on survey data need to be interpreted with caution because they may be biased by selective non-response. The direction of such bias is difficult to predict a priori. Bias due to unit and item non-response may work in opposing directions and may differ across outcomes.",
    "463": "Family income is found to be more closely related to sons' earnings for a cohort born in 1970 compared to one born in 1958. This result is in stark contrast to the finding on the basis of social class; intergenerational mobility for this outcome is found to be unchanged. Our aim here is to explore the reason for this divergence. We derive a formal framework which relates mobility in measured family income/earnings to mobility in social class. Building on this framework we then test a number of alternative hypotheses to explain the difference between the trends, finding evidence of an increase in the intergenerational persistence of the permanent component of income that is unrelated to social class. We reject the hypothesis that the observed decline in income mobility is a consequence of the poor measurement of permanent family income in the 1958 cohort.",
    "464": "Was intergenerational economic mobility high in the early twentieth century in the US? Comparisons of mobility across time are complicated by the constraints of the data available. I match fathers from the Iowa State Census of 1915 to their sons in the 1940 Federal Census, the first state and federal censuses with data on income and years of education. I can estimate intergenerational mobility between 1915 and 1940 based on earnings, education, occupation, and names. Across all these measures, I document broad consensus that rates of persistence were low in Iowa in the early twentieth century.",
    "465": "Intergenerational mobility has remained stable over recent decades in the United States but varies sharply across the country. In this article, I document that areas with more prevalent slavery by the outbreak of the Civil War exhibit substantially less upward mobility today. I find a negative link between prior slavery and contemporary mobility within states, when controlling for a wide range of historical and contemporary factors including income and inequality, focusing on the historical slave states, using a variety of mobility measures, and when exploiting geographical differences in the suitability for cultivating cotton as an instrument for the prevalence of slavery. As a first step to disentangle the underlying channels of persistence, I examine whether any of the five broad factors highlighted by Chetty et al. (2014a) as the most important correlates of upward mobilityfamily structure, income inequality, school quality, segregation, and social capitalcan account for the link between earlier slavery and current mobility. More fragile family structures in areas where slavery was more prevalent, as reflected in lower marriage rates and a larger share of children living in single-parent households, is seemingly the most relevant to understand why it still shapes the geography of opportunity in the United States.",
    "466": "We develop a model of migration in the face of geographic information asymmetries. Firms from a given city observe whether or not a local worker is a member of a disadvantaged local community, a negative indicator of productivity, but do not have this information for migrants to this city. With this knowledge, workers must decide whether to migrate and obscure information about their community of origin. Our model generates results consistent with recent trends in intergenerational mobility and internal migration as well as new predictions about the relationship between migrant outcomes and income segregation. We confirm these predictions using data from the U.S. census.",
    "467": "Existing research linking prior military employment with labor market outcomes has focused on comparing the relative income of veterans and nonveterans. However, people who join the armed forces are uniquely selected from the broader population, and the form and direction of selectivity has shifted over time, with differential enlistment rates by race, region, and socioeconomic status. Understanding changes in the demographic composition of enlistees and veterans has significant import for the study of social mobility, particularly given changes in the occupational structure since the mid-twentieth century and wage stagnation well into the new millennium. Furthermore, labor market polarization and increases in educational attainment since WWII raise additional concerns about the social origins of military personnel and their occupational trajectories after discharge. Using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys, we investigate how social background is linked to both income and occupational mobility among veterans from three cohorts of American men: World War II, Vietnam, and the All-Volunteer Force. We find few benefits for veterans, for either income or intergenerational occupational mobility, once social background is controlled, suggesting that selection into the armed forces largely governs outcomes in the civilian labor market. Our findings have significant importance for understanding civilian labor market outcomes and trajectories of social mobility during distinct phases of military staffing.",
    "468": "One element in the integration of new groups of inhabitants is location in the neighbourhood hierarchy. We define neighbourhood hierarchy in Oslo according to the median income of working age males in the neighbourhood and use a rich registerbased data set to describe neighbourhood attainment (i.e. location in the hierarchy of neighbourhoods) subsequent to completion of education. We find that descendants of parents of Asian or African background systematically occupy lower status neighbourhoods than do descendants of natives. Higher education reduces differences in neighbourhood attainment between natives and descendants of African and Asian parents, but it does not eliminate the differences. Part of the differences can be due to some kind of intergenerational inertia; we test for this in a multivariate regression frame. The interdependency between median income in the neighbourhood when aged 16 and neighbourhood attainment is stronger than between parental income at 16 and attainment. Moreover, controlling for income variables, the educational premiums for natives vanish; for descendants of Asian and Africans, they are reduced but remain significant. These results lead us to ask whether higher education for children of immigrants is a vehicle for social mobility, whereas it for children of natives is a means for maintaining privileges.",
    "469": "We provide an overview of associations between income inequality and intergenerational mobility in the United States, Canada, and eight European countries. We analyze whether this correlation is observed across and within countries over time. We investigate Great Gatsby curves and perform metaregression analyses based on several papers on this topic. Results suggest that countries with high levels of inequality tend to have lower levels of mobility. Intergenerational income elasticities have stronger associations with the Gini coefficient compared to associations with the top 1 percent income share. Once models are controlled for methodological variables, country indicators, and paper indicators, correlations of mobility with the Gini coefficient lose significance but not with the top 1 percent income share. This result is an indication that recent increases in inequality at the top of the distribution might be negatively affecting mobility on a greater magnitude compared to variations across the income distribution.",
    "470": "In recent years, the authors of several studies have established that income inequality is negatively associated with intergenerational income mobility in a phenomenon known as The Great Gatsby Curve. Yet, extant research on the effects of inequality and social mobility on peoples perceptions and social and political behavior has yielded contradicting results. In light of these inconsistencies, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between income inequality and subjective intergenerational mobility. Using data from 40 countries, the effect of income inequality on subjective mobility was examined, along with their combined effect on views regarding redistribution. The results indicated that income inequality increases mainly subjective downward mobility. The effect of subjective mobility on the attitudes toward redistribution was found to be substantial, but there were no significant results highlighting an interaction between inequality and subjective mobility. The results show how individual perceptions of opportunity inequalities are affected by the structural constraints of society. The social implications of these results are discussed herein.",
    "471": "Chinese people deeply worry about the inter-generational immobility among the social strata, and attribute it to the marketization reform subjectively. Therefore, a study on the contribution of marketization reform to the inter-generational mobility would enrich the evaluation of the extensive effect of marketization reform on Chinas economy and society, and ascertain the trend of inter-generational mobility in China. However, current literature just indirectly infers the effect of the marketization reform from the measurement of intergenerational mobility level, but does not estimate its effect directly. This paper combines the CGSS data with the market index and forms a pooled cross-sectional data, to directly estimate the effect of marketization reform on the inter-generational mobility. The empirical results demonstrate that there is significant inter-generational inheritance in Chinas families, and the inter-generational regression coefficient is 0.12. However, the marketization reform that happened in China from 2008 to 2012 has played a significantly negative adjustment role in the elder generations power on their children, which reduces by 0.8% on average. The evidence indicates that the marketization reform actually promotes the inter-generational mobility in China, and could not be owed to the immobility among Chinas social strata. After the robustness test by using MLMV estimation, and two-level nested structural equation models, the above results are also dovious. Moreover, much small regression coefficient of the market index also discloses that the adjustment effect of the marketization reform is still not strong. This discovery illustrates that China should insist on and further deepen current marketization reform, and promote the mobility of the production factors and labor force. This should also be the right development direction in the future. And the Chinese governments should promote the reform of income distribution, provide basic public services, abolish the obstacles to labor mobility, create a fair and just competition environment, and produce much more chances for up-ward mobility. The main contribution of this paper lies in that it creates a new analysis angle for the study of inter-generational mobility. The empirical results also provide much new evidence for the theory of marketization reform, social mobility, inter-generation unfairness, etc. It confirms the positive effect of Chinas marketization reform, and also helps to classify the real change trends of Chinas inter-generational mobility from a brand-new angel. The topic discussed in this paper could be carried forward at least in two ways. The first is to test much longer dynamic effect of marketization reform on the inter-generational mobility by using more periods of data. The second is to further test the effect of different sections of the market index one by one, exploring the function mechanism and its weakness of the marketization system.",
    "472": "The problems of income inequality and low fertility rate are two major challenges in China nowadays. However, there are few researches about the relationship between demographic factor and income inequality from the perspective of fertility rate and exploring the role of intergenerational income mobility in the academia. This paper theoretically and empirically explores the impact of fertility rate on income inequality. The theoretical analysis shows that an increase in fertility rate will increase the proportion of the poor, thus enlarging the income inequality in an economy under the assumption of the intergenerational income mobility. Furthermore, using a cross-country panel dataset covering 76 countries and regions between 1970 and 2011, our empirical findings show as follows: firstly, an increase in total fertility rate will lead to a rise in income inequality; specifically speaking, if each woman has one more child on average, the Gini coefficient will increase by 0.025; secondly, the results by using the birth rate as a proxy indicator for total fertility rate are identical with the basic results, which mean that different measurement indicators for fertility rate are highly correlated with each other and can be mutually substituted; thirdly, total fertility rate has a greater impact on income inequality in countries with higher level of intergenerational income mobility elasticity, lower level of income, or higher level of total fertility rate. The analysis of the mechanism and heterogeneous characteristics of the effect of fertility rate on income inequality provides international experience and enlightenment for how to deal with the serious income distribution issue under the universal two-child policy.",
    "473": "Intergenerational mobility is about the relationship between peoples outcomes and their childhood family circumstances. Researchers have sometimes defined intergenerational economic mobility as being about the extent to which an adults income and occupation are determined by their own talents and ambition, irrespective of their family background (Blanden, ) This type of intergenerational mobility differs from the structural mobility that happens when average incomes and job quality improve over time, and is sometimes also different from the intragenerational mobility that occurs when individuals change jobs or advance in their career () Because of social and political interest in equality of opportunity and economic efficiency, intergenerational economic mobility has been of increasing interest to researchers.",
    "474": "In this paper, we examine the relationship between city size and rural intergenerational mobility using prefecturelevel data in China. We find that intergenerational mobility in rural areas is positively related to urban population of the affiliated cities. This correlation is partially driven by better coverage of secondary and university education for the rural young who reside close to large cities. Moreover, our further investigation shows that the return to high school education is less dependent on parent incomes around larger cities for rural young people.",
    "475": "This article reviews the contributions of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to the study of intergenerational mobility. As the longest running longitudinal household survey in the world, the PSID is ideally suited for studying intergenerational issues. The ability to track individuals as they form new households along with the broad coverage of many dimensions of socioeconomic status over large portions of the lifecycle, make it especially ideal for studying intergenerational mobility. I highlight how the economics literature has utilized these key aspects of the data to substantially contribute to the modern view of the U.S. as among the least economically mobile countries among advanced economies. Even with the emergence of \"big data\" and administrative data sources, the PSID remains a vital source for studying intergenerational mobility because of the richness of the questions and its long panel length. I review a recent example where a highly influential study of intergenerational mobility by Chetty et al (2014) using IRS data overstates intergenerational mobility in the U.S. because of the short panel length of the tax data used in their study. The PSID has also been instrumental in contributing to our understanding of many other dimensions of intergenerational mobility including: occupation; wealth; education; consumption; health; and group differences in mobility by gender, race and region. Finally, studies using the PSID have cast light on the mechanisms behind intergenerational persistence and how persistence has changed over time.",
    "476": "Research and public conversations about income inequality and intergenerational mobility will benefit from a new approach that jointly visualizes these two measures.

    "477": "The fact that the intergenerational income elasticity (IGE)the workhorse measure of economic mobilityis defined in terms of the geometric mean of childrens income generates serious methodological problems. This has led to a call to replace it with the IGE of the expectation, which requires developing the methodological knowledge necessary to estimate the latter with short-run measures of income. This article contributes to this aim. The author advances a bracketing strategy for the set estimation of the IGE of the expectation that is equivalent to that used to set estimate (rather than point estimate) the conventional IGE with estimates obtained with the ordinary least squares and instrumental variable (IV) estimators. The proposed bracketing strategy couples estimates generated with the Poisson pseudomaximum likelihood estimator and a generalized method of moments IV estimator of the Poisson or exponential regression model. The author develops a generalized error-in-variables model for the IV estimation of the IGE of the expectation and compares it with the corresponding model underlying the IV estimation of the conventional IGE. By considering both bracketing strategies from the perspective of the partial-identification approach to inference, the author specifies how to construct confidence intervals for the IGEs, in particular when the upper bound is estimated more than once with different sets of instruments. Finally, using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the author shows that the bracketing strategies work as expected and assesses the information they generate and how this information varies across instruments and short-run measures of parental income. Three computer programs made available as companions to the article make the set estimation of IGEs, and statistical inference, very simple endeavors.",
    "478": "This study investigates the existence and extent of intergenerational mobility in Malaysia in terms of educational attainment, occupational skills level, and income level. It compares the status of working adults born between the years 1945 and 1960 and their adult children born between 1975 and 1985, using non-linear transition matrix techniques. On average, the majority of adult children have better educational attainment and occupational skills level compared with their parents. Income mobility, in absolute and relative terms, is highest among children born to parents in the lowest income quintile. The results of a logistic regression model show that education, assets ownership, gender, and location matter for upward mobility. Moving forward, there will be difficulties for the children from poor families to move up the socioeconomic ladder because of changes in policies. An inclusive development approach is vital in enhancing socioeconomic mobility to promote social cohesion, economic growth, and greater equity for the next generation.",
    "479": "Studies of intergenerational mobility have typically focused on estimating the average persistence across generations. Here, we use the relatively new unconditional quantile regression technique to consider how intergenerational persistence varies across the distribution of sons' earnings. We find a J-shaped relationship between parental income and sons' earnings, with parental income a strong predictor of labour market success for those at the bottom, and to an even greater extent, the top of the earnings distribution. We explore the role early skills, education and early labour market attachment in shaping this pattern for the first time. Worryingly, we find that the association with childhood parental income dominating that of a high level of education at the top of the distribution of earnings. In this sense, education is not as meritocratic as we might hope, as those with the same detailed educational attainment still see a strong association between their earnings and their parental income. Early labour market spells out of work have lasting effects on those at the bottom, alongside parental income.",

In both the countries the empirical results show increasing inequality of the real equivalent household income, and younger cohorts experience a higher persistence of social and economic status. In the United States income inequality is more expressed than in Germany, which is in accordance with lower intergenerational income mobility. The contribution of individual and family background characteristics and capability deprivation indicators to intergenerational income mobility is more pronounced in the United States than in Germany. The significant impact of capability deprivation in childhood on the intergenerational transmission of economic chances emphasizes the importance of economic and social policy designated to guarantee the equality of opportunity.",
    "483": "The IGE (IGE) has been assumed to refer to the expectation of childrens income when in fact it pertains to the geometric mean of childrens income. We show that mobility analyses based on the conventional IGE have been widely misinterpreted, are subject to selection bias, and cannot disentangle the different channels for transmitting economic status across generations. The solution to these problemsestimating the IGE of expected income or earningsreturns the field to what it has long meant to estimate. Under this approach, intergenerational persistence is found to be substantially higher, thus raising the possibility that the fields stock results are misleading.",

    "485": "We study the consequences of age-dependent preferences for economic growth and structural change in a two-sector model with overlapping generations and non-dimishing returns to capital. Savings and accumulation rates depend on the relative price of services consumed by old agents and on the intergenerational distribution of income. The feedback effects originating in preferences and income distribution yield three possible long-run growth outcomes: sustained endogenous growth, decumulation traps, and bounded accumulation. In the endogenous growth scenario, the transition features rising savings and accumulation rates accompanied by distributional shifts in favor of young workers, growing employment and rising prices in the service sector. Traps are triggered by initially low capital in manufacturing and low employment in services. Bounded accumulation yielding zero long-run growth in per capita incomes is induced by preferences, not by diminishing returns to capital.",
    "486": "We characterize the eects of neighborhoods on childrens earnings and other outcomes in adulthood by studying more than five million families who move across counties in the U.S. Our analysis consists of two parts. In the first part, we present quasi-experimental evidence that neighborhoods aect intergenerational mobility through childhood exposure eects. In particular, the outcomes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood as measured by the outcomes of children already living there improve linearly in proportion to the time they spend growing up in that area. We distinguish the causal eects of neighborhoods from confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place eects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles. We also document analogous childhood exposure eects for college attendance, teenage birth rates, and marriage rates. In the second part of the paper, we identify the causal eect of growing up in every county in the U.S. by estimating a fixed eects model identified from families who move across counties with children of dierent ages. We use these estimates to decompose observed intergenerational mobility into a causal and sorting component in each county. For children growing up in families at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (SD) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5% Hence, growing up in a one SD better county from birth increases a childs income by approximately 10% Low-income children are most likely to succeed in counties that have less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates. Boys outcomes vary more across areas than girls, and boys have especially poor outcomes in highly-segregated areas. In urban areas, better areas have higher house prices, but our analysis uncovers significant variation in neighborhood quality even conditional on prices.

The proportion of students who experienced upward mobility relative to their parents were estimated, using a combination of rank-rank slopes, transition matrices, and logistic regression. The results indicated that parental income and college completion are the most important of the studied factors in determining upward mobility. The majority of completers from the bottom two parental income quintiles displayed upward mobility within a few years of graduation, and among students from the bottom quintile, over half of noncompleters also had higher incomes relative to their parents. Differences in mobility rates on the basis of gender, race/ethnicity, type of major, institution type, and financial aid type were also explored.",

Although a large literature examines how personal income and inequality influence regime change and democratic attitudes, there has been little work on social mobility. We employ individual level data from the Afrobarometer and Latinobarometer, covering 33 democracies and nondemocracies, to provide the first analysis of how personal experiences of intergenerational mobility influence support for democracy. We find that mobility predicts democratic attitudes, even controlling for education and current economic situation. We also show that the effect does not run through preferences for redistribution. We instead propose two alternative mechanisms. First, individuals living in democracies credit (or blame) the regime when they experience mobility. Second, upward mobility transforms a range of values, such as personal autonomy and trust, that render individuals more supportive of democracy. Our results present a warning for democracies facing steadily declining social mobility, including the United States.",

An estimation of elasticity of income (and/or any other outcome) of individuals with respect to the income (and/or some other socioeconomic characteristics) of their previous generations is used to measure the strength of persistence of inequality over generations. A higher estimated elasticity indicates that there is more likelihood of transformation of inequalities from one generation to next generation. Such estimated elasticity is assumed to be lower in those societies which are more egalitarian and provides equal opportunities of upward socioeconomic mobility to people belonging to different social strata.

Less is known about the origin or persistence of such differences. We show that US areas populated by descendants to European immigrants have similar levels of income equality and mobility as the countries their forebears came from: highest in areas dominated by descendants to Scandinavian and German immigrants, lower in places with French or Italian heritage, and lower still in areas with British roots. Similar variation in mobility is found for the black population and when analyzing causal place effects, suggesting that mobility differences arise at the community level and extend beyond descendants of European immigrant groups. Our findings indicate that the geography of US opportunity may have deeper historical roots than previously recognized.",

I present a new decomposition of this exceptional income mobility, finding exceptional educational mobility drives many of these differences. Drawing on rich survey and test score data, I provide evidence that educational mobility partly reflects a role for culturebut also the wider context of migration. In particular, migrants facing higher first generation income penalties tend to aspire to and acquire more education, and see it as more important to success. ( JEL J62, F22, I2)",
    "493": "Studies show that the gain from China's remarkable growth of the past 35 years has not been evenly shared, especially through the intergenerational transmission of income. To address this concern, we use data from China Health and Nutrition Survey and find the intergenerational income elasticity to be 0.466 in 2011, which suggests that sons incomes are affected by their fathers economic statuses to a large extent. A cross-country comparison indicates that the degree of generational income mobility in China is lower than that in many developed nations. Meanwhile, by investigating possible transmission channels, we find that the fathers investments in the sons education and occupation play substantial roles in intergenerational transmission of income. The results not only demonstrate the trends in intergenerational income mobility in China, but also identify the most likely transmission channels, which is of great importance to improving social equality.",

To systemically examine the findings of previous studies and check the status of income mobility in Korea, this study categorizes the mobility concept using two dimensions: absolute vs. relative and within-generation vs. between-generations. The normative validity is clearer for intergenerational income mobility than in the intragenerational sense. In contrast, to determine whether intergenerational relative income mobility is deteriorating empirically requires further study using big data, while the decrease in intergenerational absolute income mobility and intragenerational income mobility is relatively clear.",

I use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data with state-level measures of income inequality and per-capita total government spending that includes federal, state and local expenditures on education, public welfare, and health care. The 4824 parents-children pairs are used for the analysis. This study provides evidence that additional government spending contributes to promoting intergenerational income mobility. Moreover, government spending moderates the effects of income inequality on intergenerational income mobility. This evidence indicates that government spending plays a role in preventing the decrease in intergenerational income mobility by offsetting the consequences of income inequality.",

We find that the IGE in total income is 0.185, and that the rank-rank slope is 0.215. These are among the lowest estimates for advanced economies. We show that there is both substantial upward mobility from the bottom of the income distribution and substantial downward mobility from the top.

We investigate, for the first time, wealth mobility in the Cape Colony. We compare a number of outcomes, and consider several mechanisms to explain our results. Our data allow us to match at much higher rates than before, and also include daughters.

    "499": "Thesis Ph. D. Michigan State University. Economics 2016%%%%The first chapter tests a recently proposed hypothesis regarding rates of social mobility. Recent work by Gregory Clark and coauthors uses a new surnames approach to examine intergenerational mobility, finding much higher persistence rates than traditionally estimated. Clark proposes a model of social mobility to explain the diverging estimates, including the crucial but untested assumption that traditional estimates of intergenerational persistence are biased downward because they use only one measure (e.g. earnings) of underlying status. I test for evidence of this using an approach from incorporating information from multiple measures into an estimate of intergenerational persistence with the least attenuation bias. Contrary to Clark's prediction, I do not find evidence of substantial bias in prior estimates.The second chapter, coauthored with Martin Nybom, further examines this hypothesis using rich administrative data for Sweden. We exploit detailed proxy measures to test the proposition regarding attenuation bias in prior estimates for Sweden, and also conduct a Sweden-U.S. comparison. We find no evidence of substantial bias in prior estimates, or that the Sweden-U.S. difference in persistence is smaller than found in previous research. We further explore the concept of family status by incorporating mothers, thereby also contributing to the literature on intergenerational transmission for women. We find that while mothers income is a poor proxy for status, incorporating information on mothers occupation improves the ability to capture transmission from mothers to both sons and daughters.The third chapter, coauthored with Cassandra Guarino and Jeffrey Wooldridge, examines the SAS EVAAS models for estimating teacher effectiveness, which are used by several states and districts in teacher evaluation programs despite little attention in the evaluation literature. The EVAAS approach involves using one of two distinct models, the Multivariate Response Model (MRM) or the Univariate Response Model (URM) The MRM jointly models scores from multiple subjects, grades, and cohorts in a 5-year period; it is generally limited to within-district purposes due to the large computational burden and is sometimes not feasible if data requirements cannot be met. Hence, the URM was developed for these situations. The URM models a single subject, and thus is less intensive computationally and more flexible with respect to data requirements. The method involves the computation of a composite score on several lagged scores in multiple subjects, and then using this composite score as the only regressor in empirical Bayes estimation of the teacher effects. In this paper, we discuss and illustrate advantages and disadvantages of the EVAAS approach relative to the other widely used and studied value-added methods. We perform simulations to evaluate their ability to uncover true teacher effects under various teacher assignment scenarios. We",

Animating the flow of individuals between the relative wealth position of parents and their adult children, we show that the disadvantage of black families is a consequence both of wealth inequality in prior generations and race differences in the transmission of wealth positions across generations: Black children both have less wealthy parents on average and are far more likely to be downwardly mobile in household wealth. By displaying intergenerational movements between parental and offspring wealth quintiles, we underline how intergenerational fluctuation coexists with the maintenance of a severely racialized wealth structure.",
    "501": "Significance Growing up in neighborhoods with concentrated violence, incarceration, and lead exposure predicts lower intergenerational income mobility and higher adult incarceration of poor black males, after accounting for commonly studied factors such as concentrated poverty and racial composition. Similar patterns emerge for the income mobility of poor white children and teenage birth among both poor black and poor white girls. In Chicago, harsh environments are also racially segregated, with little overlap in exposure rates for blacks and whites: virtually all majority black Census tracts are more exposed to hazards than any majority white tracts. This large difference in exposure rates plausibly accounts for a substantial portion of racial disparities in intergenerational inequality (2060%)",

By contrast, a study in Japan suggests that childhood socioeconomic disadvantage may be positive for adult health. In this paper, we assess the association between intergenerational income mobility and self-rated health in Japan, using detailed childhood income data for 1610 men and 1885 women aged 3049 years. We use an instrumental variable approach to identify the causal effect of upward income mobility on adult health. We find that low father's income during childhood is associated with smoking and alcohol consumption in adult life for both men and women. For men, upward income mobility was associated with worse health. Certain behavioural choices related to income mobility, such as long working hours, may have detrimental health effects.",
    "503": "Chinas complicated and diverse poverty problems gradually emerged as poverty alleviation efforts deepened and rural urbanization progressed. Among these problems, the intergenerational transmission of poverty (ITP) is the most prominent and is an entrenched issue in rural China. This study selects six typical poverty-stricken counties in the eastern, central, and western regions of China on the basis of geography and uses the transformation matrix method and a regression model to analyze the regional differentiation characteristics of ITP. We further explore its impact mechanisms based on a sustainable livelihood analysis framework with the following results: (1) ITP in rural China exhibits the phenomenon of income-stratified transmission, and the groups at both ends of the low-income spectrum are more prone to having ITP; (2) ITP and the intergenerational mobility of income for different income levels have different spatial distribution characteristics, with these intergenerational relationships exhibiting a reverse variation trend in the eastern region, while exhibiting a codirectional variation trend in the central and western regions; (3) there are differences in the subsistence livelihood capital, which affect ITP in different regions. Financial capital has a significant impact on ITP across all of China. Natural capital has a significant impact on the eastern region, and physical capital plays a significant role in the central region, while the western region is greatly affected by both human and physical capital. In view of the differences in the influence of livelihood capital on ITP in different regions, China should formulate policies to accurately address ITP in order to narrow regional differences and accelerate the comprehensive construction of a financially affluent society.",

We estimate a life cycle dynastic model and conduct counterfactual analysis to observe the effects of various tax regimes. Compared to a no tax environment, a flat tax regime reduces the correlation only by one percentage points. If the flat tax regime provides child benefits, the correlation additionally declines by four percentage points. Finally, if the taxes are progressive, the reduction, which is due to the increase in the fertility rate (quantity) and the decrease in the educational outcome of children (quality) is highly significant (seven percentage points)",
    "505": "Wealth is highly correlated between parents and their children; however, little is known about the extent to which these relationships are genetic or determined by environmental factors. We use administrative data on the net wealth of a large sample of Swedish adoptees merged with similar information for their biological and adoptive parents. Comparing the relationship between the wealth of adopted and biological parents and that of the adopted child, we find that, even prior to any inheritance, there is a substantial role for environment and a much smaller role for pre-birth factors and we find little evidence that nature/nurture interactions are important. When bequests are taken into account, the role of adoptive parental wealth becomes much stronger. Our findings suggest that wealth transmission is not primarily because children from wealthier families are inherently more talented or more able but that, even in relatively egalitarian Sweden, wealth begets wealth. We further build on the existing literature by providing a more comprehensive view of the role of nature and nurture on intergenerational mobility, looking at a wide range of different outcomes using a common sample and method. We find that environmental influences are relatively more important for wealth-related variables such as savings and investment decisions than for human capital. We conclude by studying consumption as an overall measure of welfare and find that, like wealth, it is more determined by environment than by biology.",

Like other countries in the area, also Brazil and Panama have a stagnant economy coupled with high income inequality. Our rich and detailed dataset, the IPUMS survey data bank allows us to provide the most reliable and robust estimates of intergenerational transfer, after controlling for a number of additional control variables which were unavailable in previous studies, such as family size, literacy level of fathers, and location in rural versus urban areas.We provide estimates broken down for different genders, age, location, education of fathers in each country. Our results are robust to different specifications and suggest that previous studies significantly overrated the extent of the intergenerational transfer in the countries considered. However, our figures are still compatible with an extremely low degree of social mobility.",
    "507": "Estimates of economic persistence and mobility in the United States, as measured by the IGE (IGE) cover a very wide range. Nevertheless, careful analyses of the evidence suggested until recently that as much as half, and possibly more, of economic advantages are passed on from parents to children. This 'dominant hypothesis' was seriously challenged by the first-ever study of family-income mobility based on tax data (Chetty et al. 2014) which provided estimates of family-income IGEs indicating that only one-third of economic advantages are transmitted across generations and claimed that previous highly influential IGE estimates were upward biased. Using a different tax-based data set, this article provides estimates of family-income IGEs that strongly support the dominant hypothesis. The article also carries out a one-to-one comparison between IGEs estimated with the two tax-based data sets and shows that Chetty et al.'s estimates were driven downward by a combination of attenuation, life-cycle, selection, and functional-form biases. Lastly, the article determines the exact relationship between parental income inequality, economic persistence, and inequality of opportunity for income. This leads to the conclusion that, in the United States, at least half of income inequality among parents is transformed into inequality of opportunity among their children.",
    "508": "Intergenerational mobility is higher among college graduates than among people with lower levels of education. In light of this finding, researchers have characterized a college degree as a great equalizer leveling the playing field, and proposed that expanding higher education would promote mobility. This line of reasoning rests on the implicit assumption that the relatively high mobility observed among college graduates reflects a causal effect of college completion on intergenerational mobility, an assumption that has rarely been rigorously evaluated. This article bridges this gap. Using a novel reweighting technique, I estimate the degree of intergenerational income mobility among college graduates purged of selection processes that may drive up observed mobility in this subpopulation. Analyzing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, I find that once selection processes are adjusted for, intergenerational income mobility among college graduates is very close to that among non-graduates. This finding suggests that expanding the pool of college graduates per se is unlikely to boost intergenerational income mobility in the United States. To promote mobility, public investments in higher education (e.g. federal and state student aid programs) should be targeted at low-income youth.",

The OLS estimation of father and son yields a value of 0.549. The results of quantile regressions show that in rural China, the intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) is higher at the high end but lower at the low end. The human capital investment represented by the schooling years of the children is indeed an important factor explaining the intergenerational income mobility in the rural, and its contribution rate is 26.6% much higher than the contribution of occupation. Further, the decomposition results indicate that education plays a more important role both at the low end and the high end, while occupation plays a more important role at the media quantile.

The improvement of intergenerational income mobility can improve the internal structure of income distribution and promote social stratum mobility to a certain extent. As the saying goes, knowledge changes fate, but there are also poor families can hardly give birth to noble children. Then, whether the improvement of education level can help individuals to move upwards, weaken the influence of family economic status on their income, and improve intergenerational mobility? This paper uses household income distribution survey, estimates intergenerational income elasticity with double samples, and uses Intersection item to analyze the effect of education level on intergenerational income elasticity in the model. The empirical results show that the increase of educational years can improve intergenerational income mobility, and the effect is better in rural areas. Therefore, the government should promote education fairness, protect childrens equal right to education, especially low-income families, guide them in the concept of education, continue the development of compulsory education, and improve the funding system of higher education.",

Nine complementary indicators are calculated for each Census Division using administrative data on a cohort of men and women born between 1963 and 1970. Collectively these indicators underscore the importance of simultaneously examining different dimensions of intergenerational mobility and also show that higher mobility is most strongly associated with less income inequality in the bottom half of the income distribution.",
    "512": "The current poverty cannot fully reflect the causes and consequences of its disadvantages due to the long duration of poverty, so it is necessary to examine long-term poverty and persistent poverty from the perspective of vulnerability. In this paper, it constructs a two-stage overlapping model with family and financial investment in education, using the three-stage least squares method to measure the poverty vulnerability of children and fathers from the perspective of vulnerability. At the same time, it matches the individual data from 1991 to 2015 in CHNS with the average education expenditure data of the financial expenditure on education. Through empirical evaluation of Beta regression, it evaluates the influence of the fiscal education policy on intergenerational transmission of poverty. Moreover, it discusses whether the fiscal education policy, which aims at making up for the inefficiency of investment in family education, mitigates the long-term poverty effect and the degree of alleviation. It is found that: the poverty vulnerability of the offspring and the father shows a downward trend from 1991 to 2015; there is a great correlation between the poverty vulnerability of the offspring and the father; the variables such as gender, work status, marital status and so on in the offspring will affect poverty and vulnerability; poverty vulnerability has strong urban and rural, regional heterogeneity; poverty vulnerability has the characteristics of intergenerational transmission; the increase in the fiscal expenditure on education can significantly reduce childrens vulnerability to poverty, and has a strong long-term impact on reducing the incidence of poverty in future generations, and the poverty reduction effect has a stronger impact on the lower level of education of the parents, which means that the fiscal education policy can break the intergenerational transmission of poverty; the effect of the fiscal expenditure on education in the primary school on the intergenerational transmission of poverty is more obvious when comparing with the junior high school stage; there are significant differences in the intergenerational transmission of poverty vulnerability under different levels of the fiscal expenditure, in which the intergenerational mobility is lower in areas with lower levels of the fiscal expenditure on education. It is further proved that the fiscal education policy can reduce the dependence of the offspring on the investment of education by the father and reduce the intergenerational transmission of poverty by using quantile regression and threshold regression as the robust analysis. As a result, the allocation of the fiscal education policy should be more biased towards poor areas, which should also provide more support for low-income, low-education groups. The findings of this paper are helpful to solve the target problem of anti-poverty of the fiscal policy, and provide empirical support for the discussion of alleviating long-term poverty by the fiscal policy.",
    "513": "This paper analyzes social mobility as realized by students of a high-quality public flagship university in Brazil, the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) and compares with mobility at US institutions, applying the methodology of Chetty et al. (2017) Intergenerational income mobility is analyzed using the family income of students matriculating to UFPE in 20052006 and individual earnings 1213 years later. Upward mobility is defined as the percentage of students who attain the highest quintile of individual earnings among those who matriculated from the lowest income families. We find that mobility rates are higher at UFPE than at comparator US universities as calculated by Chetty et al. (2017) While these are non-causal estimates, they nonetheless suggest that public universities can play a key role in facilitating upward social mobility in Brazil. Disaggregating by gender, we find higher mobility rates for men than for women in both UFPE and US comparator institutions. Using UFPE admissions data, we are able to explore the role of both ability and major choice on mobility gaps by gender and race. For both women and Afro-Brazilians, the proxy for ability (college entry exam) does not explain the gap in reaching the top earnings quintile compared to white males. However, the choice of major is found to be an important factor in limiting mobility for these demographic groups.",

The question of how Americans think about socioeconomic mobility prospects is drawing growing attention from scholars and policy makers. Our study proposes a survey instrument that connects the empirical literature on patterns of mobility with the literature on the public perceptions of mobility. With large-scale, population-representative data, we show that Americans overestimate the intergenerational persistence in income ranks. That is, they tend to see greater inequality of economic prospects between children from rich and poor families. These results highlight the need for policy and political solutions that seriously engage with Americans concerns about the equality of opportunity in the society.",

Based on unique data from Norwegian tax registers, we address questions about the association between class origin, wealth transfers, and wealth accumulation among young adults. We show that is more common to receive transfers in the higher than in the lower social classes, and that those originating in the economic upper class, i.e. large proprietors, owners, of single enterprises as well as investors with diversified portfolios, and top managers and directors, are especially likely to receive transfers, as well as especially large inter vivos gifts. As young adults, those with upper-class origins, and especially origins in the economic upper class, accumulate more wealth than those with origins in classes lower in the social hierarchy. In all social classes, those who have received wealth transfers accumulate most wealth. We argue that transferring wealth indeed appears as robust and efficient mobility or reproduction strategy.",

Our treatment effect parameter estimates suggest that once we account for the differential return to college majors, the urban wage premium, and the proportionality/dependence of the labor market return of Black student college attendees on the share of a college/universitys student population that is Black, there is a long-run earnings premium associated with HBCU attendance. In addition, for HBCUs in general, we find that there is a population of students who would realize a positive labor market premiumas high as approximately 42%and earn more than a high school graduate if they were to attend an HBCU. With respect to intergenerational income mobility, we find that HBCU attendance enables their actual and potential attendees to move to a higher quantile of income relative to their households in the long run.",

We estimate sibling similarity in income taking a life course perspective. We employ high-quality Swedish register data that allow us not only to look at the variation in sibling similarity over the life course but also to estimate sibling resemblance in income accumulated over the whole life course. Our findings show that sibling similarity in accumulated income is higher than sibling similarity in income at any specific age. Sibling similarity in accumulated income is largely stable over the life course. It is lower for sisters than for brothers, but differences diminish across cohorts. We also find largely the same amount of sibling similarity in accumulated income in socioeconomically advantaged and in socioeconomically disadvantaged families. We conclude that previous research underestimated the intergenerational persistence of income by focusing on non-accumulated measures. Our study shows that intergenerational income mobility is lower than previously assumed, even in a society with universal, free education and low income inequality.",

The baseline IGE estimates show that Vietnam occupies the intermediate degrees of intergenerational mobility of earnings and income for both sons and daughters. In particular, a rise of 10 per cent in fathers earnings is on average associated with an increase of 3.61 per cent and 3.94 per cent for sons earnings and income, respectively. The corresponding figures for daughters earnings and income are 2.84 per cent and 3.33 per cent, respectively.",

Our SWB measures encapsulate both life satisfaction and mental health, and we consider both relative and absolute movements in income. We find that relative income mobility is a significant predictor of life satisfaction and mental health, whether people move upward or downward. For absolute income, mobility is only a consistent predictor of SWB and mental health outcomes if the person moves downwards, and in this case the impact is far larger than relative mobility. For both relative and income mobility, downward movements impact SWB to a greater extent than upward movements, consistent with exhibiting loss aversion. Notably, we find that social class mobility does not affect SWB. We present evidence that the significant relative and absolute mobility effects we find operate partially through financial perceptions and consumption changes which can occur because of income mobility.",
    "520": "Incorporating population growth into a simplified version of this article analyzes the effect on the relationship between intergenerational mobility and economic development. If the fertility is the same across income groups, population growth does not influence the basic dynamics of the economy. With, however, the fertility difference, population growth plays a crucial role in characterizing the intergenerational mobility. Suppose, in particular, that the fertility of the educated is higher than that of the uneducated. Then the share of the educated increases sharply due to the fertility difference. This sharp increase largely raises the average wage in the economy, which in turn boosts the education cost. The large increase in the education cost facilitates downwards mobility, and hence decreases the population share of the educated. Thus, if the fertility difference is large enough, the mobility exhibits cyclical behaviour. In contrast, if the fertility of the uneducated is higher than or equal to that of the educated, the same dynamics as in appears.",
    "521": "The intergenerational income elasticity (IIE) is a crucial measure of income mobility. In this article, we develop a structural model to examine the channels through which this elasticity operates. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we separately identify the human capital and the financial components. The human capital component examines the transmission of human capital, independent of financial investments, whereas the financial component examines the impact of income that is uncorrelated with human capital, that is, exogenous income. Using a twostage framework, we show that the IIE operates through both channels. Moreover, our estimates show that the financial component may have a larger effect than previously estimated, plausibly attributing to 36% of intergenerational income transmission. Indeed, this result holds even when the financial component is defined in an incredibly narrow manner. This suggests that cash payments could promote intergenerational mobility.",

The occupational income score (OCCSCORE) is often used as an alternative measure of labor market outcomes. Using modern Census data, we find that the use of OCCSCORE biases results towards zero and can frequently result in statistically significant coefficients of the wrong sign. We use a machine learning approach to construct a new adjusted score based on industry, occupation, and individual demographics. Our alternative score substantially outperforms OCCSCORE in both modern and historical contexts. We illustrate our approach by estimating racial and gender earnings gaps in the 1915 Iowa State Census and intergenerational mobility elasticities using linked data from the 1850-1910 Censuses.",

Education plays an important role in increasing intra-generational as well as intergenerational mobility. The earning IGE for children with less than primary education is rather high, at 0.51, while this IGE for those with a college or university degree is much lower at 0.17.",
    "525": "With the rise in economic inequality in the United States in recent decades, there has been growing concern about whether there is a sufficient degree of equality of opportunity in our society.Policymakers and researchers alike often focus on studies of intergenerational mobility as a way of assessing opportunity.These studies typically analyze distinct aspects of socioeconomic status, such as income, education, occupational status, and health, and measure the association in these outcomes between parents and their adult children. 1 If the association (level of similarity) is very high, then this may indicate that there is low mobility and relatively little opportunity for poor children to overcome their initial economic disadvantage.However, one important dimension of economic status that has largely been overlooked in these studies is financial health.In particular, the ability to access credit is one critical way in which individuals and families can improve their living standards-for example, by investing in education, housing, or starting a business.Access to credit is also important to help families cushion against financial shocks, such as a job layoff or medical emergency.In this Chicago Fed Letter, we focus on several measures of intergenerational mobility that utilize credit scores.",

While there is a large literature on the intergenerational transmission of education, occupation and social status, the focus here is on disadvantage as seen through the lens of income (earnings) and welfare receipt. The paper places Australian evidence in the international context and shows that, on balance, the Australian evidence is consistent with the international literature. In particular, the evidence suggests that Australian parents pass some part of their social and economic position on to their children. Going forward, it will be important to move beyond international benchmarking exercises to develop a better understanding of the process underlying Australian social mobility.",
    "527": "The conventional justification for moving from income distribution to intergenerational mobility analysis is that the movie encompasses the snapshot and is normatively superior as the basis for assessing policy. Such a perspective underpins many an argument for shifting the focus from income redistribution, which is said to equalize outcomes, to equalizing opportunity by increasing mobility through such policies as equal provision of public education. This paper argues that this perspective can be misleading. It shows that normative evaluation of mobility in any event often falls back on a snapshot perspective. Further, the snapshot itself often contains the seeds of the movie, as posited in the Great Gatsby Curve. Income redistribution can itself improve mobility even if that is the only objective. The paper thus speaks in praise of snapshots.",
    "528": "This dissertation studies the first Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to Urban areas in the northern United States. While most existing research has focused on the experiences of the migrants themselves, I am focused on how this influx of rural black migrants impacted outcomes for African Americans who were already living in the north and had already attained a modicum of economic success. Common themes throughout this dissertation involve the use of the complete-count U.S. population census to link records across years. In the first chapter, I linked northern-born blacks from 1910 to 1930 to study how the arrival of new black residents affected the employment outcomes of existing northern-born black residents. I find that southern black migrants served as both competitors and consumers to northern-born blacks in the labor market. In the second chapter, my co-authors and I study the role of segregated housing markets in eroding black wealth during the Great Migration. Building a new sample of matched census addresses from 1930 to 1940, we find that racial transition on a block was associated with both soaring rental prices and declines in the sales value of homes. In other words, black families paid more to rent housing and faced falling values of homes they were able to purchase. Finally, the third chapter compares the rates of intergenerational occupational mobility by both race and region. I find that racial mobility difference in the North was more substantial than it was in the South. However, regional mobility difference for blacks is greater than any gap in intergenerational mobility by race in prewar American. Therefore, the first Great Migration helped blacks successfully translate their geographic mobility into economic mobility.",
    "529": "Most intergenerational mobility studies rely on either snapshot or time-averaged measures of earnings, but have yet to examine resemblance of earnings trajectories over the life course of successive generations. We propose a linked trajectory mobility approach that decomposes the progression of economic status over two generations into associations in four life-cycle dimensions: initial position, growth rate, growth deceleration, and volatility. Using father-son dyad data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we show that men resemble their fathers not only in the overall level of earnings but also in the pattern by which their earnings develop over time. The intergenerational persistence of earnings varies substantially across life stages of both generations; it is strongest for fathers early-career and sons mid-career, with an IGE (IGE) as high as .6. This result can be explained by the concurrence of the parents early career and the offsprings early childhood. Our findings suggest the intergenerational economic association between parents and offspring is not age-constant but is contingent on the respective life stages of both generations and, most importantly, the period during which they overlap.",

    "531": "We study the relationship between inter-class inequality and intergenerational class mobility across 39 countries. Previous research on the relationship between economic inequality and class mobility remains inconclusive, as studies have confounded intra- with between-class economic inequalities. We propose that between-class inequality across multiple dimensions accounts for the inverse relationship between inequality and mobility: the larger the resource distance between classes, the less likely it is that mobility from one to the other will occur. We consider inequality in terms of between-class differences in three areaseducation, wages, and incomeand in a composite measure. Building on sociological mobility theory, we argue that cross-country variation in mobility results, in part, from families adapting to different levels of between-class inequality. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find a negative correlation between inter-class inequality and social fluidity, with between-class inequality being a better predictor of mobility chances than conventional distributional measures. We also find that the resource distance between classes is negatively related to the strength of their intergenerational association for some off-diagonal origin and destination (OD) class combinations.",
    "532": "We study a model in which parents care about the economic and social status of their offspring. The chances of an individual achieving social status depends on innate traits, that is, IQ, ability, social and cultural environment, and other price-insensitive endowments, passed on by their parents, on human capital investments and on chance events. Parents can, through human capital investments, increase the offsprings probability of climbing the social ladder, although they cannot borrow against the childrens perspective earning. Consequently, income and trait heterogeneity are the determinants of unequal opportunities and of intergenerational mobility.",
    "533": "This report reviews evidence on intergenerational mobility, which measures the extent to which children's labour market outcomes are independent of the outcomes of their parents. The report first reviews evidence on descriptive questions, documenting that mobility levels vary considerably across countries, and even across areas within countries. Mobility appears to be substantially lower in low-income than in high-income countries, but even among countries of similar income levels large differences can be seen. Moreover, in countries or areas with larger income disparities, children's outcomes tend to depend more strongly on parental outcomes. A key focus is on the underlying drivers of intergenerational mobility: what factors and policies contribute to higher mobility?",
    "534": "We analyze inequality and mobility across generations in a dynastic economy. Nurture, in terms of bequests and the schooling investment into the next generation, is observable but the draw of nature in terms of ability is hidden, stochastic and persistent across generations. We calibrate the model to U.S. data to illustrate mechanisms through which nurture and nature affect mobility and the transmission of income inequality across generations, thus complementing the vast empirical literature. To provide a benchmark for the observed status quo, we solve for the social optimum in which the planner weighs dynasties equally and chooses optimal tax schedules subject to incentive compatibility. Analyzing the transition from the calibrated steady state to this social optimum, we find that insurance against intergenerational ability risk increases on the transition path by making welfare of family dynasties more dependent on nurture relative to nature. The insurance comes at the cost of less social mobility. We compare welfare in the social optimum and economies with a simple history-independent tax and subsidy system.",
    "535": "Previous research has shown that the intergenerational transmission of advantage disappears once individuals obtain a bachelor's degree. This is known as the equalization thesis: the 'meritocratic power' of a college degree. This paper revisits the question of origin-destination association among college graduates. We improve on earlier studies by using three large sample (40,000+) of the National Survey of College Graduates, consisting of birth cohorts between 1938 and 1985. Contrary to the equalization thesis, we find that parental education and parental income are associated with substantially higher post-college incomes. An individual's own attainment only partially mediates the association through the type of college attended, but not through attaining an advanced degree. The consistency of the origin-destination estimates across three decades supports a reproduction thesis of mobility.",
    "536": "Objectives This study focuses on the impact of race and ethnicity on intergenerational mobility between mothers and children. Background Most studies have examined intergenerational mobility between fathers and their children. Racial and ethnic disparities might explain the high rates of intergenerational inequality in mobility. Methods The current study used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 for Children and Young Adults. The two data sets were merged based on mother and child's identification number. The final sample consisted of 1,245 nonBlack/nonHispanic, 740 Black, and 538 Hispanic dyads. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results There are ethnic and racial disparities in net worth and poverty among mothers. Black and Hispanic mothers were less likely to accumulate net worth compared with nonBlack/nonHispanic mothers, and they were also at greater risk of being in poverty compared with nonBlack/nonHispanic mothers. For intergenerational economic mobility, net worth and not living in poverty across mothers were associated with higher income among young adult children. Black race moderated the relationship between maternal net worth and young adult children's income. Conclusion A new perspective is necessary to explore intergenerational economic mobility, considering relations between mothers and children rather than fathers and children. Implications Eliminating discrimination in the labor market is critical to addressing racial and ethnic disparities in economic resources. Service programs to help Black women with children to save money or increase their job opportunities should be in place to improve their potential for upward economic mobility across generations.",
    "537": "We construct publicly available statistics on parents incomes and students earnings outcomes for each college in the United States using deidentified data from tax records. These statistics reveal that the degree of parental income segregation across colleges is very high, similar to that across neighborhoods. Differences in postcollege earnings between children from low- and high-income families are much smaller among students who attend the same college than across colleges. Colleges with the best earnings outcomes predominantly enroll students from high-income families, although a few mid-tier public colleges have both low parent income levels and high student earnings. Linking these income data to SAT and ACT scores, we simulate how changes in the allocation of students to colleges affect segregation and intergenerational mobility. Equalizing application, admission, and matriculation rates across parental income groups conditional on test scores would reduce segregation substantially, primarily by increasing the representation of middle-class students at more selective colleges. However, it would have little effect on the fraction of low-income students at elite private colleges because there are relatively few students from low-income families with sufficiently high SAT/ACT scores. Differences in parental income distributions across colleges could be eliminated by giving low- and middle-income students a sliding-scale preference in the application and admissions process similar to that implicitly given to legacy students at elite private colleges. Assuming that 80% of observational differences in students earnings conditional on test scores, race, and parental income are due to colleges causal effectsa strong assumption, but one consistent with prior worksuch changes could reduce intergenerational income persistence among college students by about 25% We conclude that changing how students are allocated to colleges could substantially reduce segregation and increase intergenerational mobility, even without changing colleges educational programs.",

    "539": "In this dissertation, I study different dimensions of socioeconomic inequality. My objective is to produce empirical evidence to help governments design better policies in the fields of education and the labor market. The two first chapters are focused on educational inequality and the effect of policies that aim to tackle this issue, while the third chapter aims to present useful solutions to an important conceptual issue for measuring intergenerational mobility. In the first chapter, Affirmative Action, Centralized Admissions and Inequality in Access to Higher Education: Evidence from Brazil, I analyze how two major reforms, introduced to democratize access to public higher education in Brazil, impacted enrollments of students from a low-socioeconomic status. The first policy centralized applications in a nationwide platform and the second expanded affirmative action quotas to a uniform share of fifty percent of all vacancies offered by each major and institution. Their progressive adoption generates cross-sectional and time variation, allowing the separate identification of their causal effects. Results show that the affirmative action reform increases enrollments of public school, black and low-income students, while the centralized admission system acts in the opposite direction, decreasing their participation. Moreover, the interaction between both policies has a positive and significant effect on enrollments of the vulnerable groups. I then shed light on some mechanisms behind these results. I find that centralization disproportionately increases enrollments of high-SES out-of-state students in the least prestigious degrees, crowding-out low-SES students with mobility constraints. On the other hand, the expansion of affirmative action does not only mechanically improve equity, but also changes application behavior. In the second chapter, Does Affirmative Action in Undergraduate Education Impact High Schools? I delve into the analysis of unintended consequences of affirmative action initiatives in higher education, which have been implemented in different countries to improve access of vulnerable groups and to reduce inequality in educational attainment. A growing empirical literature has investigated how such policies impact college students' outcomes and pre-college human capital accumulation. Yet, little is known about how they affect students' choice of high school and, consequently, school quality and peer interaction. I study this question in the context of Brazil, one of the most unequal countries in the world, and where the government approved, in 2012, the Quota Law (QL)'' It established that fifty percent of all vacancies in each major and federal higher education institution, including some of the best universities in the country, has to be reserved to students that attended secondary education integrally in a public school. I show that the adoption of QL increases strategic mobility from private to public schools by 29 percent and that the movers come disproportionately from low-SES and low-quality private schools. Nevertheless, this exogenous influx of private school students increases public school quality, while it also raises inequality within the public school system. Finally, in the third chapter, Correction Methods for Intergenerational Mobility Estimates, co-authored with Martin Nybom and Jan Stuhler, we study another dimension of socioeconomic inequality: the transmission of economic status between generations. The estimation of standard measures of intergenerational mobility ideally requires the complete income history for two generations to determine their lifetime incomes. However, empirical applications are typically based on snapshots of income over a limited number of observations in the life cycle. If those snapshots do not mimic lifetime outcomes, the estimates are subject to attenuation and lifecycle bias. The literature has followed two different strategies to address this problem. The first models the income processes itself, the second the relation between annual and lifetime incomes over the life cycle. In this paper, we use uniquely long income series from Sweden to study how well these methods approximate the IGE of income. All methods are biased to some degree, because neither accounts for three key components of the income process: (i) income growth explained by observable characteristics, (ii) transitory noise, and (iii) unexplained income growth that correlates within families. We propose a lifecycle estimator that addresses all three components, and which can improve estimates of the IGE in a wide range of settings.",

We first detail constructing the opportunity gap using race-sex specific estimates of intergenerational economic mobility outcomes for a recent cohort. We then illustrate its utility in examining spatial variation in the racial mortality gap. First we demonstrate a correlation between the racial opportunity gap and the racial mortality gap across U.S. counties; where the gap in the adult earnings of black and white children born to families at the same income level is greater so, too, is the gap in mortality. Second, we show in a multivariable framework that the racial opportunity gap is associated with the racial mortality gap net of differences in the socioeconomic composition of the two groups. In so doing, we aim to provide population health researchers with a new empirical tool and analytic framework for examining the role of structural racism in generating racial health disparities.",
    "541": "This article examines whether meritocracy is an effective device for legitimising socioeconomic inequality. It looks at two ways in which it could be said to do thatby allocating wealth and prestige according to merit, and by creating opportunities for those born in low income familiesand concludes that the first only creates the appearance of fairness (an argument made persuasively by John Rawls) and the second is a largely unfulfilled promise. The author asks whether the low levels of social mobility in Britain and America are because they have not yet become fullyfledged meritocracies, or because they have, and considers Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murrays argument in The Bell Curve that meritocratic societies have a tendency to degenerate into geneticallybased caste systems. It examines the research by Dalton Conley, Jason Fletcher and Benjamin Domingue on this point, which shows that genetic assortative mating declined over the course of the twentieth century, and tentatively concludes that Herrnstein and Murray were wrongthat flatlining social mobility is a bug, not a feature, of meritocratic societies.",
    "542": "We document economically important correlations between children's future credit outcomes and their parents' credit risk scores, default, and the extent of credit constraints intergenerational linkages in household credit. Using observations on siblings, we find that the linkages are due to unobserved household heterogeneity rather than parental credit conditions directly affecting children's credit outcomes. In particular, in the sample of siblings, there is no correlation between parental and child credit attributes after controlling for household fixed effects. The linkages are stronger in cities with lower intergenerational income mobility, implying that common factors drive both. Finally, existing measures of state-level educational policy interventions appear to have limited effects on the strength of intergenerational linkages.",
    "543": "We analyse the impact of unequal school opportunity on intergenerational income mobility and human capital accumulation. Building upon the classical BeckerTomesSolon framework, we use a regime-switch model allowing for differences in income transmission across groups. We find that unequal school opportunity raises average human capital because of assortative matching. However, because income dispersion tends to be higher at the top, in most cases unequal school opportunity decreases intergenerational mobility. Calibrating the model to the USA, simulations suggest that school equalisation and desegregation policies have positive effects on mobility at relatively small efficiency costs.",
    "544": "The extent and causes of trends and cross-national variation in social class and occupational status mobility have been major topics of sociological research for decades. This topic has acquired renewed salience as inequality in many industrialized countries has increased and as improvements in data and estimation methods have stimulated increased scrutiny of intergenerational earnings or income mobility as well. The more recent focus on earnings or income mobility largely comes from economists, though sociologists and interdisciplinary teams have made increasingly important contributions. Compelling evidence supports the hypothesis that inequality trends are generating trends in absolute earnings mobility. Evidence about the impact of inequality on relative mobility is less clear, partly because within-country relative mobility trends are weak, partly because between-country differences in relative mobility likely have multiple causes, and partly because the rough stability in relative mobility could arise from offsetting forces. Efforts to exploit local variation in inequality and mobility have added important insights, as have studies that focus attention on mechanisms. The question of how inequality affects mobility cannot be answered definitively without a solid understanding of the multiple pathways that link a country's economic and institutional structure to its pattern of social mobility.",
    "545": "Teenage childbearing is a common incident in developed countries. However, teenage births are much more likely in the USA than in any other industrialized country. Most of these births are delivered by female teenagers from low-income families. The hypothesis put forward here is that the welfare state (a set of redistributive institutions) has a significant influence on teenage childbearing behavior. We develop an economic theory of parental investments and the risky sexual behavior of teenagers. The model is estimated to fit stylized facts about income inequality, intergenerational mobility, and the sexual behavior of teenagers in the USA. The welfare state institutions are introduced via tax and public education expenditure functions derived from US data. In a quantitative experiment, we impose Norwegian taxes and education spending in the economic environment. The Norwegian welfare state institutions go a long way in explaining the differences in teenage birth rates between the USA and Norway.",
    "546": "The relationship between the incomes of the family a child is growing up in and the education level the child obtains, has been of great interest to researchers for a number of reasons. Firstly, this gives us a measure of educational inequality in its own right, and secondly, because the relationship between family income and education is also one of the key drivers of intergenerational income mobility across time in the UK, and gradients in life chances across a range of other domains. This paper explores the evolution of the relationship between family income and education, for a group of cohorts from those born in 1958 to those born in 1991/92. The range of educational relationships we can measure depends on the age of the child. For older cohorts, whom we assume have completed their education, we can measure the full range of educational outcomes up to degree level, and their relationship with family income. For younger cohorts who are in earlier stages of education, we can measure test scores and GCSE results but not later educational outcomes.",
    "547": "Intergenerational transmission of socio-economic standing, SES is widespread. This is often measured as education, occupation, and income. We analyze how these dimensions contribute to intergenerational mobility, both independently as well as in their overlap, and add wealth as a fourth dimension. We use Swedish administrative registers, which contain unusually rich measures of these SES dimensions over individuals lives for both parents and childrens generations. We calculate sibling correlations to get the total effect of family background and then decompose by SES dimension and their overlaps. We find that: (1) the four dimensions of SES can explain up to 50 percent of the family background effect; (2) most of the SES effect for all childrens outcomes except wealth, belongs to the overlap of parents education, occupation and income; (3) over and above parents education, occupation and income, wealth adds another 5 percentage points of explanation for childrens education, occupation, and income, which is on a par with the largest of the net contributions of parents education, occupation, and income; (4) in a comparison of relative contributions, parents wealth underlies 15-20 percent of the total SES effect for childrens education, occupation and income, 35 percent for childrens income and 80 percent for childrens wealth; (5) wealth moderates intergenerational reproduction in other dimensions: The wealthiest have higher rates of reproduction in childrens occupation, income, and wealth. We conclude that wealth is an important but also a unique dimension of social stratification.",
    "548": "Adult childrens labor market status and their type of marriage are major channels through which family advantages are passed from one generation to the next. However, these two routes are seldom studied together. We develop a theoretical approach to incorporate marriage entry and marital sorting into the intergenerational transmission of family income, accounting for differences between sons and daughters and considering education as a central explanatory factor. Using a novel decomposition method applied to data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that marriage plays a major role in intergenerational transmission only among daughters and not until they reach their late-30s. This is more salient in the recent cohort in our data (people born 1963 to 1975) Marital status and marital sorting are comparably important in accounting for the role of marriage, but sorting becomes more important over cohorts. The increasing earnings returns to education over a husbands career and the weakening association between parental income and daughters own earnings explain why marital sorting, and marriage overall, have been growing more important for intergenerational transmission from parents to their daughters.",
    "549": "Public school funding depends heavily on local property tax revenue. Consequently, low-income households have limited access to quality education in neighborhoods with high house prices. In a dynamic life-cycle model with neighborhood choice and endogenous local school quality, we show that this property tax funding mechanism reduces intergenerational mobility and accounts for the spatial correlation between house prices and mobility. A housing voucher experiment improves access to schools, with benefits that can last for multiple generations. Additionally, a policy that redistributes property tax revenues equally across schools improves mobility and welfare. However, the benefits can take generations to be realized.",

Data from metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S. is used to examine how two measures of intergenerational mobility impact growth rates. More precisely, I examine how absolute income mobility and relative income mobility are related the growth rate of real gross metropolitan product (RGMP) from 2001 to 2011. I find that absolute mobility has a positive relationship with RGMP growth over the time period, and that relative mobility exhibits a negative relationship with RGMP. Results are found to be robust to two stage least squares estimation.",
    "551": "A long-standing consensus among sociologists holds that educational attainment has an equalizing effect that increases mobility by moderating other avenues of intergenerational status transmission. This study argues that the evidence supporting this consensus may be distorted by two problems: measurement error in parents socioeconomic standing and the educational systems tendency to progressively select people predisposed for mobility rather than to actually affect mobility. Analyses of family income mobility that address both of these problems in three longitudinal surveys converge on new findings. Intergenerational mobility is significantly lower among high school dropouts than among others, but there are no significant differences in mobility across higher education levels. This is consistent with compensatory advantage processes among the least educated in which individuals from advantaged backgrounds use family-based resources to compensate for their lack of human capital.",
    "552": "Using data from the German socio-economic panel, this paper provides new evidence on intergenerational mobility in Germany by focusing on intergenerational association in ranksi.e. positions, which parents and children occupy in their respective income distributions. We find that the association of childrens ranks with ranks of their fathers is about 0.242 for individual labor earnings and it is higher for sons than for daughters. It is also higher in East Germany compared to West Germany. The results further show that rank-based measures of mobility are less sensitive than conventional measures of intergenerational income elasticity to different methodological and sample specification choices, such as the stages of the life cycle when incomes of children and parents are measured, the number of years for which incomes are considered, the treatment of zero values in income variables and the choice of annual versus hourly earnings. Moreover, they are more robust for sub-group comparisons of intergenerational mobility (e.g. across gender and region) This evidence suggests that, similarly to large administrative datasets, rank-based measures of intergenerational mobility perform better than elasticity-based measures in small samples based on survey data.",
    "553": "Inequality threatens intergenerational income mobility, but different types of inequality threaten mobility in different ways, raising distinct policy challenges. This is why empirical researchers should be agnostic in the choice of statistics they use to measure intergenerational mobility.

    "554": "Canadian children experience a high level of intergenerational income mobility compared with US children. Moreover, their physical and mental health outcomes, school readiness, and post-secondary attendance are all less tightly associated with parental outcomes than in the United States. In this article, we investigate the role played by childrens education in the intergenerational transmission of income in Canada. Existing research has produced macro-level estimates of mobility to draw comparisons over time and across places and has studied the micro-level mechanisms that underlie the relationship between parents and childrens outcomes. However, evidence on the extent to which the different factors investigated drive the broader numbers is still limited. To remedy this, we exploit the Longitudinal and International Study of Adults, a rich panel of integrated survey and administrative data covering 19822013. We estimate that the education level of children accounts for 40.550.1 percent of the correlation between their income and their parents, similar to the United States. Moreover, we discuss evidence suggesting that the greater mobility of Canadian children is linked not only to their lower returns to education but also to the weaker association between their education and their parents income. Finally, we find that almost half of the effect linked to education is associated with the skills respondents use at work, such as reading or communication.",
    "555": "This article provides a framework for estimating intergenerational mobility elasticities (IGEs) of childrens income with respect to parental income. We allow the IGEs to be heterogeneous, by leaving the relationship of parental and child incomes unspecified, while acknowledging and addressing the latent nature of both child and parental permanent incomes and the resulted life-cycle bias. Our framework enables us to test the widely imposed assumption that the intergenerational mobility function is linear. Applying our method to the Panel Studies of Income Dynamics data, we decisively reject the commonly imposed linearity assumption and find substantial heterogeneity in the IGEs across the population. We confirm an important finding that the IGEs with respect to parental income exhibit a U-shape pattern, which is occasionally highlighted in the analysis using transition matrices. Specifically, there is a considerable degree of mobility among the broadly defined middle class, but the children of both high- and low-income parents are more likely to be high- and low-income adults, respectively. This result also provides insights into the (intertemporal) Great Gatsby curve, suggesting that a higher level of inequality within one generation may lead to a higher level of social immobility in the next generation in the United States.",
    "556": "This is the first paper that studies the effects of including non-monetary income from housing (imputed rent) in the measure of income on intergenerational income mobility. Using national panel data sets for Australia, the United States and Germany, it is shown that only Australian society becomes 22% less mobile as measured by an intergenerational rank correlation. This decrease is also confirmed using the intergenerational transition matrices. As a result, cross-regional comparisons of intergenerational income mobility may be misleading, especially using tax data as imputed rent is rarely taxed.",
    "557": "In this paper, we analyse the intergenerational transmission of economic success in Austria using the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions 2011 dataset (EU-SILC 2011) Starting point of the investigation is a two-step estimation procedure, where we detect a significant positve intergenerational association between the economic situation of the parental household and educational attainments as well as gross hourly wages of their male and female descendants independently. Furthermore, we shed some light on the intergenerational social mobility black box by explaining the direct effect of the income situation of the parental generation on attainable wages of the child generation within the transmission system. It turns out that this effect is significantly underestimated when applying ordinary least squares regressions only, where the perceived socioeconomic status is taken exogenous. Finally, we apply instrumental variable quantile regressions to demonstrate that the direct intergenerational economic association between parents and their descendants is strongest for top earners. Alongside this proceeding, we introduce an alternative way to think about the impact of a bundle of additional intergenerational transmission channels like cognitive ability, noncognitive personal traits, and aspects of physical appearance on an empirical level. Overall, the findings of the paper, where special attention is paid to migrants, offer a better understanding on the intergenerational transmission of economic success mechanism and to what extent this process influences income persistence between generations.",
    "558": "Tertiary education in the U.S. requires large investments that are risky, lumpy, and well-timed. Tertiary education is also heavily subsidized. By making the risk of human capital investment more acceptable, especially to low wealth households, subsidies may increase investment in human capital, lower long-run inequality, and reduce aggregate precautionary savings. However, subsidies also encourage more poorly prepared students to attend and are usually financed via distortionary taxes. In this paper, we find that observed collegiate subsidies improve welfare substantially relative to the fully decentralized (zero subsidy) outcome. We show that subsidies help smooth consumption, lower skill premia, increase interest rates as precautionary savings fall, lower the inequality of both consumption and wealth, increase intergenerational income mobility and raise welfare, even when financed by distortionary taxes.",
    "559": "We examine how intergenerational mobility affects subjective wellbeing (SWB) using data from the British Cohort Study. Our SWB measures encapsulates both life satisfaction and mental health, and we consider both relative and absolute movements in income. We find that relative income mobility is a significant predictor of life satisfaction and mental health, whether people move upward or downward. For absolute income, mobility is only a consistent predictor of SWB and mental health outcomes if the person moves downwards, and in this case the impact is far larger than relative mobility.For both relative and income mobility downward movements affect SWB to a greater extent than upward movements, consistent with notions of loss aversion. Notably, we find that social class mobility does not affect SWB. We present evidence that the significant relative and absolute mobility effects we find operate partially through financial perceptions and consumption changes which can occur because of income mobility.",
    "560": "This study examines whether the daughters' educational attainment mediates the intergenerational transmission of economic mobility between mothers and their young adult daughters. To create motherdaughter dyads, two data sets were combined: The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 for Children and Young Adults (NLSY79 CY) A total of 2,456 dyads were included for analysis. We used a mediation model to explore the relationship between mothers' income and their young adult daughters' income. Mothers' income was associated with their young adult daughters' educational attainment and income. The mediation model indicated partial mediation of the relationship between mothers' income and their young adult daughters' income via their young adult daughters' educational attainment. Addressing issues of income inequality among mothers may serve as a buffer against the low upward mobility across generations for their young adult daughters raised by lowincome mothers. It is imperative to provide programs and financial assistance for mothers to bolster their income and thereby their daughters' educational attainment and income in young adulthood and therefore improve economic mobility from mothers to daughters.",
    "561": "This paper analyzes the roles of innate talent versus family background in shaping intergenerational mobility and social welfare under different education systems. We establish an overlapping-generations model in which the allocation of workforce between a high-paying skilled labor sector and a low-paying unskilled labor sector depends on talent, parental human capital, and educational resources, and the wage rate of skilled workers is governed by their average talent. Our model suggests that under the private education system, income inequality is inversely associated with social mobility, and the steady-state average talent of skilled workers declines as people make greater educational investments on their children. Under the public school system, the allocation of workforce depends more on talent and less on family background. Consequently, both intergenerational mobility and income inequality increase, and social welfare may improve under reasonable conditions. Moreover, if some parents are myopic, public education may yield the highest welfare.",
    "562": "Studies of economic mobility summarize the distribution of offspring incomes for each level of parent income. highlight that the conventional IGE (IGE) targets the geometric mean and propose a parametric strategy for estimating the arithmetic mean. We decompose the IGE and their proposal into two choices: (1) the summary statistic for the conditional distribution and (2) the functional form. These choices lead us to a different strategy-visualizing several quantiles of the offspring income distribution as smooth functions of parent income. Our proposal solves the problems Mitnik and Grusky highlight with geometric means, avoids the sensitivity of arithmetic means to top incomes, and provides more information than is possible with any single number. Our proposal has broader implications: the default summary (the mean) used in many regressions is sensitive to the tail of the distribution in ways that may be substantively undesirable.",
    "563": "Recent research indicates that, across three key measures, economic mobility in the United States is limited. Specifically, the Millennial generation (those born between 1982 and 2000) might not have the same opportunity as previous generations had to fare better economically than their parents. According to studies GAO reviewed, the share of people making more money than their parents at the same age (absolute mobility) has declined over the last 40 years, and the chances of moving up the income distribution (relative mobility) have been flat over time. Using a third measure of economic mobility (intergenerational income elasticity) researchers have found that income in adulthood is linked to how much a person's parents made, and that between one-third and two-thirds of economic status is passed down from parents to children. This is especially true of the lowest and highest income groups. Researchers also identified race and geography as key determinants of an individual's economic mobility.Millennials have different financial circumstances than Generation X (born 1965-1981) and Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964) and in light of flat or declining economic mobility, there is uncertainty about how they will fare financially as they age. A snapshot of data that allowed GAO to compare Millennials aged 25-34 to the previous two generations at similar ages showed that Millennial households were more likely than other generations to be college educated; however, incomes have remained flat across the three generations, implying that Millennials have not yet benefited from the potential additional lifetime income earned by college graduates. Millennial households had significantly lower median and average net worth than Generation X households at similar ages, especially among those with low net worth. Median net worth for the lowest quartile of Baby Boomers and Generation X was around zero, but it was substantially negative for Millennials, indicating that debt was greater than assets for the median low net worth Millennial household. Regarding assets, a significantly lower percentage of Millennials owned homes compared to previous generations at similar ages, but had retirement resources at rates comparable to Generation X and Baby Boomers. Finally, Millennials were more likely to have student loan debt that exceeded their annual income. It remains to be seen how these factors will affect Millennials' financial circumstances in the long run, including retirement.",
    "564": "This study finds that China's one-child policy (OCP) one of the most extreme forms of birth control in recorded history, has amplified economic inequality across generations in China since its introduction in 1979. Poor Chinese families, whose fertility choices are less constrained by the OCP than rich ones, have more children but invest less in human capital per child. Since human capital is a major determinant of earnings, the income inequality persists and enlarges across generations as a consequence. Based on nationally representative longitudinal household survey data, our estimation results show that the OCP accounts for 32.7%-47.3% of the decline in intergenerational income mobility. The OCP has significant ramifications for Chinese society, not only intragenerationally but also intergenerationally.",
    "565": "In this paper, I conduct a novel comparison of intergenerational income mobility in Denmark and the United States, based on highquality administrative data for both countries. The results confirm that the United States is substantially less mobile than Denmark, but they also show that the differences in mobility are smaller than previously reported. Mobility differences are larger for family income than individual income. When the individual incomes of children are considered, mobility differences are smaller for daughters than for sons. I also show that the estimated IGE of income for Denmark is quite robust to whether taxes or public transfers are included in the income measure.",

By making more efficient use of the available information in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we generate more reliable estimates of the recent time series variation in intergenerational mobility. Our results, which pertain to the cohorts born between 1952 and 1975, do not reveal major changes in intergenerational mobility.",
    "567": "This paper estimates the causal effect of equalizing revenues across public school districts on students' intergenerational mobility. I exploit differences in exposure to equalization across seven cohorts of students in 20 US states, generated by 13 state-level school finance reforms passed between 1980 and 2004. Since these reforms create incentives for households to sort across districts and this sorting affects property values, post-reform revenues are endogenous to an extent that varies across states. I address this issue with a simulated-instruments approach, which uses newly collected data on states' funding formulas to simulate revenues in the absence of sorting. I find that equalization has a large effect on mobility of low-income students, with no significant changes for high-income students. Reductions in the gaps in inputs (such as the number of teachers) and in college attendance between low-income and high-income districts are likely channels behind this effect.",
    "568": "This paper examines ethnic disparities in intergenerational economic mobility for the children of second-generation \"migrants.\" Using rich register data for adult children aged 20 to 30, we provide empirical evidence on the economic assimilation outcomes of the descendants of immigrants who mainly arrived in the Netherlands in the post-World War II period. Acknowledging a high degree of diversity in the starting positions of immigrants associated with their dominant migration motives, we estimate the Dutch-migrant group gap in incomes from an intergenerational mobility perspective. Our descriptive rank-rank analysis reveals significant ethnic disparities in absolute and relative intergenerational income mobility. The absolute mobility of the ethnic groups we study appears to have the following rank order: Moroccan, Turkish Surinamese, Indish, German, and Dutch. While a higher level of intergenerational transmission of parental income narrows the gap for Turkish and Surinamese children, it widens the gap for Indish and Moroccan children. Our decomposition analysis shows that the ethnic disparities found for the Moroccan, Turkish, and Surinamese third generation are entirely explained by their relatively young ages and associated unfavorable socioeconomic positions, and by their lower parental income levels.",
    "569": "In this paper, we focus on the measurement and characterization of social mobility in the Philippine labor market using standard methodologies. First, we ascertain the degree to which intergenerational wage mobility can be measured using available survey data. Second, using a simple regression based approach, we determine the extent to which wages are persistent on the part of sons and daughters relative to fathers wage outcomes. Third, we highlight the role of parental education and measure how the labor market rewards or penalizes labor market participants. Fourth, we examine the statistical importance of parental educational achievements relative to their children using the ordered probability model. The paper finds wage persistence. Transition probabilities show that persistence is observed at the lowest and highest quintiles of the wage distribution. The transition probabilities show that persistence is not uniformly observed throughout the reference distribution. Returns to education among the well-educated sons and daughters remain high, and parental education continues to determine the relative magnitudes of wage gains and penalties. Children of highly educated fathers expectedly reap wage gains while those whose fathers have finished no more than high school education suffer from wage penalties. Parental education profiles determine a childs educational achievements. Results indicate that children with college educated parents tend to graduate from college with high likelihood of success. In terms of resources, nonlabor income will only boost the probability of being a college graduate, with the rest of the education outcomes registering negative effects. Finally, consistent with the literature, children from non-poor households have higher likelihood to graduate from high school and college compared with their counterparts from poor households.

    "570": "This paper examines the factors that influence the socioeconomic development of employees particularly those having poor financial backgrounds. We investigate the relationship between intergenerational socio-economic mobility and subjective well-being moreover. We look at different measures of intergenerational mobility 1. social, 2. educational, 3. Occupational and 4. income mobility as well as 5. change in their socio-economic conditions. The mobility determinants under study included the individuals academics or level of their literacy along whit 2. their parents and family educational backgrounds, their prior economic status, and their financial status from what level of prosperity they use to belong, their siblings, children, and gender. To achieve this objective, this study adopted a questionnaire-based survey approach. A quantitative study was made by using a survey of about 370 responses. These individuals belong to different age groups, having different financial statuses, and having different social backgrounds. The data was analyzed using Structured Equation Modeling. The results suggested the number of children has a significant effect on downwards education mobility, however negatively affecting downwards income mobility and contributing to better socioeconomic conditions. However, the number of siblings positively affect upwards educational mobility but at the same time, downwards social mobility. Similarly, the level of self-education is negatively affecting education and income downwards mobility, hence contributing to the betterment of education. Fathers education level is causing an increase in social upward mobility but a decrease in occupation mobility, it is also contributing towards downwards income mobility. Mother education also seems to affect downwards social mobility as well as occupational mobility. Employees' prior economic status seems to negatively affect income downwards mobility, occupational mobility, as well as socioeconomic conditions. The key findings of this study suggest that both social backgrounds and levels of academic achievements have a significant impact on individual development in social and economic prosperity and play a significant role in the development and utilization of their skills.",
    "571": "The consequences of changing one's socio-economic status over the life coursei.e. social mobilityfor individual health are not well understood. Theories of the health implications of social mobility draw on the human perception of one's changing conditions, but empirical studies mostly examine the health implications of moving from objectively defined indicators of parental socio-economic position such as education, occupation, or income, to own socio-economic position in adult life. Little is known about the consequences of individuals' own assessment of changes in socio-economic position for health outcomes. In this study, we examine the association of social mobility and health in a unique sample of the Russian population after the transition to a market society. We take a broad perspective on social mobility, putting emphasis on subjectively perceived social mobility. Results show that individuals' objective characteristics only partially explain the variation in their subjective perceptions of intergenerational mobility. Net of social origin and destination variables, subjective social mobility is associated with individuals' health outcomes, as measured by the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Those who perceive being upwardly mobile report better health, and downward mobility is associated with poorer health. The association holds for mental and physical health, for perceived downward and upward social mobility, and for a general subjective measure of mobility and a subjective measure prompting respondents to only think of mobility in terms of occupation. These findings are robust to controlling for a rich set of socio-demographic predictors on childhood adversity, contemporaneous material wellbeing, and family-related circumstances. We conclude that a conventional focus on single socio-economic status dimensions such as occupation might be too narrow to capture the health consequences of social mobility.",
    "572": "Social scientists have long been interested in the relationship between parental factors and later child income. Finding the best characterization of this relationship for the question at hand is however fraught with choices. In this paper we use machine learning methods to assess the completeness of one popular modelling approach. Here, completeness refers to how well the model summarizes the total predictive relationship between multiple parental factors and a single child outcome. Machine learning methods enable us to depart from functional form assumptions, allowing flexible interactions between a large set of possible parental factors. Using our most flexible complete model as a benchmark, we assess the popular rank-rank model relating parent and child incomes. Applying our approach to high-quality Norwegian administrative data, we demonstrate that the rank-rank model explains 68% of the total explainable variation in child income rank, based on a broad set of potential parental factors entering a neural network. Parental wealth and parental education explain the majority of the remaining explainable variation. For an extremely tractable model, we consider this to be a relatively high level of completeness. In light of our country-wide estimates, we explore how this measure of completeness varies across regions of Norway, finding broadly similar patterns to those found at the national level. Our results imply that comparisons of regions based on rank-rank mobility measures may indeed reflect differences in broader notions of equality of opportunity.",

For the case of wealth, the estimations yield a clear regional pattern: the degree of social mobility is higher than the national average in the North and North-Central regions, similar to the national average in the Central region, and lower than average in the South region. In particular, it is estimated that the children of poor parents (i.e. parents in the 25th percentile rank in the national distribution of wealth of their generation) achieved greater than average progress if they grew up in the North region, and smaller than average progress if they grew up in the South region. The same results are found for the case of education and occupational status. However, in general, the differences between regional estimates of absolute educational mobility are not statistically significant; and the estimates of occupational mobility are not robust.",

We add to this literature by examining the impact of wealth on child income. Our two stage least squares regressions reveal that grandparental and parental wealth have an important effect on the younger generation's stock (first stage results) which in turn affects the younger generation's household income (second stage results) We further explore the relationship between income and wealth by decomposing the child's income by race. We find that the intergroup disparity in income is mainly attributable to differences in family background. These findings indicate that wealth is an important source of income inequality.",
    "575": "Using the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979, I examine the association between income inequality and intergenerational income mobility in the United States. This study finds that rising income inequality is associated with strengthening the importance of parental family income to childs income. Particularly, the evidence that greater income inequality decreases intergenerational income mobility is clearer when interstate migration problems are addressed. This evidence indicates that income inequality matters since it hinders the equal opportunity to succeed, especially for children from low-income families. If equality of opportunity is a value for policymakers, it provides justification for policy interventions and government efforts to reduce income inequality. A number of sensitivity tests confirm that the main results are robust and reliable.",

Using population census, we first estimate the intergenerational income elasticities (IGEs) across Chinese prefecturelevel cities. We then find that the prevalence of SOEs in a city is negatively associated with its IGE. The estimation using the geographic variation in SOEs created by the 156 Projects as an instrumental variable shows the suggestive evidence that the relationship between the prevalence of SOEs and intergenerational income persistence might be causal. Further analysis reveals that the prevalence of SOEs may hamper intergenerational mobility through (1) stifling competition from the private sector and (2) facilitating occupational inheritance within SOEs. Our research implies that reforming SOEs shall promote social mobility.",
    "577": "Are children better off than their parents? This highly debated question in politics and economics is investigated by analysing the trends in absolute and relative intergenerational labour income mobility for Germany and the US. High quality panel data is used for this purpose; the SOEP for Germany and the PSID for the US. In Germany, 67% of sons born between 1955 and 1975 earned a significantly higher real long-run labour income than their fathers. Those with fathers from the lowest earnings bracket were particularly mobile in absolute terms. In contrast, the fraction of US sons earning more than their fathers is 60% on average for the same cohorts. Their share decreased from 66% in the 195660 birth cohort to 48% in the 197175 birth cohort, while it changed very little in Germany. Overall, absolute as well as relative labour income mobility is larger in Germany than in the US. This indicates that economic growth has been distributed more broadly in Germany than in the US. While the majority of German males has been able to share in the countrys rising prosperity and are better off than their fathers, US males continue to lose ground. Hence, Chetty et al. (Science 356:398406, 2017) seem to be right when they say that the American Dream is slowly fading away.",
    "578": "In a pension system with uniform policies for contribution and accrual, each participant has the same contribution rate and accrual rate independent of the age at the time of payment. Although a common practice for public sector pension plans in many countries, this is not actuarially fair because the investment horizon of young participants is longer than the investment horizon of the elderly. We show the unintended redistributive intergenerational effects of a uniform contribution system and the consequences of switching from uniform policies to an actuarially fair system, first analytically in a stylized model with three overlapping generations. We then quantify these effects in a detailed model with multiple overlapping generations, realistic parameters and detailed information on the income distribution, calibrated on the Dutch funded pension system. Our base estimate shows that the transition effect of abolishing uniform policies for an actuarially fair system is about 37 billion euros (5% of the Dutch GDP) for an interest rate of 1% (the market interest rate ultimo 2017) but only 11 billion euro for an interest rate of 0% (the market interest rate as of July 2019) For each cohort, the redistributive effects are less than 5% of their total pension. We show that a system with uniform policies implies a transfer of about 10 billion euros from poor to rich.",
    "579": "A correlation curve is introduced as a tool to study the degree of intergenerational income mobility, i.e. how income status is related between parents and adult child. The method overcomes the shortcomings of the elasticity of childrens income with respect to parents income (i.e. its sensitiveness to different dispersion among the generations) and the correlation coefficient (i.e. its inability to capture nonlinearities) The method is particularly suitable for comparative studies and in this study labour earnings are compared to disposable income. The correlation between the parental income and the childs adult disposable income becomes stronger for higher percentiles in the income distribution of the parents. Above the median the correlation is found to be stronger than for labour earnings. Interestingly, the elasticity is higher for labour earnings for most part of the distribution and complementing the elasticity with correlation curves provides a much more complete picture of the intergenerational income mobility.",
    "580": "Does the way scholars measure inequality of opportunity correspond to how people perceive it? What other factors influence individual perception of this phenomenon? To answer these questions we must first clarify how scholars define and measure inequality of opportunity. We discuss the possible mechanisms linking objective measures to subjective perception of the phenomenon, then propose a measure of perceived inequality of opportunity, and finally test our hypothesis by merging data coming from two sources: the European Union Statistics on Income and Living and the International Social Survey We suggest that the prevailing perception of the degree of unequal opportunity in a large sample of respondents is only weakly correlated with its objective measure. We estimate a multilevel model considering both individual and country level controls to explain individual perception of unequal opportunity. Our estimates suggest that the two most adopted measures of inequality of opportunity have not clear role in explaining its perception. Conversely, other country level variables and personal experiences of intergenerational social mobility are important determinants of how inequality of opportunity is perceived.",
    "581": "The flight and expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe during and after World War II constitutes one of the largest forced population movements in history. We analyze the economic integration of these forced migrants and their offspring in West Germany. The empirical results suggest that even a quarter of a century after displacement, first generation migrants and native West Germans that were comparable before the war perform strikingly different. Migrants have substantially lower incomes and are less likely to own a house or to be self-employed. Displaced agricultural workers, however, have significantly higher incomes. This income gain can be explained by faster transitions out of low-paid agricultural work. Differences in the labor market performance of second generation migrants resemble those of the first generation. We also find that displacement considerably weakens the intergenerational transmission of human capital between fathers and children, especially at the lower tail of the skill distribution.",
    "582": "We extend the standard intergenerational mobility literature by modelling individual outcomes as a function of the whole history of parental income, using data from Norway. We find that, conditional on permanent income, education is maximized when income is balanced between the early childhood and middle childhood years. In addition, there is an advantage to having income occur in late adolescence rather than in early childhood. These result are consistent with a model of parental investments in children with multiple periods of childhood, income shocks, imperfect insurance, dynamic complementarity, and uncertainty about the production function and the ability of the child.",
    "583": "Relative intergenerational mobility declined for cohorts born around 1960 compared to those born around 1950. The former entered the labor market after the rise in inequality around 1980 while the latter entered the labor market earlier. We show that the rank-rank slope rose from 0.25 to 0.36 and the IGE increased from 0.28 to 0.45. These increases are more pronounced for men than for women. Increases in returns to schooling and in the gradient in the likelihood of marriage by parent income are contributors to increased intergenerational persistence.",
    "584": "For developing countries, it is difficult to find income mobility studies that rely on datasets linking parents with their children. Most of the available evidence for developing countries, instead, relies on co-resident households and two-sample instrumental variables approach, and findings in the mobility literature suggest that these approaches could introduce bias in the IGE estimates. The current study rectifies this important omission for rural India, and develops strategies that will be useful for similar research in other developing countries. Using a panel dataset spanning 19942012, I find that the intergenerational income persistence for rural India is lower than analogous evidence from other developing countries (IGE: 0.30 [se:0.03]) However, the between-groups coefficient of 0.74, which is corroborated by repeated cross-sections from the National Sample Survey, indicates that India is progressing towards cross-caste equality, but at a disappointingly slow rate.",
    "585": "We analyse intergenerational persistence in income and education in Chile and Peru for birth cohorts of the early 1950s to 1990. Both countries have seen a structural expansion of education over this period and decreasing income inequality in recent decades. We impute non-observed parental income from repeated cross-sections and estimate persistence in the range of 0.63 to 0.67 in Peru and 0.66 to 0.76 in Chile for household heads of the birth cohorts 1977-90. The analysis of educational mobility covers household heads of birth cohorts from 1953 to 1990 and relies on retrospective information. We observe an increase in absolute mobility for younger generations, which we relate to the structural expansion of education that created room at the top. In relative terms, mobility patterns remain more stable parental education is still a strong predictor of childrens educational achievement. The relationship is non-linear in both countries: persistence among very poorly and highly educated groups is strong, while individuals with parents of average education levels are more mobile. Upward mobility is stronger in Peru than in Chile: the chances to move from no formal education to higher education across one generation are 46% of the average in Peru compared to 20% in Chile. The chances of persisting in the top across generations are also slightly higher in Peru, with a factor of three times the average compared to 2.76 in Chile.",

We use income tax information on about 400,000 father-son pairs, and find intergenerational earnings elasticities to be about 0.2. Earnings mobility tends to be slightly greater than income mobility, but nonparametric techniques uncover significant nonlinearities in both of these relationships. Intergenerational earnings mobility is greater at the lower end of the income distribution than at the upper end, and displays an inverted V-shape elsewhere. Intergenerational income mobility follows roughly the same pattern, but is much lower at the very top of the income distribution.",
    "587": "Research on intergenerational economic mobility often ignores the geographic context of childhood, including neighborhood quality and local purchasing power. We hypothesize that individual variation in intergenerational mobility is partly attributable to regional and neighborhood conditions most notably access to high quality schools. Using restricted Panel Study of Income Dynamics and census data, we find that neighborhood income has roughly half the effect on future earnings as parental income. We estimate that lifetime household income would be $635,000 dollars higher if people born into a bottom quartile neighborhood would have been raised in a top quartile neighborhood. When incomes are adjusted to regional purchasing power, these effects become even larger. The neighborhood effect is two-thirds as large as the parental income effect and the lifetime earnings difference increases to $910,000. We test the robustness of these findings to various assumptions and alternative models and replicate the basic results using aggregated metropolitan level statistics of intergenerational income elasticities based on millions of IRS records.",

In economies characterized by intergenerational rigidities, an increase in incomeinequality has persistent effects-for example by hindering human capital accumulation-thereby retarding future growth disproportionately. We use several recently developedinternationally comparable measures of intergenerational mobility to confirm that thenegative impact of income inequality on growth is higher the lower is intergenerationalmobility. Our results suggest that omitting intergenerational mobility leads tomisspecification, shedding light on why the empirical literature on income inequality andgrowth has been so inconclusive.",

We exploit a unique dataset containing detailed information at the individual level for all people living in the Italian city of Florence in 1427. These individuals have been associated, using their surnames, with their pseudo-descendants living in Florence in 2011. We find that earnings elasticity is about 0.04, much higher than predicted by traditional models of intergenerational mobility. We also find an even stronger role for real wealth inheritance and evidence of persistence in belonging to certain elite professions. Our results are confirmed when we account for the quality of the pseudo-links and when we address the potential selectivity bias due to the differential survival rates across surnames. We argue that the quasi-immobility of pre-industrial society and the positional advantages in the access to certain professions might explain (in part) the long-lasting effects of ancestors' socioeconomic status.",
    "590": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the properties of the variable elasticity of substitution (VES) production function, and examine the dynamics of growth associated with it. Design/methodology/approach The VES production function is incorporated into an otherwise standard Diamond overlapping generations model. Findings Depending on parameter combinations, the economy can achieve a unique and stable steady state akin to that observed in the Solow-Swan model, reach a poverty trap or transition towards an upper bound of per capita capital stock. A special case of the VES production function is also consistent with unbounded growth. Research limitations/implications The paper is theoretical in nature. Further empirical analysis could shed deeper insights into the results presented in this study. Practical implications The VES production function, when applied to the context of the Diamond model, can capture a variety of growth experiences observed in the empirical literature. Social implications In the context of the Diamond model, a higher value of a particular parameter in the production function leads to greater intergenerational income and consumption inequality. Hence, the study provides a potential explanation for intergenerational inequalities observed in practice. Originality/value The study demonstrates the empirical value of the VES production function in explaining observed differences in factor shares, rewards and elasticities within and between countries over time.",
    "591": "In this paper, we abandon the stylized median voter and study (i) how distributional tensions can act in many different ways depending on social affinity and on the prospect of upward or downward mobility of the different income classes, (ii) income distribution dynamics, intergenerational community formation and growth. In a world in which redistributive policies, whether fiscal or educational, affect how the entire economy breaks up into different communities, we find multiple politico-economic regimes that are supported by new international empirical evidence. In particular, we highlight a political economy decision mechanism through which the pressure for redistribution can be highly non linear therefore providing an explanation as to why more inequality can be associated with less, rather than more, redistributive taxation. Our framework displays multiple steady states which depend on historical economic discrimination. We also provide sufficient conditions on the initial pattern of income distribution and local versus social spillovers ratio under which inequality and segregation persist in the long run.",

Our preferred estimates are that the intergenerational income elasticities are 0.74 for father-son, 0.84 for father-daughter, 0.33 for mother-son, and 0.47 for mother-daughter. This suggests that while China has experienced rapid growth of absolute incomes, the relative position of children in the distribution is largely determined by their parents' incomes. Investigating possible causal channels, we find that parental education, occupation, and Communist Party membership all play important roles in transmitting economic status from parents to children.",

Our estimates rely on a two-sample instrumental variables approach using representative data from the Japanese Social Stratification and Mobility (SSM) surveys, collected between 1965 and 2005. Father's income is predicted on the basis of a rich set of variables including education, occupation and job characteristics and we discuss changes in the Japanese earnings structure for cohorts born between the early 1900s and the 1960s. Our main results indicate that the intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) for both sons and daughters, in Japan lies around .35, which is an intermediate value, by international standards. We discuss the sensitivity of the IGE to using either personal or family income as the income variable for both fathers and children and perform some robustness analysis with respect to the first-step specification and to the age selection rule for children. We also examine changes across cohorts in the IGE. Results indicate that intergenerational mobility has been roughly stable over the last decades. Lastly, we estimate the intergenerational correlation of earnings.",
    "594": "We review studies of the impact of credit constraints on the accumulation of human capital. Evidence suggests that credit constraints have recently become important for schooling and other aspects of households' behavior. We highlight the importance of early childhood investments, as their response largely determines the impact of credit constraints on the overall lifetime acquisition of human capital. We also review the intergenerational literature and examine the macroeconomic impacts of credit constraints on social mobility and the income distribution. A common limitation across all areas of the human capital literature is the imposition of ad hoc constraints on credit. We propose a more careful treatment of the structure of government student loan programs and the incentive problems underlying private credit.

We examine this issue by focusing on the fortunes of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) - the historically disadvantaged and underprivileged castes in India. We find that since 1983, wages of SC/STs have been converging towards non-SC/ST levels with rising education attainment accounting for over 50 percent of this wage convergence. The occupation distribution of SC/STs has also been converging toward that of non-SC/STs. This period has also been marked by a sharp convergence in intergenerational education and income mobility rates of these two groups. Moreover, SC/STs have been switching occupations and industry of employment across generations at increasing rates. We conclude that the massive structural changes in India since the 1980s have proved hugely beneficial for SC/STs who have significantly narrowed their historical economic disparities with non-SC/STs during this period. In fact, relative incomes of SC/STs have become higher than the relative incomes of Blacks and Hispanics in the USA.",

We exploit a unique dataset containing detailed information at the individual level for all people living in the Italian city of Florence in 1427. These individuals have been associated, using their surnames, with their pseudo-descendants living in Florence in 2011. We find that long-run earnings elasticity is about 0.04; we also find an even stronger role for real wealth inheritance and evidence of persistence in belonging to certain elite occupations. Our results are confirmed when we account for the quality of the pseudo-links and when we address the potential selectivity bias behind the matching process. Finally, we frame our results within the existing evidence and argue that the quasi-immobility of preindustrial society and the existence of multigenerational effects might explain the long-lasting effects of ancestors socioeconomic status.",
    "597": "Research on intergenerational income mobility is based on current income since data on lifetime income are typically not available for two generations. However, using snapshots of income over shorter periods causes a so-called life-cycle bias if the snapshots cannot mimic lifetime outcomes. Using uniquely long series of Swedish income data, we show that current empirical strategies do not eliminate such bias. We focus on the widely adopted generalized errors-in-variables model and find that the remaining bias is substantial (20% of the true elasticity from left-side measurement error at the most relevant age range) IV estimates suffer from even stronger life-cycle effects and do not provide an upper bound. Inconsistencies stem from the interaction of two factors: heterogeneity in income profiles cannot be fully accounted for, and idiosyncratic deviations from average profiles correlate with individual characteristics and family background. We discuss implications of our findings for other literatures that depend on measurement of long-run income and income dynamics.",
    "598": "Despite a recent surge in the number of studies attempting to measure inequality of opportunity in various countries, methodological differences have so far prevented meaningful international comparisons. This paper presents a comparison of ex-ante measures of inequality of economic opportunity (IEO) across 41 countries, and of the Human Opportunity Index (HOI) for 39 countries. It also examines international correlations between these indices and output per capita, income inequality, and intergenerational mobility. The analysis finds evidence of a \"Kuznets curve\" for inequality of opportunity, and finds that the IEO index is positively correlated with overall income inequality, and negatively with measures of intergenerational mobility, both in incomes and in years of schooling. The HOI is highly correlated with the Human Development Index, and its internal measure of inequality of opportunity yields very different country rankings from the IEO measure.",
    "599": "We document novel, economically important correlations between children's future credit risk scores, default, and homeownership status and their parents' credit characteristics measured when the children are in their late teens. A one standard deviation higher parental credit risk score when the child is 19 is associated with a 24 percent reduction in the likelihood that the child goes bankrupt by age 29, a 36 percent lower likelihood of other serious default, a 35 point higher child credit score, and a 23 percent higher chance of the child becoming a homeowner. The linkages persist after controlling for parental income. The linkages are stronger in cities with lower intergenerational income mobility, implying that common factors might drive both. Existing measures of state-level educational policy have limited effects on the strength of the linkages. Evidence from a sample of siblings suggests that the linkages might be largely due to family fixed effects.",

The paper also shows that siblings' inequality seems to be independent of family wealth, which clearly contradicts the predictions of most economic models of resource allocation within the family.",
    "601": "argued that policies ending racial discrimination would not equalize opportunity without addressing residential sorting and neighborhood externalities. This paper studies related counterfactual policies using an overlapping-generations dynamic general equilibrium model of residential sorting and intergenerational human capital accumulation. In the model, households choose where to live and how much to invest toward the production of their child's human capital. The return on parents' investment is determined in part by the child's ability and in part by an externality determined by the human capital in their neighborhood. We calibrate the model with two neighborhoods and neighborhood-specific production technologies to data from Chicago when mobility was restricted by race. We then conduct three numerical experiments by eliminating the restriction on neighborhood choice, equalizing production technologies, or both. We find that allowing residential mobility generates persistent income inequality, even when technologies are equalized across neighborhoods. Equalizing technologies only equalizes opportunity for residents in the originally segregated neighborhood when high-income households reside there. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at improving outcomes in impoverished areas should feature incentives for high-income households to stay or migrate into the neighborhood.",

Occupationbased models of social mobility, however, have limitations that arguably have grown in recent decades. Metaanalysis of available evidence for Sweden, western Germany, and the United States concerning occupational mobility, household income mobility, job displacement, union dissolution, and poverty dynamics shows the limitations of the individuallevel occupationbased careertrajectory approach to life course mobility. This article develops an alternative formulation at the household level, which focuses on crossnational variation in the extent to which societal institutions influence the rate of events with the potential to change a household's life conditions via the manipulation of incentives for mobilitygenerating events, and the extent to which they mitigate the consequences of these events through social insurance. The combination of these institutional processes produces the distinctive characteristics of the mobility regimes of these countries.",
    "604": "We study the sources of racial disparities in income using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989 to 2015. We document three results. First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood have significantly better outcomes. However, less than 5% of black children grow up in such areas. Our findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.",
    "605": "Intergenerational mobility is often studied using survey data. In such settings, selective unit or item non-response may bias estimates. Linking Dutch survey data to administrative income data allows us to examine whether selective responses bias the estimated relationship between parental income and children's mathematics and language test scores in grades 6 and 9. We find that the estimates of these relationships are biased downward due to parental unit non-response, while they are biased upwards due to item non-response.In the analyses of both unit and item non-response, the point estimates for language and mathematics test scores point in the same direction but only one of the two relationships is significant. These findings suggest that estimates of intergenerational mobility based on survey data need to be interpreted with caution because they may be biased by selective non-response. The direction of such bias is difficult to predict a priori. Bias due to unit and item non-response may work in opposing directions and may differ across outcomes.",
    "606": "Atheoretical formulation derived from the cumulative advantage literature, that intergenerational educational mobility has enduring life-course income effects above and beyond individuals education, is empirically tested. This formulation contrasts sharply with both the human capital model, which does not consider parental education as a determinant of childrens income, and the sociological research on social mobility, which mostly relies on a snapshot view to study the economic consequences of educational mobility. To test this theory, we use NLSY79 survey data (with Panel Study of Income Dynamics data serving for robustness checks) We apply growth models to the data to estimate if and how the different intergenerational educational mobility groups that are produced by the intersection of parental and respondent education shape life-course income trajectories. Results provide evidence in support of the argument that the intersection of parental and respondent education bears important long-term income consequences, mainly for men. These results, moreover, do not vary by race. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications of our results.",
    "607": "Introduction and summary The large and persistent gap in economic status between blacks and whites in the United States has been a topic of considerable interest among social scientists and policymakers for many decades. The historical legacy of slavery and segregation raises the question of how long black Americans are likely to remain a disadvantaged minority. Despite the enormous literature on black-white inequality and its historical trends, few studies have directly measured black-white differences in rates of intergenerational mobility, that is, the ability of families to improve their position in the income distribution from one generation to the next. Estimates of rates of intergenerational mobility by race can provide insight on whether racial differences in the United States are likely to be eliminated and, if so, how long it might take. Furthermore, they might also help inform policymakers as to whether there are lingering racial differences in equality of opportunity and, if so, what the underlying sources for these differences are. More generally, the relatively low rate of intergenerational mobility in the United States compared with other industrialized countries has been a growing concern to policymakers across the political spectrum. (1) Understanding the sources of racial differences in intergenerational mobility might also shed light on the mechanisms behind the relatively high degree of intergenerational persistence of inequality in the United States. In this study, I attempt to advance our understanding along several dimensions. First, I use two data sets containing larger intergenerational samples than have been used in the previous literature. One of the data sets matches individuals in the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to administrative earnings records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) This matched data set provides many more years of data on parents' earnings than most surveys and is likely to be less prone to measurement error, since it is derived from tax records. In addition, the SIPP contains data on key characteristics of the parents, such as wealth levels and marital history. The other data source I use is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) In addition to containing a rich array of information as children transition from adolescence to adulthood, such as test scores and personality traits, the NLSY also measures total family income in both generations, giving it an advantage over the SIPP. Using a measure of economic status that includes the income of the spouse avoids selecting only women who participate in the labor market. Second, I use two types of measures of intergenerational mobility. The first is a set of transition probabilities of relative income status across generations. An example is the probability of moving out of the bottom quintile of the income distribution from one generation to the next. was the first to use transition probabilities to examine black-white differences in intergenerational mobility. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Hertz found that blacks were less upwardly mobile and more downwardly mobile over generations than whites. Since then, a few other studies mostly using the PSID have found similar results. (2) The second set of measures, called directional rank mobility, compares whether the rank of a child in the income distribution is higher or lower than their parents' rank in the previous generation. (3) Both types of measures are able to distinguish upward movements from downward ones and can be measured at different points in the income distribution. The directional rank mobility measure is a useful complement to the transition probability because instead of using an arbitrarily chosen cutoff, it uses a natural yardstick, one's own parents' rank. As I discuss later, the directional rank mobility measures also appear to be very robust to many measurement issues.",
    "608": "Families, labor markets, and public policies all structure a child's opportunities and determine the extent to which adult earnings are related to family background. Cross-country comparisons and the underlying trends suggest that these drivers will most likely lower the degree of intergenerational earnings mobility for the next generation of Americans coming of age in a more polarized labor market, while the substantial rise in the income shares of the top 1 percent, their access to sources of high-quality human capital investment for their children, and the intergenerational transmission of employers and wealth will imply a much higher rate of transmission of economic advantage at the very top.",
    "609": "Rich income data and a new methodology are employed to investigate patterns and consequences of spatial inequality in American cities over the last 35 years. New Gini-type indices, which assess spatial inequality using individual neighborhoods of variable size as primitives, uncover from the data robust evidence of growing income inequality within the neighborhood. The welfare implications of this trend are investigated through reduced-form models, addressing potential bias due to sorting across and within cities. An exogenous increase of the income mix in the neighborhood is found to yield a significant drop in intergenerational mobility gains for young people.",
    "610": "In this paper, we characterize the relationship between the initial distribution of human capital and physical inheritances among individuals and the long-run distribution of these two variables. In a model with indivisible investment in education, we analyze how the initial distribution of income determines the posterior intergenerational mobility in human capital and the evolution of intragenerational income inequality. This analysis enables us in turn to characterize the effects of scale policy on future income distribution and mobility when the composition of intergenerational transfers is endogenous. We nd that a tax on inheritance results in both less intergenerational mobility and smaller investment in human capital. However, a tax on labor income may promote human capital accumulation if the education premium is suffciently high.",
    "611": "This study estimates intergenerational correlations in mid-life wealth across three generations, and a young fourth generation, and examines how much of the parent-child association that can be explained by inheritances. Using a Swedish data set we find parent-child rank correlations of 0.30.4 and grandparents-grandchild rank correlations of 0.10.2. Conditional on parents' wealth, grandparents' wealth is weakly positively associated with grandchild's wealth and the parent-child correlation is basically unchanged if we control for grandparents' wealth. Bequests and gifts strikingly account for at least 50 per cent of the parent-child wealth correlation while earnings and education are only able to explain 25 per cent.",
    "612": "This paper estimates the causal effect of equalizing revenues across public school districts on students intergenerational mobility. I exploit differences in exposure to equalization across seven cohorts of students in 20 US states, generated by 13 state-level school finance reforms passed between 1980 and 2004. Since these reforms create incentives for households to sort across districts and this sorting affects property values, post-reform revenues are endogenous to an extent that varies across states. I address this issue with a simulated instruments approach, which uses newly collected data on states funding formulas to simulate revenues in the absence of sorting. I find that equalization has a large effect on mobility of low-income students, with no significant changes for high-income students. Reductions in the gaps in inputs (such as the number of teachers) and in college attendance between low-income and high-income districts are likely channels behind this effect.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",
    "613": "This paper examines theoretically how economic growth affects intergenerational economic mobility. In the model developed in this paper, education is provided to the individuals free of cost, and admission to schools is competitive. The quantity of educational services available in any period depends on the total output of the economy in the same period. Individuals differ from each other in two respects. First, their innate mental abilities are determined by a stochastic process, and, second, their parents have different education levels. Individuals are admitted to schools based on their potential. An individual's potential is a function of her innate mental ability and her parent's education level.In this model, economic growth increases intergenerational economic mobility if and only if the effect of having an educated parent on an individual's potentetial is not large. Moreover, if the effect of having an educated parent is not large, then there exists a unique steady state equilibrium and all economies will progress toward increased mobility. The model also shows that economic growth reduces the income difference between educated and uneducated labor if and only if the effect of having an educated parent on an individual's potential is not large. And, although population growth reduces intergenerational economic mobility, technological progress increases it.",

Using a large dataset of matched father-son pairs in Sweden we are able to obtain results for fractions as small as 0.1 percent of the population. Overall, mobility is lower for incomes than for earnings and it appears to decrease the higher up in the distribution one goes. In the case of incomes, however, we find that mobility decreases dramatically within the top percentile of the population. Our results suggest that Sweden, well-known for its egalitarian achievements, is a society where equality of opportunity for a large majority of wage earners coexists with capitalistic dynasties.",

Our subnational analysis finds that the national border only partially distinguishes the approximately 1,000 regions we analyze within these countries. The Canada-US border divides central and eastern Canada from the US Great Lakes and northeastern regions. Simultaneously, some Canadian regions have more in common with the low-mobility southern parts of the United States than with the rest of Canada; that these areas represent a much larger fraction of the US population also explains why mobility is lower in the United States.",
    "616": "Money parents give their adult children may be important for the financing of a child's education or a first home, relaxing binding credit constraints or responding to a transitory income shock. Financial transfers however, may extend economic disparities across generations if the wealthy transfer considerable resources to their children while middle class and poor households do not. In this paper, we first examine annual gifts of money from parents to adult children in the United States and ten European countries using the 2004 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) Second, utilizing the long panel of the HRS, we study the long-run behavior of parental monetary giving to children across families and within a family. We found that in all countries, some parents gave money to children, many did not, the amount was low, about 500 Euros annually per child, and varied by parental socio-economic status and public social expenditures. In the short term, parents in the U.S. gave money to a child to compensate for low earnings or satisfy an immediate need such as schooling. Over sixteen years, parents gave an average of about $38,000 to all their children, five percent gave over $140,000 and gave persistently. With time, the amount of money children in the same family received became more equal and a child's level of education was one of the few remaining sources of differences in money given to children. Overall, the annual amount of money parents gave adult children in any country was not enough to affect the distribution of resources within or between families in the next generation although the timing of transfers for schooling or housing may have a significant impact on an individual child. Annual parental transfers for college age children in school in the U.S. were substantially higher than average transfers to all children. The effect of parental transfers for higher education on intergenerational mobility in the U.S. will depend in part upon whether this financing is essential in the schooling decision.",
    "617": "This paper provides evidence on the degree and patterns of intergenerational income and educational mobility in urban Chile. We find intergenerational income elasticities for Greater Santiago in Chile in the range of 0.52 to 0.54. This is lower than recent nation-wide elasticities for Chile of about 0.6-0.7, but still stands as fairly high in comparison with the comparable international evidence. We also find that intergenerational educational mobility is lower for the younger cohorts, which however does not necessarily imply an increase of intergenerational educational mobility in the last decades, as life-cycle effects may be at work. Finally, we find evidence of a higher degree of intergenerational persistence of income at the two extremes of the income distribution, which is more accentuated at the top centiles of the distribution. We suggest that this may mirror the unusually high concentration of income at the top of the income distribution in Chile, a hypothesis that requires further research.",
    "618": "The relationship between inequality and trust has attracted the interest of many scholars who have found a negative relationship between the two variables. However, the causal link from inequality to trust is far from being identified and the existing empirical evidence admittedly remains weak, as the omitted variable bias, reverse causation and/or measurement error might be at work. In this paper, we reconsider the country-level evidence to address this issue. First, we exploit the panel dimension of the data, thus controlling for any country unobservable time-invariant variables. Second, we provide instrumental variable estimates using the predicted exposure to technological change as an exogenous driver of inequality. According to our findings, income inequality significantly and negatively affects generalised trust. However, this result only holds for developed countries. We also explore new insights on the effects of different dimensions of inequality, exploiting measures of both static inequality such as the Gini index and top income shares and dynamic inequality proxied by intergenerational income mobility.",

Differences among CZs in the relationship between parental income and children's human capital explain only one-ninth of the variation in income transmission. A similar share is explained by differences in the return to human capital. One-third reflects earnings differences not mediated by human capital, and 40% reflects differences in marriage patterns. Intergenerational mobility appears to reflect job networks and the structure of local labor and marriage markets more than it does the education system.",
    "620": "This paper considers the effect of a continuous treatment on the entire distribution of outcomes after adjusting for differences in the distribution of covariates across different levels of the treatment. Our methodology encompasses dose response functions, counterfactual distributions, and \"distributional policy effects'' depending on the assumptions invoked by the researcher. We propose a three-step estimator that consists of (i) estimating the distribution of the outcome conditional on the treatment and other covariates using quantile regression; (ii) for each value of the treatment, averaging over a counterfactual distribution of the covariates holding the treatment fixed; (iii) manipulating the counterfactual distribution into a parameter of interest. We show that our estimators converge uniformly to Gaussian processes and that the empirical bootstrap can be used to conduct uniformly valid inference across a range of values of the treatment. We use our method to study intergenerational income mobility where we consider distributional effects of parents' income on child's income such as (i) the fraction of children with income below the poverty line, (ii) the variance of child's income, and (iii) the inter-quantile range of child's income -- all as a function of parents' income.",
    "621": "On average, children from less economically privileged households have lower levels of educational attainment than their higher income peers, and this association has important implications for intergenerational mobility and equality of opportunity. Using a large national data set that recently added information on genetic markers, this paper shows that the income-achievement relationship varies greatly across groups of children with different versions of a single gene, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) For children with one variant of MAOA, increases in household income have the expected large positive association with college enrollment, college graduation, and total years of schooling completed. For children with another variant of MAOA, who comprise over half of the population, there is virtually no relationship between economic background and educational attainment. These results hold when the interactive effects are identified using MAOA variation between full biological siblings, which genetic principles assure is as good as randomly assigned. Implications for policy design and future research are discussed.",
    "622": "Research on intergenerational income mobility has shown stronger persistence between parental and offspring's income in the UK than in Sweden. We use similar data sets for the two countries to explore whether these cross-national differences show up already early in offspring's life in outcomes such as birth weight, grades at the end of compulsory school at age 16, height during adolescence, and final educational attainment. We do indeed find significant country differences in the association between parental income and these outcomes, and the associations are stronger in the UK than in Sweden.Therefore, we continue to investigate whether these differentials are large enough to account for a substantial part of the difference in intergenerational persistence estimates. We then conclude that the country differences in the intergenerational associations in birth weight and height are too weak to account for hardly any fraction of the UK-Sweden difference in intergenerational income mobility. For the more traditional human-capital variables grades and final education, however, our results suggest that the country differences can account for a substantial part of the difference in income persistence.",
    "623": "Sibling correlations are used as overall measures of the impact of family background and community influences on individual outcomes. While most correlation studies show that siblings are quite similar in terms of future achievement, we lack specific knowledge of what it is about family background that really matters. Studies on intergenerational income mobility show that parental income matters to some extent, but they also show that more than half of the family background and community influences that siblings share are not even correlated with parental income. In this paper, we employ a data set that contains rich information about families in order to explore what factors in addition to parental income can explain why siblings tend to have such similar outcomes. Our results show that measures of family structure and social problems account for very little of sibling similarities in adult income above and beyond that already accounted for by parental income. However, when we add a set of indicators for parental involvement and attitudes, the explanatory power of all our variables increased from about a third (using only traditional indicators of socio-economic status) to just over half. Interestingly, indicators of parents' patience, i.e. propensity to plan ahead and willingness to postpone benefits to the future, are particularly important.",
    "624": "Since the founding of our nation, education has been valued as a preeminent means of achieving equal opportunity and the social mobility of democracy. A generation ago, however, Professor John Langbein diagnosed a different function of education: the transmission of wealth from one generation to the next. In this article, I examine education as intergenerational wealth transmission through a critical lens. My primary inquiry is whether the traditional role of education-as-opportunity is being crowded out by education-as-inheritance. The article first examines and verifies Langbeins diagnosis: Education today is indeed an important way to transfer wealth intergenerationally. The article next documents lack of access to education for those without economic resources, a lack of access that extends from birth through college. The article concludes by identifying flagging public investment in education as creating a vacuum that is being filled by the increasingly privatized provision of education. This privatized investment constitutes an indirect but real form of intergenerational wealth transmission, which dampens social mobility. Countering this trend, increasing social mobility will necessitate a shift away from education-as-inheritance toward education-as-opportunity. More progressive public investment at all levels of education is called for to facilitate this shift.",

Empirically, the question is brought down to an application with US General Social Survey data. For the identification of a causal relationship, I use a structural approach and estimate a recursive bivariate probit that controls for selection on unobservables. Results suggest that trust increases if children have achieved an upward income movement away from their parents' income position, and it decreases with the experience of downward income mobility. Policy implications are also discussed.",
    "626": "We develop a dynamic model where a competitive firm produces a single good from labor and capital, with market clearing rates of return. Individuals are heterogeneous in skills, with an endowment in capital/wealth increasing in skill. Individuals aspire to a standard consumption level, with a constant marginal propensity to consume out of income above this level. We define a steady state of this model as an equilibrium where factor returns and wealth shares remain constant. We calibrate the model to the US economy and obtain that a steady state exists. We then study three variants of the model: one with a higher rate of return for large capitals than for smaller ones, one with social mobility, and one with a capital levy Financing a lump sum transfer. In all variants, a steady state exists. We also run the model starting from the 2012 US wealth distribution and obtain convergence to the steady state in the basic model as well as in all variants. Convergence takes a long time and is non monotone, with factor returns and wealth shares moving away from their steady state values for long periods.",
    "627": "Ideal estimates of the IGE (IGE) in income require a large panel of income data covering the entire working lifetimes for two generations. Previous studies have demonstrated that using short panels and covering only certain portions of the lifecycle can lead to considerable bias. I address these biases by using the PSID and constructing long time averages centered at age 40 in both generations. I find that the IGE in family income in the U.S. is likely greater than 0.6 suggesting a relatively low rate of intergenerational mobility in the U.S. I find similar sized estimates for the IGE in labor income. These estimates support the prior findings of Mazumder (2005a, b) and are also similar to comparable estimates reported by Mitnik et al. (2015) In contrast, a recent influential study by Chetty et al. (2014) using tax data that begins in 1996, estimates the IGE in family income for the U.S. to be just 0.344 implying a much higher rate of intergenerational mobility. I demonstrate that despite the seeming advantages of extremely large samples of administrative tax data, the age structure and limited panel dimension of the data used by Chetty et al. leads to considerable downward bias in estimating the IGE. I further demonstrate that the sensitivity checks in Chetty et al. regarding the age at which children's income is measured, and the length of the time average of parent income used to estimate the IGE, are also flawed due to these data limitations. There are also concerns that tax data, unlike survey data, may not adequately reflect all sources of family income. Estimates of the rank-rank slope, Chetty et al.'s preferred estimator, are more robust to the limitations of the tax data but are also downward biased and modestly overstate mobility. However, Chetty et al.'s main findings of sizable geographic differences within the U.S. in rank mobility, are unlikely to be affected by these biases. I conclude that researchers should continue to use both the IGE and rank based measures depending on their preferred concept of mobility. It also important for researchers to have adequate coverage of key portions of the lifecycle and to consider the possible drawbacks of using administrative data.",
    "628": "In this paper, we build a model that, according to the empirical evidence, gives raise to oscillations in wealth within a dynasty while keeping inter-generational persistence in education attainment. The mechanism that we propose is based on the interaction between effort and wealth suggested by the Carnegie effect, according to which wealthier individuals make less effort than the poorer. The oscillations in wealth arise from changes in the effort exerted by different generations as a response to both inherited wealth and college premium. Our mechanism generates a rich social stratification with several classes in the long run as a consequence of the combination of different levels of education and effort. Furthermore, we generate a large mobility in wealth among classes even in the long run. Our model highlights the role played by the minimum cost on education investment, the borrowing constraints, and the complementarity between effort and education.",

Using panel data for three birth cohorts of young adults from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey, the estimated intergenerational income elasticity is 0.28. Correcting for attenuation bias raises this to 0.41. We estimate the rank correlation to be 0.27. We show that Australia has greater mobility than the US and this is not sensitive to methodological choices. We also show that spousal selection and family structure may be important determinants of income persistence across generations.",

Using the CHNS database which gives information on parental educational attainment and income level, I show that there is a relatively high intergenerational mobility in China, compared to other developed and developing countries. Even if parents' social characteristics influence the child's ones, the transmission of parents' educational and income level remains low. Nevertheless, I stress a growing impact of parents' income on the determination of children educational attainment, what can be an increasing factor of income inequality in the future. Moreover, I emphasize that parents' farming activity plays an important and significant negative role in the child's educational level.",
    "631": "We build a model that, according to the empirical evidence, gives rise to oscillations in wealth within a dynasty while keeping intergenerational persistence in education attainment. We propose a mechanism based on the interaction between wealth and eort as suggested by the Carnegie conjecture, according to which wealthier individuals devote less eort in their job occupations than poorer. Oscillations in wealth arise from changes in the occupation chosen by dierent generations of the same dynasty as a response to both inherited wealth and college premium. Our mechanism generates a rich social stratiOcation with several classes in the long run due to the combination of dierent levels of education and occupation types. Furthermore, we generate a large mobility in wealth among classes even in the long run. Our model highlights the role played by the minimum cost on education investment, the borrowing constraints, and the complementarity between education and occupational eort.",

We measure social mobility with intergenerational income elasticities, associations between fathers' and sons' income percentiles, and brother correlations. All approaches suggest that social mobility increased substantially between cohorts born in the early 1930s and the early 1940s. Father-son associations remained stable for cohorts born after WWII, while brother correlations continued to decline. The relationship between fathers' and sons' income percentile ranks is highly nonlinear for the early cohorts, but approaches linearity over time. We discuss increasing educational attainment among low- and middle-income families as a possible mechanism behind these trends.",

The twostage method presented here first estimates proxies for fathers and sons lifetime family incomes from annual income observations, schooling and race; and then uses these income proxies to derive mobility measures. Applying this to United States PSID data for sons born between 1952 and 1981, we find a decline in intergenerational mobility in lifetime family income, as measured by the IGE of income, the rankrank correlation, absolute upward mobility, and other indicators.",
    "634": "This paper joins a growing body of research linking measures of the physical environment to population well-being, with a focus on neighborhood toxins. Extending a national database on the social mobility of American children growing up in over 70,000 Census tracts, we explore the association between childhood exposure to two forms of pollutants and three socioeconomic outcomes for African Americans, whites, and Latinos. We find that children who grew up in Census tracts with higher levels of traffic-related air pollution and housing-derived lead risk experienced lower adult incomes on average relative to their parents and higher likelihoods of being incarcerated as an adult or having children as teenagers, after controlling for standard socio-demographic characteristics and metropolitan-level effects. The spatial distribution of these two pollutants is surprisingly different, however, with air pollution varying mostly between regions of the country while lead risk varies dramatically between neighborhoods within the same city. Yet, each pollutant predicts the three aspects of social mobility similarly, and we show important disparities in exposure by race. Differential exposure to environmental toxins in childhood may be a contributor to racial inequality in socioeconomic outcomes among adults.",

    "636": "Research has repeatedly argued that increasing the rate at which Black people start businesses could reduce the racial wealth gap between Black and white families, but increasing the rate of Black entrepreneurship may actually exacerbate the racial wealth gap, due to the economic cost associated with business closure. Using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) we find that, as past work suggests, Black-owned businesses are less likely to remain open 4 years later, compared to white-owned businesses, and that, due to this disparity, Black business owners are more likely to experience downward economic mobility and less likely to experience upward mobility, compared to their white counterparts. These results suggest that improving the rate at which Black entrepreneurs succeed, rather than increasing the rate at which Black people become entrepreneurs, should be the target of efforts to leverage business ownership to reduce the racial wealth gap.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s41996-021-00081-6.",

    "638": "We present a first formal, dynamic, economic analysis of reparations using a long-run model of heterogeneous dynasties with an occupational choice and bequests. Our innovation is to introduce endogenous dispersion of beliefs about risky returns, reflecting differences in dynasties' investment experiences over time. Feeding the exclusion of Black dynasties from labor and capital markets as driving force, the model quantitatively reproduces current and historical racial gaps in wealth, income, entrepreneurship, mobility, and beliefs about risky returns. We evaluate whether different forms of reparations compensate for historical exclusions, which means restoring the long-run outcomes we would have observed in the absence of exclusions. We find that direct transfers that eliminate the racial gap in average wealth today do not lead to long-run wealth convergence, which is the long-run outcome without exclusions. The logic is that century-long exclusions lead Black dynasties to enter into reparations with pessimistic beliefs about risky returns and to forego investment opportunities. We show that investment subsidies are more effective than wealth transfers in eliminating the racial wealth gap.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

Using the method of TS2SLS, this paper estimates the overall and the structure of intergenerational income mobility in recent China. After careful consideration of potential lifecycle, attenuation and coresidence biases, our preferred intergenerational income elasticity is 0.41 for fatherchildren and 0.56 for motherchildren, which suggests a low level of intergenerational mobility. We then focus on the structure of the mobility regarding age cohort, gender, ethnicity, region, registration type and income percentile. By investigating possible channels, our results show that (a) the role of noncognitive characteristics, cognitive abilities, education, occupation and party membership jointly account for nearly 63% of intergenerational transmission, (b) education and occupation are two dominant channels, and (c) noncognitive characteristics and cognitive abilities have direct and indirect effects on intergenerational transmission.",

Finally, the source of wealth inequality seems to affect differently people preferences for mobility in the two mobility scenarios.",

This paper examines the changes in intergenerational mobility in Denmark, which has one of the highest levels of intergenerational mobility in the world. We show that mobility has been declining for both men and women since the late 1950s across the most recent cohorts who are now old enough to measure permanent adult income, and that these changes were concentrated among children born into the middle three-fifths of the income distribution. We examine the sources of this decline by testing hypotheses related to demographic processes, returns to education, and work experience. Our results highlight the importance of both parent and child work experience and family structure in the family of origin among both men and women as well as, to a lesser degree, marital status, assortative mating, and childbearing among women. Although education was an important driver of parent-child income rank associations (IRA) in each cohort, it played little role in accounting for increases in those associations across cohorts.",

We estimate that a child with parental income below the median is expected to belong to the 44th percentile of its own income distribution as an adult, and the probability of moving from the bottom to the top quintile of the income distribution within a generation is 0.10. The rank-rank correlation is 0.25, and rank persistence at the top is significantly higher than elsewhere in the income distribution.Upward mobility is higher for sons, first-born children, children of self-employed parents, and for those who migrate once adults. The data reveal large variation in child outcomes conditional on parental income rank. Part of this variation is explained by the location where the child grew up. Provinces in Northern Italy, the richest area of the country, display upward mobility levels 3-4 times as large as those in the South. This regional variation is strongly correlated with local labor market conditions, indicators of family instability, and school quality.",

Both endogenous and exogenous growth versions of the basic OLG model are analyzed. We find that intergenerational redistribution policies that discourage physical capital formation may encourage human capital formation. Despite common technologies and perfect international mobility of financial capital, the non- tradedness of human capital and the illiquidity of human wealth make for persistent differences in productivity growth rates (in the endogenous growth version of the model) or in their levels (in the exogenous growth version) We also consider the productivity growth (or level) effects of public spending on education and of the distortionary taxation of financial asset income.",

This result appears to stem from large banks' comparative disadvantage using soft information, which is particularly important for lending to low income households. In contrast, the size of local banks has little or no effect on high income households. Consistent with low income parents' credit constraints limiting investment in their children's human capital, areas with larger banks exhibit a greater sensitivity of educational attainment to parental income, and less intergenerational economic mobility.",
    "646": "This dissertation consists of three contributions. Each addresses one specific aspect of intergenerational income mobility and is intended to be a stand-alone analysis. All chapters use comparable data for Germany and the United States to conduct country comparisons. As there are usually a large number of studies available for the United States, this approach is useful for comparing the empirical results to the existing literature. The first part conducts a direct country comparison of the structure and extent of intergenerational income mobility in Germany and the United States. In line with existing results, the estimated intergenerational income mobility of 0.49 in the United States is significantly higher than that of 0.31 in Germany. While the results for the intergenerational rank mobility are relatively similar, the level of intergenerational income share mobility is higher in the United States than in Germany. There are no significant indications of a nonlinear run of intergenerational income elasticity. A final decomposition of intergenerational income inequality shows both greater income mobility and stronger progressive income growth for Germany compared to the United States. Overall, no clear ranking of the two countries can be identified. To conclude, several economic policy recommendations to increase intergenerational income mobility in Germany are discussed. The second part examines the transmission channels of intergenerational income persistence in Germany and the United States. In principle, there are two ways in which well-off families may influence the adult incomes of their children: first through direct investments in their children's human capital (investment effect ) and second through the indirect transmission of human capital from parents to children (endowment effect ) In order to disentangle these two effects, a descriptive as well as a structural decomposition method are utilized. The results suggest that the investment effect and the endowment effect each account for approximately half of the estimated intergenerational income elasticity in Germany, while the investment effect is substantially more influential in the United States with a share of around 70 percent. With regard to economic policy, these results imply that equality of opportunity for children born to poor parents cannot be reached by the supply of financial means alone. Conversely, an efficient policy must additionally substitute for the missing direct transmission of human capital within socio-economically weak families. The third part explicitly focuses on the intergenerational income mobility among daughters. The restriction to men is commonly made in the empirical literature due to womens lower labor market participation. While most men work full-time, the majority of (married) women still work only part-time or not at all. Especially with the occurrence of assortative mating, daughters from well-off families are likely to marry rich men and might decide to reduce their labor supply as a result. Thus, the individual labor income of a daughter might not be a good indicator for her actual economic status. The baseline regression analysis shows a higher intergenerational income elasticity in Germany and a lower intergenerational income elasticity in the United States for women as compared to men. However, a separation by marital status reveals that in both countries unmarried women exhibit a higher intergenerational income elasticity than unmarried men, while married women feature a lower intergenerational income elasticity than married men. The reason for the lower mobility of unmarried women turns out to be a stronger human capital transmission from fathers to daughters than to sons. The higher mobility of married women is driven by a weaker human capital transmission and a higher labor supply elasticity with respect to spousal income for women as compared to men. In order to further study the effects of assortative mating, the subsample of married children is analyzed by different types of income. It shows that the estimated intergenerational income elasticity of children's household incomes is even higher than that of their individual incomes. This can be seen as an indication for strong assortative mating. If household income is interpreted as a measure of childrens actual economic welfare, there are barely any differences between sons and daughters. The intergenerational income elasticity of spousal income with respect to parental income is again relatively high, which in turn supports the hypothesis of strong assortative mating. The elasticity of the sons-in-law with respect to their fathers-in-law in Germany is even higher than that of the sons with respect to their own fathers.",

Higher substitutability between public and private investments induces smaller damages in the aggregate economy and the affected childrens lifetime income while exacerbating negative impacts on intergenerational mobility and inequality.

I exploit a large quasi-natural policy experiment that led to variation across time and space in exposure to cross-border immigrants: The incremental removal of restrictions for cross-border immigrants in Switzerland in regions close to the border. The study draws from several administrative data covering the universe of labor income, family linkages, and census data. Results show that children from low-income parents experience a stronger decrease in labor income than children from high-income backgrounds. While children from the bottom quintile experience a 3 to 6 percent decrease in labor income, the effect for children from the top quintile is close to zero or slightly positive. Subsequently, intergenerational income mobility, measured as the rank difference between children from the lowest and the highest parent percentile, decreases by 1.5 percentile ranks or 12 percent in relative terms. The income of children from low-income backgrounds decreases more because they are more likely to learn occupations and to choose educational tracks which are more negatively affected by the immigrant influx. Also, there is no adaption in educational or occupational choices that could mitigate the negative labor income effect.",

Economic studies 177. 125 pp. Uppsala: Department of Economics, Uppsala University. ISBN 978-91-506-2733-6. Essay I: A body of evidence has emerged in the literature on intergenerational mobility documenting that unequal countries experience less social mobility: a relationship known as the Great Gatsby Curve. In this paper I estimate the Great Gatsby Curve within Sweden across 125 commuting zones and 20 cohorts, exploiting both cross-sectional and longitudinal variation. I find that children who were exposed to higher levels of inequality during childhood experienced less social mobility as adults, thereby confirming the existence of a Great Gatsby Curve in Sweden. I also present new evidence on the underlying mechanisms of the Great Gatsby Curve. By decomposing intergenerational mobility into separate transmission channels, I find that the Great Gatsby Curve is exclusively driven by the mediating effect that children's educational attainment and development of cognitive and non-cognitive skills has on the persistence of income across generations. Hence, the results suggest that adverse effects of inequality on mobility can be alleviated by policies that target children's educational attainment and development of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Essay II: The causal effects of student aid on educational attainment and subsequent labor market outcomes is estimated by exploiting the repeal of the Recruitment Grant in 2006 in a difference-in-differences framework. The purpose of the Recruitment Grant was to increase enrollment in adult education among unemployed adults with incomplete upper secondary education, and thereby improve their prospects on the labor market. The grant replaced the loans in the national student aid system, and as such offers an opportunity to study the effects of student aid when credits constraints are absent. I find that the repeal of the Recruitment Grant reduced enrollment in adult education by 10 percent in the target population relative to the pretreatment enrollment rate, and that the number of passed credits decreased by 28 percent. In terms of labor market outcomes, the repeal increased the unemployment rate by 3.2 percentage points in the target population in 2008, and by 2.1 percentage points in 2009. Focusing on long term outcomes, I find that the repeal decreased average labor market income between 2012 and 2014 by about $280 while increasing the number of days in unemployment by 27.2 days in the same period. In sum, the repeal of the Recruitment Grant had sizable adverse effects for the target population. Essay III (with Mikael Lindahl and Bjorn Ockert): This paper provides evidence on the importance of nature-nurture interactions for socio-economic outcomes, using administrative data on adopted children and their adoptive and biological parents. We study a large sample of adoptees born in Sweden 1932-1970, and use the education and income of the biological and adoptive parents as proxies for pre-birth and post-birth factors, respectively. The estimated interaction effects are typically non-positive and small: they account for around 510 percent of the overall intergenerational transmission. However, the interaction effects between pre-birth and post-birth factors are statistically significant and negative for educational attainment for sons and for the earlier cohorts. We find similar results if we instead treat childrens genetic and environmental background as unobserved latent variables. Thus, we do not find that a poor upbringing exacerbates any genetic disadvantages. Instead, a favorable family environment is likely to improve life chances for everyone, regardless of their genetic predisposition.

    "658": "Purpose of the Study: The research aimed to investigate the role of tribal identity in the economic mobility of the people in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Tribal identity is an important determinant of socio-status among the people living in the province and the adjacent areas bordering Afghanistan. This research argues that membership of a tribe either facilitates or constrains the upward economic mobility of people in this part of Pakistan. Methodology: To affirm the aforementioned arguments, the research has used primary data composed of 61 households through random sampling technique via formal survey from an important and representative town of the province, i.e. Utmanzai, District Charsadda. Two kinds of analysis were employed for estimation purposes. First, the demographics profile was used and second econometrics techniques of Principle Component Analysis and Simple Regression Model were used. Main Findings: The findings of the research study showed that tribal identity is a significant factor in determining the economic mobility among the people of the town because the majority tribe has better access to education particularly at a higher level of education. The findings obtained from the employment level shows lack of decent employment opportunities for minority tribe. It was also found that the majority tribe has more access to credit facilities while minority tribe accessing and availing of credit easy while minority tribe found access to credit difficult for the reason of low-income levels, lack of collateral, and high-interest rate. Applications of the Study: The current study contributes to knowledge by explaining intergenerational economic mobility through tribal identity even though they profess the same religion, speak the same language, belong to the same ethnic group, and have the same skin color. Novelty/Originality of this study: The study finds that peoples socioeconomic attributes are highly dependent upon their tribal identity.",

We then investigate the parents' role in children's income dynamicsthe intergenerational transmission of income dynamics. We find that children of high-income, high-wealth fathers enjoy steeper income growth over the life cycle and face more volatile but more positively skewed income changes, suggesting that they are more likely to pursue high-return, high-risk careers. Children of poorer fathers also face more volatile incomes, but theirs grow more gradually and are more left skewed. Furthermore, the income dynamics of fathers and children are strongly correlated. In particular, children of fathers with steeper life-cycle income growth, more volatile incomes, or higher downside risk also have income streams of similar properties. We also confirm that fathers' significant role in workers' income dynamics is not simply spurious because of omitted variables, such as workers' own permanent income. These findings shed new light on the determinants of intergenerational mobility.",
    "660": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of intergenerational income mobility in Sweden. Intergenerational income mobility is considered in both relative and absolute terms, and the analysis is carried out at the individual and municipality level. We use multilevel models to explore the correlation between upward mobility and social, economic and demographic characteristics of cities. We account for a wider set of local characteristics, such as the spatial distribution of income inequality within city and housing affordability that have not been considered by previous studies analysing social mobility in the United States or other European countries. The analyses are carried out on three subpopulations: offspring who live in a different municipality than their parents (spatial mobile population); offspring who live in the municipality where they grew up (spatial immobile population); offspring belonging to visible minority groups. Our results show substantial differences across municipalities, meaning that the particular combination of municipality attributes contributes to shaping the chance of status attainment among young generations. Highly mobile municipalities have more significant human capital, more residential segregation by income, more local levels of income inequality, and greater accessibility to jobs. The results indicate that dependence on parents' support and network for upward mobility is of less importance, and that spatial mobility (regardless of background) especially to larger urban areas is associated with upward mobility for the children.",
    "661": "Recent scholarship on mobility has increasingly incorporated wealth. We ask if wealth brings anything new to mobility research or is just a standard socioeconomic status (SES) dimension in disguise. We exploit Swedish administrative registers, which contain rich SES measures over individuals lives for both parents and childrens generations. Using sibling correlations to estimate a baseline of shared family background influence, we then perform a total decomposition for each SES dimension and their overlaps. We find that wealth is a distinct dimension of SES that is very different from education, occupation, and income. Parental wealth cannot be substituted for other SES dimensions in understanding childs wealth attainment. Moreover, parental wealth substantially moderates intergenerational reproduction in other dimensions: The wealthiest have higher reproduction rates in all child outcomes, but in particular for childrens income and wealth. Excluding wealth leads to underestimating intergenerational inequality, aggravated by its qualitatively unique status as an SES resource. We conclude thatalongside the SES resources education, occupation, and incomewealth emerges as an integral and unique dimension of what we choose to call the big four of social stratification.",
    "662": "Elite college attendance significantly impacts students' entrepreneurship decisions and career dynamics. We find that an elite college degree is positively correlated with entrepreneurship (i.e. owning an incorporated business) but not with other self-employment forms. Our overlapping generations model captures self-selection in education and career choices based on heterogeneous ability and family wealth endowments over the life-cycle. Our estimates show that (1) entrepreneurs and other self-employed individuals require different types of human capital, and (2) elite colleges generate considerably more human capital gain than ordinary colleges, particularly for entrepreneurs. Distinguishing between elite and ordinary colleges improves our prediction of entrepreneurship decisions. Providing subsidies for elite colleges is more efficient than subsidizing their ordinary counterparts to encourage entrepreneurship, enhance intergenerational mobility, and enhance welfare. In contrast, although start-up subsidy increases entrepreneurship, it does not improve their performance, and it is inferior to education subsidy in generating efficiency, equality, and intergenerational mobility.",

These findings are robust with respect to a wide range of identifying assumptions. The analysis is based on high-quality population-wide administrative data from Norway, which is one of the rich-world countries with the most rapid rise in the immigrant population share over the past two decades.

    "665": "Using nationally representative longitudinal household survey data, this study finds that Chinas one-child policy (OCP) one of the most extreme forms of birth control in recorded history, has amplified the intergenerational transmission of inequality in the country. Rural/poor Chinese families, whose fertility choices are less constrained by the OCP than those of urban/rich ones, have more children but invest less in their human capital. Since education is a major determinant of earnings, income inequality persists and increases across generations. Our results also show that the OCP accounts for 35.4%51.5% of the decline in intergenerational income mobility in recent decades.",

Using the unit-level records of National Sample Survey data, the present study attempts to examine relative and absolute income mobility by way of segregating generations into social groups and income classes. The originality of the article lies in assessing the IGIM using different approaches, which will contribute to the existing literature. We conclude that the country has low-income mobility and high inequality which is no longer associated with a particular social group in India. Moreover, the relationship between income inequality and intergenerational mobility is both negative and positive. JEL Codes: D63, J62, R13",

We study the occupational mobility for the CEOs of Sweden's 30 largest public firms since 1945. The study is based on a data set consisting of 229 former and current CEOs who were born between the late 1800s and 1970. We have information about paternal occupations for 185 (81%) of them. 60% grew up in Social Group I, which implies an overrepresentation for Social Group I by a factor of 9.7. Consequently, Social Groups II and III are underrepresented. However, almost four out of ten CEOs born in the 1940s came from Social Group III and toward the end of the period, the share coming from Social Group II roughly doubled to 35%",

We match the universe of labor incomes over generations and add census and survey data. Using over 900,000 observations from 18 cohorts (1967-1984) we show that income mobility in terms of rank-rank slope (0.14) is higher than in the US and even higher than in Nordic countries. At the same time, educational mobility is low. This shows that low educational mobility does not need to translate into low income mobility. We find high income mobility for individuals with vocational education and training (VET) suggesting that the divergence between educational and income mobility is due to the prominent VET system. Further, children of immigrants show higher mobility rates than children of Swiss born parents. Besides, regions with higher public expenditures, lower tax rates, and higher income inequality exhibit greater income mobility.",

Data come from the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study in Korea and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in the US.

    "670": "Are children better off than their parents? This highly debated question in politics and economics is investigated by analysing the trends in absolute and relative intergenerational labour income mobility for Germany and the US. High quality panel data is used for this purpose; the SOEP for Germany and the PSID for the US. In Germany, 67 per cent of sons born between 1955 and 1975 earned a significantly higher wage or salary than their fathers: Those with fathers from the lowest earnings bracket were particularly mobile in absolute terms. In contrast, the fraction of US sons earning more than their fathers is 60 per cent on average for the same cohorts. Their share decreased from 66 per cent in the 1956-60 birth cohort to 48 per cent in the 1971-75 birth cohort, while it almost did not change in Germany. Overall, absolute but also relative labour income mobility are larger in Germany than in the US. This indicates that economic growth has been distributed more broadly in Germany than in the US. While the majority of German males has been able to share in the countrys rising prosperity and are better off than their fathers, US males continue to lose ground. Hence, Chetty et al. (2017) seem to be right when they say that the American Dream is slowly fading away.",

Our measure of educational attainment is the A-Level degree, a requirement for access to university. A 10 percentile increase in the parental income rank is associated with a 5.2 percentage point increase in the A-Level share. This parental income gradient has not changed for the birth cohorts of 1980-1996, despite a large-scale policy of expanding upper secondary education. At the regional level, there exists substantial variation in mobility estimates. Place effects, rather than sorting of households, account for most of these differences.",

In particular, two-stage techniques are widely used to impute parental incomes for analyses of lower-income countries and for estimating long-run trends across multiple generations and historical periods. We propose applying machine learning methods to improve the reliability and comparability of such estimates. Supervised learning algorithms minimize the out-of-sample prediction error in the parental income imputation and provide an objective criterion for choosing across different specifications of the first-stage equation. We use our approach on data from the United States and South Africa to show that under common conditions it can limit the bias generally associated to mobility estimates based on imputed parental income.",
    "673": "Where an individual grows up has large implications for their long-term economic outcomes, including earnings and intergenerational mobility. Even within the United States, the \"causal effect of place\" varies greatly and cannot be fully explained by socioeconomic conditions. Across different nations, variation in growth and mobility have been linked to more individualistic cultures. We assess how variation of historically driven individualism within the United States affects mobility. Areas in the United States that were isolated on the frontier for longer periods of time during the 19th century have a stronger culture of \"rugged individualism\" [S. Bazzi, M. Fiszbein, M. Gebresilasse, Econometrica 88, 2329-2368 (2020)] We combine county-level measures of frontier experience with modern measures of the causal effect of place on mobility-the predicted percentage change in an individual's earnings at age 26 y associated with \"growing up\" in a particular county [R. Chetty, N. Hendren, Q. J. Econ. 133, 1163-1228 (2018)] Using commuting zone fixed effects and a suite of county-level controls to absorb regional variation in frontier experience and modern economic conditions, we find an additional decade of frontier experience results in 25% greater modern-day income mobility for children of parents in the 25th percentile of income and 14% for those born to parents in the 75th percentile. We use mediation analysis to present suggestive evidence that informal manifestations of \"rugged individualism\"-those embodied by the individuals themselves-are more strongly associated with upward mobility than formal policy or selective migration.",
    "674": "We propose a new and simple method to study intergenerational wealth correlation between two generations, which is easy to implement in wealth (and housing) surveys and aims at overcoming the strong data limitation faced in most of the countries. We show that the ownership of housing assets can be used to proxy for three wealth groups for all cohorts. Misclassification induces a low and downward bias in the estimate of the intergenerational correlation. Using France as an example, we estimate intergenerational wealth correlation for cohorts covering the 20th century and focus on the wealth positions measured at the mid-life cycle of both children and parents. First, probabilities to belong to top wealth groups are increasing with the wealth of the parents. This intergenerational correlation has increased over time for most of the top wealth groups. Second, the higher we move up along the childrens wealth distribution, the larger the role of parental wealth: the persistence in the top 50% is 38% higher than under perfect mobility and the deviations from perfect mobility are larger in higher top wealth groups. Third, 50 to 60% of the correlation is accounted for by a mix of intergenerational wealth transfers, fathers occupation and childrens education. Fourth, gifts and bequests explain a larger share of the link between parental wealth and the probability to belong to the top 10% compared to larger top wealth groups. We also find evidence of persistence of the effect of parental wealth over the life-cycle.",
    "675": "The United States has long presented itself as a meritocracy, a society that rewards talent and effort. The American Dream, as originally formulated by a historian in the 1930s, was being able to grow to [ones] fullest development, unhampered by background.1 Faith in that meritocratic ideal persists, despite increasing inequality and awareness of bias based on race, class, gender, and other background characteristics. In recent polls, between two-thirds and three-quarters of people said that they believe in the American Dream and are satisfied with the opportunity for a person to get ahead by working hard.2 Barack Obama frequently referenced our nations essential promise that everybody should have an equal opportunity to succeed. Where you start should not determine where you end up.3Many who believe in that promise will be disappointed. Other nations do a much better job than America in enabling the American Dream for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our levels of economic inequality are far higher than comparable nations, and our levels of mobility across class, race, and ethnicity are lower.4 In The Tyranny of Merit: Whats Become of the Common Good? Michael Sandel gives a masterful account of flaws in the meritocratic ideal and suggestions of what should replace it.5A threshold problem with the meritocratic ideal is the assumption that people deserve their fate. Sandel points out that, just as poor children do not deserve their poverty or the enduring disadvantages that accompany it, well-off children do not deserve their elite credentials or the vast social and economic advantage that accompanies them. Meritocratic hubris reflects the tendency of winners to forget the luck and good fortune that helped them on their way. It is the smug conviction of those who land on top that they deserve their fate, and that those on the bottom deserve theirs, too.6To the extent that innate talents generate success, they are, as Sandel points out, matters of luck, as are the rewards that follow from them.7 For example, LeBron James prospers not only because he is blessed with prodigious athletic gifts, but also because he is fortunate to live in a society that highly rewards them rather than in Renaissance Florence, when fresco painters, not basketball players, were in high demand.8Moreover, innate talent plays far less a role in determining outcomes, and class and race far greater roles, than Americans typically assume. In recent polls, only about a third of Americans said coming from an upper-income family was important in becoming economically successful, and even fewer thought that race or ethnicity was important or that discrimination against people of color contributed a great deal to inequality.9 Yet research summarized in my forthcoming book, Ambition: For What? paints a different picture. Recent studies find that about seventy percent of Americans raised in the bottom two-fifths of the wealth distribution never make it to the middle.10 Those from low-income families have less than a three percent chance of rising to the top fifth of household income distribution as adults.11 White children in poor families are four times more likely to reach affluence than Blacks, and Blacks in affluent families are more likely than whites to end up at the bottom of the economic hierarchy.12Research also shows that innate abilities are not the root of the problem of intergenerational inequality.13 There is no evidence for significant average differences in intelligence-related genes between races, nor are there racial differences in genes linked to any behavioral or cognitive trait.14 Huge income inequalities are largely due to the fact that society has invested far more in developing some peoples talents than others and that it puts very unequal amounts of capital at the disposal of each worker.15That unequal investment begins early. Families with higher income can do more to support their childrens positive development and can live in communities with schools and peers that do the same.16 Parents in the top tenth of the economic hierarchy spend nine times as much on childcare and enrichment as those in the bottom tenth, and differences in expenditures are a strong predictor of cognitive performance.17 Because most American public schools are funded primarily through local taxes, well-off communities can afford more of everything that fosters achievement: smaller classes, higher teacher salaries, and more curricular and extracurricular enrichment.18 Some studies find that the wealthiest ten percent of school districts have ten times the resources as the poorest ten percent, even though poorer schools face much greater educational challenges (e.g. more language barriers, less-adequate student preparation).19The advantages of wealth are equally apparent in the college admission process and, as both my own and Sandels research note, undermine any claims of meritocracy. Well-off parents pay for private schools, tutors, SAT prep courses, athletic expenses, travel and enrichment programs, resume-ready public service experiences, college application advisors, and occasionally even bribes or ghost-written application essays.20 Preferential treatment goes to children of alums, large donors, and, at all but a few colleges, families who can pay full tuition.21 Athletes also get a bump for sports that are generally available only to white, well-off students, such as golf, crew, sailing, and squash.22 All of these factors help explain why two-thirds of students at Ivy League schools come from the top twenty percent of the income scale.23 Yet despite all the factors that compromise claims to merit, a widespread perception remains that, as one employer put it, [n]umber one people go to number one schools.24Such views contribute to an often unacknowledged and unapologetic bias against those without educational credentials. Surveys find that the poorly educated are the most disfavored group in the United States, falling below Blacks, the poor, and the obese.25 Well-educated Americans, who are the most ready to deplore other forms of prejudice, are also the most biased against the uneducated.26 Such unexamined prejudices buttress rationalizations for privilege. Among the winners, Sandel notes, our myths of meritocracy generate hubris; among the losers, humiliation and resentment, all of which contribute to a dysfunctional political polarization.27There are no easy fixes. As an abstract matter, Americans support reforms that would make the American Dream a reality. Ninety percent say our society should do whatever is necessary to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.28 The problem is that they fail to vote that way or even to acknowledge the policy interventions that would be required. As Sandel notes, unless we abolish or radically alter the family and equalize wealth and education, there is no way to truly level the playing field.29 Given the implausibility of those interventions, Sandel wants to give up on the meritocratic ideal, restore the dignity of work, and build a commitment to the common good.30 Colleges could set the right example by using a lottery system to select among qualified applicants instead of perpetuating the myth that their admissions are based solely on merit.31Although I agree with Sandels critique, some of his solutions, such as the lottery, seem unrealistic. My forthcoming book argues that the best hope for a society so committed to meritocratic ideals is to demonstrate cost-effective ways to help realize them and to demonstrate the stake that all Americans have in that effort. Decades of research documents the price that the United States pays for its failure to address escalating inequality and the problems of the least well-off. The consequences include lower economic growth and productivity, lost earnings and tax revenues, less civic engagement, higher crime, greater health care costs, and incalculable human suffering from chronic poverty.32 By many measures, even affluent and middle-income individuals do better in societies that are more equal. They live longer, face less violence, have lower rates of mental illness, and have children more likely to thrive.33 Inadequate concern for other peoples families compromises the future of our own.My book Ambition: For What? reviews the most cost-effective strategies for promoting a more equitable future. They include:reducing child poverty and increasing quality childcare and preschool programs, which lay foundations for later achievement;ensuring more durable investment in underfunded public schools and vocational education;abandoning, or at least reducing, preferences that favor white and wealthy students in college admissions;providing an adequate safety net for the least well-off.34This is not a modest agenda. But surely the recent pandemic has offered daily reminders of all the nonelite workers who are truly essential, and the disastrous consequences of failing to treat them that way. Wherever each of us falls on todays hierarchy of ostensible merit, our futures are interlinked and other peoples problems are problems for us all. We can and must do better in expanding opportunities and rewarding work regardless of the credentials of the worker. The Tyranny of Merit: Whats Become of the Common Good? is a compelling account of progress that remains to be made and the false sense of entitlement that stands in the way.",
    "676": "This paper constructs an overlapping generations general equilibrium model to explore the extent to which heterogeneity in time investment shapes intergenerational mobility of lifetime income. The calibrated model successfully accounts for untargeted distributional aspects of income mobility, which are captured in the income quintile transition matrix. Counterfactual exercises show that removing heterogeneity in parental time investment reduces intergenerational persistence by around 7-8% for early childhood but only marginally in later childhood. Since parental time and monetary investments are poor substitutes for human capital development in early childhood, parental time investment during this period serves as a mechanism that amplifies the transmission of the parents' economic status to their children. Policy experiments find that an asset-tested subsidy for parental monetary investments in early childhood can raise intergenerational mobility in a cost-effective way, though it reduces mobility substantially if given to parents with older school-aged children.",
    "677": "By providing public service for equity and reducing the investment gap between rich and poor children, government spending plays a crucial role in intergenerational income mobility. With the China Health and Nutrition Survey data from 1989 to 2015, this paper assessed the relationship between government spending and intergenerational income mobility in China. First, we found that there was greater intergenerational mobility in high-spending provinces compared with low-spending provinces. Second, children with high per-capita government spending were more likely to experience upward mobility; this effect was twice as common in urban areas compared with rural areas. Third, government spending exerted influence on intergenerational income mobility through the mediation of education expansion. Higher government spending, which brought better quality in primary and secondary education, benefited poorer families more. In underdeveloped provinces, especially rural areas, government spending aimed at equal distribution of public services may provide more opportunities for the poor and lead to greater intergenerational income mobility in the future. Finally, the robustness checks that supported changing how income was measured or how government spending occurred did nothing to change our findings.",

    "679": "In recent decades the international migration has increased worldwide. The influx of people from different cultures and ethnic groups poses new challenges to the labor market and the welfare state of the host countries and causes changes in the social fabric. In general, immigration benefits the economy of the host country. However, these gains from immigration are unevenly distributed among the native population. Natives who are in direct competition with the new workers expect wage losses and a higher probability of getting unemployed, whereas remaining natives foresee either no feedback effects or even wage gains. On the other hand, the tax and transfer system benefits disproportionally from an influx of highly skilled immigrants. Examinations of 20 European countries in 2010 show that a higher proportion of low-skilled immigrants in the immediate neighborhood of the natives increases the difference in the demand for redistribution between high-skilled and low-skilled natives. Thus, high-skilled natives are more opposed to an expansion of the governmental redistribution. On the one hand, a higher proportion of low-skilled immigrants generates a higher fiscal burden on the welfare state. On the other hand, high-skilled natives' wages increase due to an influx of low-skilled immigrants, since relative supply of high-skilled labor increases. In addition to the economic impact of immigration, the inflow of new citizens is accompanied by natives' fear of changes in the social environment as well as in symbolic values, such as cultural identity or natives' set of values. The latter might generate negative attitudes towards immigrants and increase the demand for a more restrictive immigration policy. On the other hand, more interethnic contact due to a higher ethnic diversity could reduce natives' information gaps, prejudices and stereotypes. This, in turn, could enhance more tolerance and solidarity towards immigrants among natives. Examinations of 18 European countries in 2014 show that more interethnic contact during everyday life reduces both the natives' social distance from immigrants and their fear of social upheaval by the presence of immigrants. However, natives' social distance from immigrants has no effect on their preference for redistribution, but their perceived threat to the national culture and social life by the presence of immigrants has a significantly negative impact on their demand for redistribution. Thus, natives concern about the preservation of symbolic norms and values affects the solidarity channel of their redistribution preference. An individual's upward mobility over time or in relation to his or her parents determines his or her attitude towards the welfare state as well as the transfer of his or her opinions to his or her own children. With regard to intergenerational income mobility, Germany shows a value in the international midfield; higher than the United States (lower mobility) and lower than the Scandinavian countries (higher mobility) For example, if a father's lifetime income increases by 10 percent, his son's lifetime income increases by 4.9 percent in the United States and by 3.1 percent in Germany. Additionally, in Germany, fathers' lifetime income tends to show a higher impact on their sons' income if their incomes are higher. In the United States, fathers' lifetime incomes have a stronger influence on their sons' income at the lower and the upper end of the income distribution compared to the middle. Taking a closer look at the intragenerational wage mobility and wage inequality in Germany, the development at the current edge is rather sobering. Since 2000 there is a steady decline in wage mobility. Furthermore, wage mobility in the services sector has been significantly lower than in the manufacturing sector since the beginning of the 2000s. This result is mainly driven by the decrease of wage mobility in the health care and social services sector. Moreover, a worker's unemployment spells and occupation have become more important in the meantime. Since 2006 the increase in the German wage inequality has markedly slowed down and wage growth between 2006 and 2013 has been even polarized, i.e. wages at the lower and at the upper end of the wage distribution have increased more than wages in the middle. However, this development can be partly attributed to the computerization and automation of the production processes. Although, there was substitution of manual routine tasks between 2001 and 2013, cognitive routine tasks are still more pronounced in the middle and at the upper end of the wage distribution. Furthermore, the latter experienced an increase in wage mobility since 2000. On the other hand, manual non-routine tasks are localized disproportionally in the middle and at the lower end of the wage distribution. Thus, the wage gains of these occupations at the lower end were compensated for by the wage losses in the middle.",
    "680": "Using 1995 and 2005 Survey of Social Stratification and Mobility (SSM) this paper analyzes the effect of being regularly employed on intergenerational income mobility (IGM) from fathers to sons in Japan. Using Two Sample Two Stage Least Square (TS2SLS) method by which fathers income is imputed by their characteristics since it is unobservable, intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) between fathers and sons who are employees is estimated, and IGE is decomposed following a well-established framework. Focusing on sons born from 1935 to 1976, this paper finds that IGE increased from 1995 to 2005. The contribution rate of whether being regular employees in current job or not to IGE increased from less than 2% in 1995 to over 9% in 2005, and the increasing in IGE explained by regular employment status accounts for around 30% of increasing in IGE between father and sons who are employees from 1995 to 2005. The dominating reason for this pattern is that it had become difficult for sons from less prosperous families to find regular positions after the collapse of traditional employment structure since late 1990s. This study indicates that how are people employed had impeded equality of opportunities for youth and had exacerbated intergenerational transmission of income inequality in Japan.",

This sharp increase with age is stronger than for other countries, is not explained by sample selection bias and is not specific to particular types of wealth.

    "683": "Numerous studies have found that income inequality reduces the chances of upward relative mobility (i.e. climbing up the income ladder) However, most of this work ignores the role played by institutional quality (namely, economic freedom) in determining mobility and increasing the individuals set of choices. We fill this gap by empirically testing the direct and indirect (through economic growth) impacts of economic freedom on intergenerational income mobility. We find that economic freedom has both direct and indirect effects on intergenerational income mobility. Income inequality is also a strong predictor, but of downward income mobility. When we incorporate findings about the purely mechanical relationship between inequality and intergeneration income mobility (e.g. Guner 2015; Berman 2019) we find that the legal system and property rights component of economic freedom matters more than inequality. These results suggest that good institutions can increase intergenerational income mobility.",

We suggest this mirrors the unusually high income concentration at the top of the Chilean income distribution.",
    "685": "Based on responses in the General Social Survey, we construct an index that captures non-monetary qualities of occupations, such as respect, learning, and work hazards, relevant to the well-being of workers. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, we document that the children of richer US parents are more likely to select into occupations that rank higher in terms of this index. We rationalize this fact by introducing occupational choice with preferences over the intrinsic qualities of occupations into a standard theory of intergenerational mobility. Estimating the model allows us to infer the equivalent monetary compensation each worker receives from the intrinsic qualities of their chosen occupation. Earnings adjusted to reflect this additional compensation show substantially larger persistence of income from parents to children. Our model further predicts that the trends in the composition of labor demand in the US over the past three decades decreased intergenerational persistence, and also led to higher growth in the welfare of the average worker than that implied by observed earnings.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",
    "686": "Elite college attendance significantly impacts students' entrepreneurship decisions and career dynamics. We find that an elite college degree is positively correlated with entrepreneurship (i.e. owning an incorporated business) but not with other selfemployment forms. Our overlapping generations model captures selfselection in education and career choices based on heterogeneous ability and family wealth endowments over the life cycle. Our estimates show that (1) entrepreneurs and other selfemployed individuals require different types of human capital, and (2) elite colleges generate considerably more human capital gain than ordinary colleges, particularly for entrepreneurs. Distinguishing between elite and ordinary colleges improves our prediction of entrepreneurship decisions. Providing subsidies for elite colleges is more efficient than subsidizing their ordinary counterparts to encourage entrepreneurship, enhance intergenerational mobility, and enhance welfare. In contrast, although startup subsidy increases entrepreneurship, it does not improve their performance, and it is inferior to education subsidy in generating efficiency, equality, and intergenerational mobility.",

    "688": "This paper analyzes the roles of innate talent versus family background in shaping intergenerational mobility and social welfare under different education systems. We establish an overlapping-generations model in which the allocation of workforce between a high-paying skilled labor sector and a low-paying unskilled labor sector depends on talent, parental human capital, and educational resources, and the wage rate of skilled workers is governed by their average talent. Our model suggests that under the private education system, income inequality is inversely associated with social mobility, and the steady-state average talent of skilled labor declines as parents increase educational spending. The introduction of public education, which makes the allocation of workforce depend more on talent and less on family background, tends to increase both inequality and mobility and improve welfare under reasonable conditions. Our simulations show that if the government diverts public school funding to redistribution, the economy has lower inequality and mobility in the steady state. Moving from elitist to meritocratic systems yields lower inequality and greater mobility.",

We find that an increase of 1 percentile in parent income rank is associated with on average 0.2 percentile increase in child income rank for both natives and second-generation immigrants. Results from a detailed Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition indicate that up to 21% of the gap between income ranks of second-generation immigrants and natives is related to differences in parental background. Once we control for education, family, residence and industry related choices, differences in the parental income rank account for around 8% of the overall gap. The results indicate that although the intergenerational income mobility is relatively high in Estonia both for natives and children of foreign-born, the native-immigrant earnings gap has not decreased for the second generation.",
    "690": "I evaluate Andrade and Thomsen (A&T)'s (2018) study, which concludes that Denmark is significantly more educationally mobile than the United States. I make three observations. First, A&T overstate the difference in educational mobility between Denmark and the United States. Both in international comparison and compared with differences in intergenerational income mobility, A&T's reported country differences in educational mobility are negligible. For example, whereas income mobility estimates reported in the literature differ by 300 to 600 percent between the two countries, the corresponding educational mobility estimates that A&T report differ by 10 to 20 percent. Second, I provide evidence suggesting that A&T's use of crude categorical education measures leads them to overstate these negligible differences. Third, A&T's empirical analyses of the U.S. data contain several statistical and data-related flaws, some so severe that they potentially undermine the credibility of their analyses. In sum, A&T's results are perfectly consistent with the existence of a mobility paradox very similar to what SwedenUnited States comparisons show: although Denmark and the United States are dissimilar with respect to income mobility, they are similar with respect to educational mobility.

We identify four mobility groups by cross-classifying parental education (degree/no degree) by their offspring (degree/no degree) and study the long-term economic consequences of intergenerational educational mobility. Data for this study come from Swedish population registers covering birth cohorts between 1953 and 1955. We analyse earnings trajectories of Swedish men and women, in each educational mobility category, over most of their working-age life course. We find that the earnings trajectories cluster in two groups that reflect eachs educational destination, not their educational origin. These results suggest that mobility trajectories in the Swedish labour market do not follow any strong advantage pattern but instead are explained by the attainment of human capital. By contrast, complementary analyses of mid-life wealth, not necessarily derived in the labour market, suggest more support for cumulative advantage since those with high-educated parents have much higher levels of wealth. We argue that these contrasting results, between earnings and wealth, highlight the Swedish welfare regimes effectiveness, particularly in regulating and suppressing inequality in the labour market.",

We show that child's educational attainment is more important than parents' income or other family characteristics for predicting child's income and it is still being the second most important variable after conditional on these characteristics. We also show that educational attainment can reduce the impacts of parents' income on child's income and has more impacts on income for non-white children. The findings imply that working hard to earn higher educational attainment can be more important than being born in a rich and white family (i.e. kind of destiny)",

We tackle both questions empirically using detailed intergenerational data from Norway, focusing on effects on wages rather than capital income. Results suggest that a net wealth of NOK 1 million increases wages of the children by NOK 14,000. Children of wealthy parents also have a higher labor income mobility. The estimated hypothetical wage distribution without the wealth tax is more unequal. Moreover, suggestive evidence indicates parental wealth is associated with higher labor risk taking.",
    "694": "Theoretical and empirical studies exploring the eects of income in- equality upon growth reach a disappointing inconclusive result. Some recent empirical papers have emphasized that one reason for this ambi- guity could be that income inequality is actually a composite measure of inequality of opportunity (IO) and inequality of eort (IE) These types of inequality would aect growth through opposite channels, so the relationship between inequality and growth would depend on which component is larger. Based on this preliminary empirical result, we build an intergenerational model with human capital of inequality and development. The existence of a trap in the process of human capi- tal accumulation generates multiplicity of equilibria and permits the inclusion of social mobility in the analysis. The model is able to explain how IO and IE aect human capi- tal accumulation and hence ongoing long-run growth. The existence of social mobility in society makes the relationship between income in- equality and growth to be non-linear, and the Onal sign of the inauence of inequality on growth to be dependent on the degree of development and overall inequality of the economy. We Ond that IE is generally beneOcial to human capital accumulation and, therefore, to ongoing growth, while IO positively aects human capital (income) only for less developed economies",

Using a linear estimator of income share mobility, we find that the four countries have very similar rates of intergenerational mobility. However, when we use nonparametric versions of rank and income share mobility, we find that the US tends to experience lower upward mobility at the bottom of the income distribution than Norway and Sweden.",

Two aspects of the problem are examined: the extent of parental support, and when the funds are allocated, i.e. from earlier saving, from current income or in the form of loans to be repaid in the future. Data are drawn from the 1987 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, which included surveys of both aided and unaided students, college record offices, and a survey of a smaller sample of parents.

    "697": "A person born into a deprived family is unable to obtain a proper education due to poverty, and consequently cannot find a good job and so earns a low income. This is how poverty is transmitted. In contemporary Japan, where growing disparities in society are generating significant interest in the mass media, this is exactly the kind of statement that the media tends to seize upon. However, a variety of difficulties hinder any empirical analysis of such an intergenerational transmission of poverty. Firstly, as we shall see later, it is almost impossible to measure the income of the individuals family of origin. And secondly, an excessive focus on the intergenerational transmission of poverty means that intergenerational transmission in other classes may end up being overlooked. Unless an accurate picture of intergenerational mobility in all income classes in Japan can be obtained, the transmission of poverty cannot be properly understood. With these difficulties in mind, therefore, our approach in this paper is as follows. Firstly, we present a method of estimating fathers income to serve as the income of the individuals family of origin, and then proceed to estimate income by this method using actual data. Secondly, intergenerational mobility between estimated fathers income class and individuals income class is analyzed to determine whether or not intergenerational transmission of poverty occurs. Finally, the mechanism that gives rise to intergenerational income (im)",

In addition to documenting the trend and patterns over time and across groups and regions, seven sources of income inequality are systematically discussed with an effort to reconcile and extend the existing literature. Furthermore, a negative correlation is documented between income inequality and intergenerational mobility, consistent with the Great Gatsby curve observed in developed countries.

We find that mother aspirations are strongly related to the child's grade achieved at age 18. The relation is nonlinear, suggesting there is a threshold, and depends on caste, household income and the village setting. The coefficients remain large and significant when applying control function estimation, using first born son as instrument. A similar strong relation is observed with learning outcomes, including local language, English and maths test results, and with attending school, but not with attending private education. These results are confirmed for outcomes at age 15. The findings provide direct evidence on the contribution of mother aspirations to children's education outcomes and point to aspirations as a channel of intergenerational mobility. They suggest that education outcomes can be improved more rapidly by taking aspirations into account when targeting education programmes, and through interventions that shape aspirations.",

We use proxy variables (the economic situation of the household during the adolescence of the informant and the educational level achieved by parents) to study intergenerational income mobility, because there are not extant surveys with income information from parents and their descendants when they are part of a different household. With these variables, we try to verify the existence and degree of mobility by analysing different methodologies.

We do not find wealth mobility to be higher between periods of a person's life than between generations. We find that the process of household division plays an important role: sons who splinter off from the father's household experience greater (albeit downward) mobility in wealth. Despite significant occupational mobility across generations, its contribution to wealth mobility, net of human capital attainment of individuals, appears insignificant. Low wealth mobility in our data is primarily explained by intergenerational persistence in educational attainment.",
    "706": "Education has been proved to be one of the most important variables influencing intergenerational income mobility. Existing literature decomposes the indirect effect of education on intergenerational income mobility into two components: the effect of the correlation between a parents income and their childrens education, and the effect of the return to education. Basing on the framework of existed studies, this paper explores a beneficial application to measure the two components, and checks which effect is more important in explaining the intergenerational income mobility in Chinese society. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) the research analyzes how education affects intergenerational income mobility, and estimates the respective contributions of the two effects of education. The empirical results show that the effect of education is of importance in explaining the increase in the intergenerational income correlation for 1960s, 1970s and 1980s of Chinese age groups. Meanwhile, after decomposing the effect of education, we find that the return on education has stronger explanatory power on intergenerational income mobility than the correlation between a fathers income and his childs education. Therefore, the return to education should be the center of policy design for the Chinese government.",
    "707": "We present new evidence on the existence and drivers of trends in intergenerational income mobility using administrative income data from Scandinavia along with survey data from the United States. Harmonizing the data from Sweden, Denmark and Norway, we first find that intergenerational rank associations in income have increased uniformly across Scandinavia for cohorts of children born between 1951 and 1979. These trends are robust to a large set of empirical specifications that are common in the associated literature. However, splitting the trends by gender, we find that father-son mobility has been stable in all three countries, while correlations involving females display substantial trends. Similar patterns are confirmed in the US data, albeit with slightly different timing. Utilizing information about individual occupation, education and income in the Scandinavian data, we find that intergenerational mobility in latent economic status has remained relatively constant for all gender combinations. This suggests that a gradual reduction in gender-specific labor market segregation, increased female labor force participation and increased female access to higher education has strengthened the signal value that maternal income carries about productivity passed on to children. Based on these results, we argue that the observed decline in intergenerational mobility in Scandinavia is consistent with a socially desirable development where female skills are increasingly valued at the labor market, and that the same is likely to be true also in the US.",

Theoretical models imply nonlinear relationships between parent and child status that are often ignored in practice and offer potentially different interpretations of the evidence of heterogeneity in mobility across locations, groups, and time.

Yet, it is not well-understood how the experience of intergenerational income mobility between origin and destination SEP, per se, affects health outcomes. We use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health collected in the United States with the outcome measure of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) constructed from data on LDL Cholesterol, Glucose MG/DL, C-reactive protein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and resting heart rate. Intergenerational income mobility is estimated as the difference between Waves 1 and 5 income quintiles. Diagonal reference models are used to test if intergenerational income mobility, net of origin and destination income quintile effects, is associated with CMR. We find that individuals in the lowest and the highest income quintiles have, respectively, the highest and the lowest CMR; both origin and destination income quintiles are equally important; there are no significant overall income mobility effects for different gender and race/ethnicity groups, but downward income mobility has negative health implications for individuals with poor initial health. We conclude that downward income mobility can increase inequalities in CMR in the United States by worsening the health of those who had poor health before their mobility experiences.",

The rich take advantage of this through educational investments in their children, and mobility decreases as a consequence of an increase in the ability to reward talent.

Nevertheless the US has a relatively low degree of intergenerational mobility precisely because meritocracy facilitates a high correlation of ability with background.",
    "711": "Upward intergenerational mobility, defined as the improvement of one generations outcomes over those of their parents, is not only the foundation of the American Dream, but also a primary means of closing longstanding gaps in life opportunities on the basis of race. For decades, the concept of upward mobility has primarily attended to childrens occupational or income attainments relative to their parents. More recently the concept of mobility has been expanded to include other key dimensions of well-being, such as educational attainment and physical and mental health.1 Because of structural economic changes that prioritize skill-based labor, a postsecondary credential or college degree are now virtual prerequisites for attaining significant upward economic mobility.2Moreover, excellent health in young adulthood is not only a potential outcome of educational and income mobility, it also shapes the trajectory of income mobility in middle age because of its influence on employment, hours worked, and health care costs.3 This indicates that income, education, and health should be thought of as 3 components in a multidimensional concept of intergenerational mobility, providing a more robust representation of changes in opportunity over the life course than any one dimension alone.Mobility in all 3 of these dimensions can be thought of as striving and thriving, with striving characterizing educational and income mobility and thriving in this context referring to mobility in mental and physical health. Black, American Indian, and to a lesser extent Latinx Americans exhibit clear gaps in striving and thriving relative to White Americans that portend continuing opportunity gaps well into the future. For Black individuals, long-term longitudinal studies show that gaps in intergenerational mobility in striving and thriving have proved stubbornly persistent with large Black-White gaps in both upward and downward mobility across generations.48Pioneering work by Chetty and others58 has demonstrated that when looking at income mobility, Black people have much lower probabilities of rising out of poverty across generations compared to White people. In fact, a recent study found that 1 in 5 Black people (21.3%) are mired in poverty across 3 generations compared to just 1.2% of White people.9 Black and American Indian individuals are also much less likely to reach the middle of the income distribution. Figure 1 shows the percentage of children born in the late 1970s and early 1980s that reached the median of the household income distribution in 2015.10 The vast majority of Black and American Indian children (83% and 78%) will not reach the middle, compared to roughly half of White (49%) and Asian (48%) and two-thirds of Latinx (67%) children.Lastly, for Black individuals that do make it to the middle class in one generation, their children are much more likely to fall out of it in the next generation compared to White people. On average, more than one-half of Black individuals have been downwardly mobile (56%) from the middle class (third quintile of the income distribution) since the Baby Boomer generation, compared to roughly one-third (34%) of White individuals.6,8 A similar proportion of American Indian people (53%) are downwardly mobile from the middle class as are 41% of Latinx people.Educational mobility shows somewhat different patterns. For much of the 20th century, Black females educational mobility rates exceeded those of White females, and Black males roughly maintained similar rates as White males.11 However, much of this advantage or parity has occurred at the high-school level as Black students closed large gaps in rates of high school graduation with White students from around 70 percentage points in 1930 to roughly 5 percentage points in 2018.12 Gaps in college graduation, on the other hand, have actually increased since the 1970s.12 Perhaps helping to explain rising gaps in college attainment are the high rates of downward educational mobility from college attainment across generations. Looking at children born in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Fig 2, three-quarters of American Indian males (76%) nearly 70% of Black males, and 61% of Latino males who are the children of college graduates failed to graduate from college. This compares to 44% and 37% of White and Asian males, respectively. Roughly one-half (49%) of Black and Latina females experienced this type of downward educational mobility, compared to 31% for White females and 25% for Asian females. Startlingly, 67% of American Indian females will experience downward education mobility.13When it comes to health, Black and Latinx individuals experience substantially lower upward and higher downward mobility than White individuals. One landmark study by Halliday et al14 examines health mobility using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Using rank mobility estimates, they find that Black people experience both lower upward mobility and higher downward mobility in self-rated health when compared to White people, although the gaps are not as large as they are for income. White individuals with parents at the 25th health percentile are expected to reach the 47th percentile in the health distribution as adults, compared to Black individuals who are expected to reach just the 37th percentile. This 10-percentile gap gets even larger as we move up the health distribution. With parents at the 75th health percentile, Black people can expect a health percentile rank that is 15 percentiles lower than White people in adulthood. A similar study using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) includes a sufficiently large sample of Latinx individuals to provide comparisons to Black and White individuals.15 They find that children whose parents have poor health (at the 25th percentile of the parent health distribution) have similarly poor likelihoods of upward health mobility across racial groups. However, Black and Latinx children born to parents in relatively good health (at the 75th percentile) are more likely to fall to the 50th percentile of the health distribution in adulthood relative to non-Hispanic White children.A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that upward education and income mobility may generate no benefits or even a deterioration in health.16 In other words, rather than helping to close racial gaps in health mobility, striving may in fact undermine thriving. Although there is a consensus that higher education is now essential to upward income mobility, the evidence linking upward income and educational mobility to improved health points to a much more complicated story. Two growing bodies of research, known as diminished health returns and skin deep resilience, suggest that striving (ie, education and income mobility) appears for people of color and those raised in low-income families to be of limited help in promoting thriving (ie, health mobility) and may even involve a tradeoff where economic and educational success yield good mental health but reduced physical health.16The research findings presented above suggest that it is not safe to assume that increased educational and income mobility will necessarily improve the physical well-being of poor, Black, American Indian, and Latinx children over the life course. At a minimum, there needs to be a greater awareness of the potential striving-thriving trade-off. For interventions that aim to promote improvements in educational attainment, employment, or income across the life course, the inclusion of health assessments during follow-up periods to help determine whether health outcomes are moving in the same direction as educational and income gains across racial or class subgroups is a needed addition to research design. There also needs to be much greater attention paid to childrens early health development as well as the stressors that occur during adolescence and young adulthood during the striving journey. Understanding more about whether these observed relationships are causal and the mechanisms underlying them may help to design interventions that can keep health trajectories on track while children pursue educational and income attainments. These interventions will need to take a life course perspective, aimed at optimizing the development of health early in life through young adulthood1720 so as to build up health reserves and resilience to buffer against later challenges. These interventions will also need to account for structural issues, such as neighborhood context, racism, and classism, that may contribute to the countervailing relationship between striving and thriving. Greater understanding of the complex ecosystem that children from lower income families and families of color find themselves traversing on the path to economic mobility could suggest new types of multilevel interventions that are more responsive to their needs, resulting in an equity from the start approach that improves all aspects of the life path, reducing or even eliminating later health disparities.",
    "712": "How do poor entrepreneurs trade off investments in business enterprises versus children's human capital, and how do these choices influence intergenerational socio-economic mobility? To examine this, we exploit experimental variation in household income resulting from a one-time relaxation of household liquidity constraints (Field et al. 2013) and track schooling and business outcomes over the subsequent 11 years. On average, treatment households, who were made wealthier through the experiment, increase human capital investment such that their children are 35% more likely to attend college. However, schooling gains only accrue to children with literate parents, among whom college attendance nearly doubles. In contrast, treatment effects on investment among the illiterate accrue only on the business margin and are accompanied by adverse educational outcomes for children. As a result, treatment lowers relative educational mobility. In a forecasting exercise, we find that earnings gains for literate households are four times larger than the earnings gains for illiterate households, raising earnings inequality. Our findings highlight how parental investment choices can contribute to a growth in intergenerational earnings inequality despite reductions in urban poverty.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

To evaluate the quantitative importance of fertility and family transfers, we extend the standard heterogeneous agent life-cycle model with idiosyncratic income shocks and incomplete markets to allow for endogenous fertility, family transfers, and education. Initial conditions are defined as the agents' initial state variables, which are endogenously related to parental background.

It is shown that experiencing higher income inequality in childhood is associated with lower intergenerational mobility measured in adulthood.

    "715": "The intergenerational transmission of employers between fathers and sons is a common feature of labour markets in Canada and Denmark, with 30 to 40% of young adults having at some point been employed with a firm that also employed their fathers. This is strongly associated with the first jobs obtained during the teen years, but for four to about six percent it also refers to the main job in adulthood. In both countries the transmission of employers is positively associated with paternal earnings, rising distinctly and sharply at the very top of the father's earnings distribution, and has implications for the intergenerational transmission of earnings. Mobility out of the bottom has little to do with inheriting an employer from the father, while the preservation of high income status is distinctly related to this tendency. These findings stress that child adult outcomes are related to the structure of labour markets, and underscore the role of resources parents have though information, networks, or direct control of the hiring process in facilitating the job search of their children.",
    "716": "Lower intergenerational income mobility for blacks is a likely cause behind the persistent inter-racial gap in economic status in the US. However, few studies have analyzed black-white differences in intergenerational income mobility and the factors that determine these differences. This is largely due to the absence of appropriate methodological tools. We develop nonparametric methods to estimate the effects of covariates on two measures of mobility. We first consider the traditional transition probability of movement across income quantiles. We then introduce a new measure of upward mobility which is the probability that an adult child's relative position exceeds that of the parents. Conducting statistical inference on these mobility measures and the effects of covariates on them requires nontrivial modifications of standard nonparametric regression theory since the dependent variables are nonsmooth functions of marginal quantiles or relative ranks. Using NLSY data, we document that blacks experience much less upward mobility across generations than whites. Applying our new methodological tools, we find that most of this gap can be accounted for by differences in cognitive skills during adolescence.",

Moreover, SC / STs have matched non-SC / STs in occupation mobility rates. We conclude that the last 20 years of structural changes in India have coincided with a breaking down of caste-based barriers to socioeconomic mobility.",
    "718": "This paper examines mobility of income and occupational status for men and women using the GSS and the NLS surveys. The intergenerational reproduction of occupational status is stronger for men than women; it is largely mediated by educational attainment, and appears not to have changed over time. The intergenerational income association is much stronger than occupational status, equally strong across genders, and education plays a weaker mediating role. This suggests that mechanisms other than educational and occupational resources play an important role in intergenerational reproduction of advantage. The intergenerational reproduction declines among college graduates but reemerges among advanced degree holders, questioning the meritocratic character of labor markets for skilled workers. Quantile regression analysis of income mobility suggest a fanning in pattern of intergenerational association with stronger persistence at the top than at the bottom -- children of wealthy parents are more homogeneously wealthy than children of poor parents are homogeneously poor.",
    "719": "AbstractWe argue that stability and increasing fluidity coexist in the contemporary Japanese social stratification system. It is often argued that the weakening of Japanese employment practices has made the labor market more flexible. While there is evidence to support this argument, it misses an important factor in the labor market, namely social stratification. We suggest that some parts of the labor market have become more fluid, while other parts have been stable. To test this prediction, we examine empirical findings made in the 2005 Social Stratification and Social Mobility Survey Project, covering such topics as education and inequality, increasing fluidity and disparity among young workers, job changes, and income inequality. Our findings on education and inequality show that stratification in the educational system affects the entry of graduates into regular or non-regular employment. Our analysis of young workers shows that while the longterm employment practice persists in large firms and the public sector and thus shows stability, mobility between regular and non-regular employment is difficult and that young female graduates from high schools and junior colleges recently find it difficult to enter the regular employment sector. Our analysis of the effect of education on job changes shows that the income of less educated workers who change jobs has decreased recently. We also find increasing income inequality between professionals and other occupations and examine the intergenerational transmission of income. We conclude that these findings generally support our prediction that stability and increasing fluidity coexist in the contemporary Japanese labor market. We consider the implications of this for the study of social stratification in Japan.Keywords: social stratificationfluiditystability Notes* This paper is based on I thank the Japan Sociological Society for their permission to publish an English version of it.

The phenomenon of social sorting and its role in human capital transmission is one that every parent and homeowner has direct experience with. On the other hand, the economic research tying it to larger issues of national inequality, intergenerational mobility, and even aggregate performance may not be immediately familiar to a broad macro audience. For this reason, and to bring out some deeper connections between different types of inequality-mobility mechanisms, I will start with a bit of background.As the authors explain, between the early 1990s and the early twenty-first century there was a substantial amount of theoretical work on the dynamics of income and wealth inequality, social mobility, and in particular, on their relationships to socioeconomic stratification, which is the topic of this paper. This research, itself following on the pioneering work of Loury (1977, 1981) drew on a few important empirical studies, but the data available at the time was mostly cross-sectional and small-sample. The major trends inspiring it, however, were readily apparent from casual observation: simultaneous increases in income inequality and in the degree of residential segregation by incomebest epitomized by the rise of gated communitiesas well as a host of contentious cases before state supreme courts over wide disparities in school funding.This mostly theoretical literature led to a general lesson and several specific predictions. The former was part of an even broader message emerging at the timesadly, the representative agent had died: from growth takeoffs and failures in emerging countries to stagnation and business cycles in industrialized ones, macro outcomes depend on agent heterogeneity and distributional dynamics through a host of channels, both economic and political. Among them, and of primary interest here, is the manner in which a heterogeneous population sorts itself into distinct communities, neighborhoods, and firms, where human capital is accumulated, shared, and used to produce. As to the specific predictions arising consistently from models of this type (e.g. Bnabou 1993, 1996; Durlauf 1996; Fernandez and Rogerson 1996) there were three main ones:1. More socioeconomically stratified places will tend to have lower social mobility.2. More unequal places will tend to be, or become, more socioeconomically segregated.3. Consequently, greater inequality will be associated with lower mobility.The last implication, in particular, sharply contrasts with the benign neglect view, prevalent in much of earlier economics, that social mobility tends to offset cross-sectional inequality, thereby alleviating the need for redistribution. and Vice VersaThis was before the age of Big Dataand Big Mediaso these effects did not yet have fancy names like Great Gatsby Curve, or get written up and debated by pundits. They were well understood, nonetheless, as were some closely related mechanisms (described below) that also generate a negative relationship between inequality and mobility.Nowadays, we have massive data sets and amazingly detailed studies (e.g. Chetty et al. 2014) which turn out to strikingly validate the three key predictions. At the same time, relatively little effort is devoted to investigate the exact mechanisms underlying these facts, linking them back to the earlier theories or to newer ones. Thus, after lagging behind theory for some time, measurement has now moved substantially ahead, and a renewed effort at closing the gap is well overdue. This is the endeavor that I see this paper as undertaking, in a manner that is both ambitious in its goals and very open in its assessment of the somewhat mixed nature of the results emerging so far.I will organize the rest of my discussion in four main parts. First, I will outline some general principles about the types of models that can or cannot account for the major patterns seen in the (national or cross-country) data about what I consider to be an inseparable trinity: inequality, redistribution (whether explicit or implicit) and social mobility. This broader scope will then provide a unified view of a whole class of mechanisms that readily generate a so-called Gatsby Curve, including, of course, the one emphasized in the Durlauf-Sheshadri paper. Next, I will represent these ideas with a simple model and explain how it maps to a reduced form similar to that in the paper. Finally, I will focus on the novel empirical analysis provided by the authorsraising some questions, venturing a few suggestions, and connecting with some other recent evidence.The Unholy Trinity: Inequality, Redistribution/Mixing, and MobilityFor expositional purposes, I will contrast two main (necessarily simplified) views of this critical politico-social-economic nexus, which I will respectively label classical (in the tradition of Becker and Tomess [1979] seminal work) and new (that is, post-1990s).The most basic case of the traditional view is one in which: (a) pretax inequality is either exogenous (reflecting pure talent, preferences, etc.) or resulting from a smooth process of human and/or physical capital accumulation, occurring under complete asset markets and free of any externalities; (b) consequently, the resulting distributional dynamics are independent of initial conditions, and, in particular, of the initial allocation of individual resources. Conversely, any redistributive policywhether through taxes and transfers, the education system and its financing, interference in the composition of neighborhoods and communities, and so forthis only a source of deadweight losses; (d) on the political side, as inequality rises the median (or pivotal) voter becomes poorer and imposes more redistribution, in spite of these costs. This reduces post-tax inequality, but has no effect on pretax inequality nor on social mobility, which are largely exogenous.An amended, more realistic version of this classical view replaces assumption (a) with a recognition that human capital investment, particularly early on in life, is often subject to wealth constraints arising from imperfect markets for credit and insurance. This implies that redistribution and other progressive policies, such as equalizing educational budgets and resources, now dampen the transmission of wealth and income differences, thus increasing social mobility; they can also have potentially positive effects on efficiency and growth. As long as the traditional political-economy view embodied in (d) is maintained, however, two key implications follow. First, the policy response to inequality shocks (international trade, skill-biased technical progress, etc.) is stabilizing. Second, and now directly related to our main concern, greater inequality is associated with higher mobility.Clearly, this class of models cannot generate a so-called Gatsby Curve sloping the way we observe in the data (e.g. Corak 2013) They are also counterfactual in another, even more direct way: a number of studies have now established that increased inequality is typically not associated with more redistribution (direct or indirect) but with less. For instance, De show that the share of redistributive transfers in gross domestic product (GDP) during 19811999 is negatively related, for about 55 countries, to their Gini coefficient during 19701980; shows that, in the United States over 18901930, counties with greater land inequality (instrumented by geographical predictors) had lower spending on public education. Of course, contemporary US developments provide perhaps the clearest illustration that assumption (d) goes very much in the wrong direction.In what follows I will therefore outline a number of channels through which rising equality inequality leads (over some range) to less redistribution and equalization of human-capital investment. First among these is the one studied by Durlauf and Sheshadri, namely an exacerbated sorting by income of households across local communities and schools. All of them, however, share the key property of reversing the classical politico-economic mechanism (d) The policy response to inequality shocks will thus now be destabilizing: pretax inequality (e.g. in the next generation) becomes further amplified and greater inequality is now associated with lower mobilityGatsby appears.If the mechanisms involved are strong enough, we even obtain the possibility of multiple steady statesacross countries, states, cities, and so forthwhich, in the cross-section, will display negative relationships between inequality on the one hand, and redistribution (or integration) and social mobility on the other (Bnabou 2000) Thus, in addition to what Durlauf and Sheshadri label a dynamic Gatsby Curve, we get the familiar cross-sectional one as well.Sources of Gatsby Curves: Negative Inequality-Redistribution Mechanisms1. Endogenous Socioeconomic StratificationThis is the channel that Durlauf and Sheshadri emphasize, confronting to modern data some of the key ideas from the literature of the 1990s. There are two key ingredients in the model.First, some essential inputs into human capital accumulation and transmission are neither privately nor centrally provided, but have the nature of local public goods or externalities. These include property-tax-financed primary and secondary education, but also peer effects, local culture and norms (including crime and safety) that differ widely across towns, neighborhoods, and schoolsas amply documented in the paper. I will also note that, whereas local funding of schools is a key feature of the US system, social spillovers and the residential sorting that comes with them remain highly relevant, even in countries with a national education systemprobably now more so than ever.The second key ingredient is that heterogeneous households endogenously sort themselves into communities, school districts, and other clubs, subject to a trade-off between economies of scale, which favor larger, more integrated groups, and the implicit or explicit sharing of human-capital inputs that occurs within each of them, which the better-off classes seek to avoid. As inequality of resources rises due to exogenous shocks, the trade-off shifts toward the second concern, making richer families less willing to pool resources and externalities. Communities and schools thus become more segregated, material and social inputs more unequal, thereby magnifying the persistence of background differences so that intergenerational mobility declines.2. Money (or/and Education) Yields Political InfluenceA second and clearly complementary channel arises from the well-documented fact that wealth, both human and financial, translates into political influence: a persons propensities to turn out at the ballot box, contact their congressman, and, of course, contribute financially to campaigns and causes all rise significantly with their levels of income and education. Moving from inputs to outcomes, research in political science (e.g. Bartels 2008; Gilens 2012) confirms that, across a broad range of domains and time periods, US policy changes are much more responsive to the expressed interests of richer constituents than to those of poorer ones (when the two diverge).On the theory side, shows that, in such a more realistic political system, the relative wealth (and rank in the distribution) of the pivotal voter will rise with inequality, rather than falling as in traditional political-economy models. This means, in turn, that more unequal places and times will be associated with a decline in the extent of redistribution: when incomes start diverging, efficient progressive policies (in education, social or health insurance, urban policy) will increasingly be blocked, and inefficiently regressive ones increasingly promoted. When combined with frictions in human-capital investment, this policy response further amplifies inequality and reduces social mobility.3. Inequality Alters PreferencesThe evidence on this channel is still much more limited and tentative than for the previous two, but it is starting to attract interest. The idea is that greater social distance and reduced social contact between different economic classes (compounded by greater physical distance, through the residential and schooling segregation channel) leads to reduced empathy by the better off for the worse off, and thus a reduced willingness to redistribute. Ct, Housea, and show, using online dictator-game experiments with nationally representative samples, that: (a) controlling for own income, participants from states with greater inequality choose more selfish allocations; (b) when perceptions of inequality in their state are randomly manipulated (by showing them different pie charts for the income distribution) participants who now exogenously believe that they live in a more unequal place again behave less altruistically. This kind of empathic dissociation mechanism is likely to be even more powerful when income differences correlate with ethnic, national origin, and cultural ones.4. Inequality Alters BeliefsA related behavioral channel concerns the beliefs that people hold concerning the extent of social mobility and its determinants. If, consistent with a lot of experimental evidence, some of the rich rationalize (rightly or wrongly) their wealth increases as resulting from meritorious effort, or/and if some of the poor escape from their worsening difficulties by focusing on convenient scapegoats and illusory easy-fix solutions, then just as in the second mechanism above, redistributive pressure and ultimately social mobility will decline as inequality rises.A related case is that of a belief in a just world, maintained through cognitive dissonance to serve both functional and affective needs (Lerner 1982) As shown in where the social safety net and redistribution are limited, agents have strong incentives to uphold, and pass on to their children, beliefs that effort pays, people ultimately get what they deserve and deserve what they get; where such beliefs predominate, in turn, the majority indeed votes for low taxes. With a generous welfare state, just-world beliefs are much less adaptive, so fewer people maintain them, and a majority votes for high taxes and transfers. This leads to the coexistence of: (a) an American Dream equilibrium, with excessively optimistic beliefs about social mobility, high inequality, and little redistribution; (b) a Europessimistic equilibrium, with more realistic or even overly pessimistic beliefs about the return to effort, and high redistribution.1 In a recent study, Alesina, Stantcheva, and compare perceived versus actual income mobility (from the first to other quintiles) across five OECD countries. A key finding is that, on average, Americans are indeed significantly overly optimistic about the degree of social mobility in their country, while Europeans are overly pessimistic.A Simple Unifying (But Slightly Cheating) ModelDurlauf and Sheshadri present a model, based on capturing the endogenous-sorting and dynamic-transmission mechanisms described under channel (1) above. That is hard to do, so the analytical results obtained are inevitably limitedfor example, characterizing only what happens to the poorest dynasty and the richest one in the economy, and this under appropriately selected (there exist ) current income distributions. I will commit here the opposite sin and outline a bare-bones model that conveys the essence of the idea, brings out the unifying logic discussed above, and yields explicit formulas for income distributions, mobility, and the so-called Gatsby Curve. Nothing comes for free, so the central feature of the Durlauf-Sheshadri framework I will have to give up on is the explicit endogeneization of community formation, which I will instead represent in a very reduced-form manner.The model, which is a highly stripped-down version of that in Bnabou (2000, 2006) starts with fairly standard production and accumulation equations:(1)yti=hti,(2)ht+1i=t+1i(hti)(Eti)1(Hti)2,(3)Eit=sYti,leading to(4)ht+1i=s1t+1i(hti)(Hti),where 1+2,In the first two equations, and hti and yit are the human capital and pretax income of generation t of dynasty i, coinciding for simplicity; t+1i is child ability (i.i.d. for simplicity) Eti is education expenditures, hti captures direct in-home learning, and the average human capital in the community Hit represents the influence of peer effects, role models, and other local social spillovers. In the third equation, the constant share of income devoted to educational investment, Eit=sYti will result from Cobb-Douglas parental preferences, absent credit markets. Note, finally, the close similarity between equation (4) and the accumulation equation in the Durlauf-Sheshadri model, labeled (16).Turning now to social-residential structure, and/or education finance policy, I denote by t 0, 1] the economys degree of socioeconomic integration, mapping into a degree of equalization of investment resources across dynasties (explicit or implicit redistribution) Thus, each individual i lives in a community where average human capital is(5)Hti=(hti)1t(Ht)t,where Ht is an economy-wide aggregate (CES index) such that he Hits sum back to the economy-wide average, Ht. A similar relationship naturally holds for incomes, and indeed it is easy to see that the model is quasi-isomorphic to one in which communities are perfectly segregated (Hit=hit) but incomes, or alternatively educational expenditures, are centrally redistributed according to a progressive scheme of the form y^ti=(yti)1t(Yt)t or E^ti=(Eti)1t(Et)t.Taking the ts as exogenous for the moment, and assuming log-normal distributions of shocks and initial endowments, yields simple human capital or income dynamics(6)ln yt+1i=lnt+1i+ln +1ln s+(+(1t))ln yti+tlnYt,from which we readily see that the IGE (IGE)(7)lnyt+1ilnyit=+(1t),is increasing in the degree of social sorting t, and more generally declining in the degree t of implicit or explicit redistribution. The dynamics of inequality (variance of log-incomes t) also readily follow, as does its limit whenever the sequence of t converges to some limit :(8)t+12=(+(1t))2t2+2,(9)2=21(+(1))2D2()Finally, we come to the key question of endogenizing t as a function of the state of the economy at date t. In the classical view described earlier, greater inequality leads to more redistribution, corresponding to an upward-sloping relationship t = T(t); we can now read off from equations (7)(8) how this dampens the transmission of inequality and makes the (dynamic) Gatsby Curve slope the wrong way. This also applies to the long run, for example, cross-sectionally: the two curves = D() and = T() will have a unique intersection, such that an exogenous increase in inequality (2) will result in a higher and consequently a lower IGE.Suppose now, on the contrary, that the social-structure-or-policy locus T(t) slopes up (at least over some range)for instance, if greater inequality at date t leads households to sort even more assortatively across local communities, as occurs endogenously in the Durlauf framework. We then obtain the new view lining up much better with the facts: an increase in t (e.g. from 2) leads to a decline in t, and therefore in social mobility (causal and dynamic Gatsby Curve) thereby amplifying the transmission of inequality. When the downward-sloping = D() and = T() curves intersect more than once, moreover, we obtain multiple stable regimesmetropolitan areas, states, countriesall arranged along a very familiar-looking Gatsby Curve.Empirical Analysis of the Inequality-Segregation-Mobility NexusHaving emphasized the thread that runs through several mechanisms potentially delivering a Gatsby-type curve, as well as the natural complementarities between them, I now focus again on the one studied by Durlauf and Sheshadri, discussing the new evidence they bring to bear on it. As acknowledged by the authors, the challenges involved are many, so not surprisingly the results of the different empirical exercises are mixed. Overall they do suggest a picture consistent with the theory, but more work will be needed to sharpen it.A first remark is that the emphasis in the first and theoretical parts of the paper is on the dynamic Gatsby Curvethat is, how changes in inequality induce changes in social mobility. Yet the empirical analysis of the IGE of child to parental income (IGE) reported in tables 46, appears to use only cross-sectional variations in state or/and census-tract inequality. I thus wonder whether fixed effects could also have been included, or if there is not enough time variation in the relevant series for such estimations to be meaningful? In the latter case, the claims about shifting away from the cross-sectional focus in the preexisting empirical studies should perhaps be tempered somewhat.A second observation is that some of the results vary a fair amount across specificationsboth between tables 4 to 6 and within each of them. When focusing on they key effect of inequality on social mobility (the coefficient on the interaction of parental income with the variance of local incomes) a pattern does emerge that is worth pointing out. Namely, the effect of state-income variance on the IGE (table 5) appears much more stable and robust, in sign and significance, than that of census-tract (about 4,000 people) income variance (table 4) This is consistent with the idea that, at the state level, socioeconomic sorting operates both through unequal school funding across communities and through more localized peer effects, whereas at the census-tract level there is much less flexibility and variation on the school-resources margin, leaving only the peer effects and related local externalities in human capital. In table 6, similarly, when both variances are included, it is that of state incomes that tends to survive.Where I have more trouble interpreting the empirical exercise is going from tables 46 to the inequality-mobility curves plotted in figures 1520. First, we note again an instability: some of these curves slope down, others up, others yet are relatively flat (perhaps they should also have some kind of error band around them) This naturally reflects their being based on estimates from different tables and different columns in each one, given the variations noted above. It would be useful to discuss some more how a specific column was picked in each table (not always the last one) and especially what difference that makes, if any. More puzzling yet is the way in which the pattern noted above for the IGEs estimated dependence on inequality (which I tend to see as the closest counterpart to the theory) appears to be reversed when an overall Gatsby Curve is constructed, from each table, by scaling every familys income by a fixed percentage. Thus, whereas the key coefficient was generally zero in table 4 (census-tract level) and positive in table 5 (state level) in the corresponding figures 16 and 17 the constructed curves respectively slope up and sharply down. This made it a bit difficult for me to understand how these curves map back to the model.Going forward, one possible way of identifying some of the effects involved, and linking the empirical analysis even more closely to the theory, would be to examine the effects of state-income inequality on the mean and variance of public-education spending across communities. As mentioned earlier (Ramacharan 2010) the historical relationship demonstrated regressive effects of (land) inequality, but what is the picture in recent times, both in levels and in changes?Lest readers be left with the impression that the evidence provided in these IGE regression is too tentative (perhaps due to the reflection problem ) let me note first that the paper also provides a calibrated structural model, which the authors use to simulate the effects of increasing (by 20%) the variances of key regressors. The most interesting result, shown in figure 24, is that it is dispersion in parental human capital, more than dispersion in parental income, which has the stronger effect in raising intergenerational persistence. This suggests a greater importance of family and/or local peer effects than of purchased educational inputs. That is certainly plausible, though it would be worth discussing how this fits with the patterns noted above across the regression tables for inequality at different levels.Second, there is concurrent evidence about the central mechanisms emphasized in the paper and the literature on which it draws. Studying the evolution of US Metropolitan Standard Areas (MSAs) document that: (a) between 1970 and 2000, the United States experienced sharp and parallel increases in the average MSA Gini coefficient and segregation index; (b) during 19802000, larger changes in residential income segregation at the MSA level were associated to (significantly) larger changes in MSA income inequality, in line with the theoretical prediction (2) discussed at the start of this comment; (c) the more segregated MSAs display divergence in their trend for income inequality, whereas the less segregated ones display convergence, consistent with prediction (3).Concluding ThoughtsNaturally, much work remains to be done, both on the social-segregation channel and on the other potential (but highly complementary) sources of a negative inequality-mobility relationshipthe so-called Gatsby Curve. This rich paper by Durlauf and Sheshadri is an important and valiant first step in this long overdue reconnection of data with theory.EndnotesFinancial support for the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research is gratefully acknowledged.

    "723": "Editors' Summary Eduardo Engel, Francisco H. G. Ferreira, and Roberto Rigobon Chile's economic performance over the last two decades is one of the few success stories in Latin America during this period. The country's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 4.3 percent a year, and the fraction of the population living under the poverty line decreased from 45.1 to 13.7 percent. The contrast with other countries in the region is stark. For example, Brazil's per capita income, corrected for purchasing power parity (PPP) was 45 percent higher than Chile's in 1985, but it lagged by 30 percent two decades later. These trends have motivated the search for the determinants of the Chilean success story. Early and deep reforms following the prescriptions that eventually became known as the Washington Consensus are one line of explanation. The way in which Chile deviated from this blueprint is another factor. In \"Taxes and Growth in a Financially Underdeveloped Country: Evidence from the Chilean Investment Boom,\" Chang-Tai Hsieh and Jonathan Parker put forward a provocative thesis that goes beyond the standard explanations for Chile's performance. They argue that a reduction of the tax rate on retained profits from 50 to 10 percent in 1984 explains the investment boom underlying the so-called Chilean growth miracle. A central argument of their thesis is that taxation of retained profits is particularly distortionary in an economy with good growth prospects and poorly developed financial marketsas Chile arguably was after liberalizing the economy in the late 1970s and suffering the banking crisis of 1982because it primarily reduces the investment of financially constrained firms. Consistent with this theory, they find a large increase in aggregate investment after the reform, which was entirely funded by an increase in retained profits. Hsieh and Parker's thesis has its caveats, and both discussants do a good job of pointing them out. Yet sometime in the future, when the dust has settled and a synthesis emerges, their thesis is likely to represent a significant part of the explanation for Chile's success story. [End Page vii] Inequality is often cited as a possible explanation for Latin America's lackluster economic performance. Some of the mechanisms through which inequality may hinder growth relate to unequal opportunities and lack of economic mobility. In \"Social Mobility and Preferences for Redistribution in Latin America,\" Alejandro Gaviria uses Latinobarmetro data to explore the relationship between intergenerational mobility and political attitudes in seventeen countries in Latin America. While it has long been known that inequality (say, in educational attainment) is higher in Latin America than in the United States, this paper presents the first multi-country study of differences in educational mobility. The news is not good: in addition to being considerably more unequal, Latin American countries tend to display lower levels of mobility across generations than do developed countries. Does this matter for the outcome of the political process in Latin America? Using Latinobarmetro data on political attitudes, Gaviria finds that demands for redistribution are relatively high in Latin America. Preferences for redistribution are (negatively) correlated with socioeconomic status, more strongly than in other regions, suggesting that the Meltzer-Richards paradigm (that the poorer the median voter, the more redistribution he or she will demand) seems to apply to the region. But one's present position in the distribution is not all that matters: those who are most optimistic about mobility seem to demand less redistribution, as predicted by the hypothesis on prospects for upward mobility. Finally, people's own views of the causes of inequality also matter. Those who feel that poverty is caused by external circumstances, rather than lack of effort, or that hard work does not guarantee success, are more likely to favor an active redistribution policy than those who hold the opposite views. Sadly, a majority of Latin Americans believe that opportunities are not equal for all, that poverty is due to external circumstances, and that hard work is no guarantee of success. This probably reflects their own experiences of limited mobility, and it probably also helps shape their political demands for the role of the.",
    "724": "Most developed countries have family policies, but little is known about their macroeconomic consequences. This paper develops a heterogeneous agent overlapping generations framework that integrates trade-offs between the number of children (quantity) and investment per child (quality) a rich demographic structure, and childcare choices. Calibrating the model to U.S. data and validating it with quasi-experimental evidence, I find that raising aggregate fertility to the replacement level requires a $30,000 cash reward to childbirth, similar to the expansion of the Child Tax Credit in the past decade (in net present value) Contrary to conventional wisdom, such a policy reduces average human capital and intergenerational mobility. The key to this result is that the marginal cost of child quality rises with fertility, and fertility effects of the policy are larger among parents with lower income. Nevertheless, average well-being rises by 1.6% in the long run as the old-age dependency ratio drops, requiring lower taxes to sustain retirement benefits. This gain in long-run welfare comes with higher public spending in transition, which may hurt existing households depending on how the policy is funded. Compared with cash rewards, in-kind benefits are less cost-effective in raising fertility but have other advantages: subsidized childcare encourages parents to work, while expansions of public education improve children's human capital and intergenerational mobility.",

He suggested using an explicit social welfare function to think about this issue from a social-planning perspective. Laura Veldkamp further encouraged the authors to go in the direction of normative analysis. She said that as a New Yorker the findings in the work are particularly salient, noting that rents change significantly at school district boundaries. Inequality considerations have led cities to put in place policies that ensure low-income housing is available in wealthy areas. She gave as example Manhattan, which incentivizes developers to allocate 20% of the units in newly built luxury buildings to low-income housing. Veldkamp asked the author whether the benefit of placing a low-income family in a wealthy location is linear. For example, is it better to mix some very low-income families in very high-income school districts, or is it better to have many more children moving from the first quintile to the middle quintiles locations? Steven Durlauf agreed this is a very important question, but said that his model does not tackle this issue.V. V. Chari noted that in the past 60 years the fraction of spending on education conducted by states has increased dramatically relative to spending conducted by local authorities. He claimed that this force alone suggests intergenerational mobility may have gone up during this period, because this change could potentially decouple the quality of public schools from the wealth of their student populations.Valerie Ramey asked whether there is evidence on intergenerational mobility going further back in time. She said the authors showed both cross-section inequality and intergenerational immobility has gone up since the 1970s, but in her view a better test would also include periods in which cross-sectional inequality had declined. She wondered whether the analysis could be extended to the full postwar period, the beginning of which marked the beginning of a dramatic decrease in inequality that lasted for several decades. Durlauf pointed to the work of who study this period and show less intergenerational mobility for cohorts born between 1957 and 1964 than for cohorts born between 1942 and 1953. Their evidence is in line with the Great Gatsby Curve, as the former entered the market after the large rise in inequality that occurred around 1980.Some participants had questions regarding the measures of inequality and income that the authors use. Gianluca Violante asked whether the shape of the Great Gatsby Curve depends on the measure of inequality used. Durlauf responded that their results are robust to different measures of inequality. Larry Kotlikoff noted that using pretax income does not take into account the large increase in transfers that happened since the 1970s. Durlauf responded that for the purpose of studying the Great Gatsby Curve the pretax income inequality is a good measure. However, he agreed that this measure of income might not be the most suitable for a normative analysis.Greg Mankiw stated that the original Great Gatsby Curve studied intergenerational mobility and cross-sectional inequality across different countries. He wondered whether the literature has considered the geographic scope of the analysis, and whether the cross-country relationship is simply spurious. As an example Mankiw compared Europe as a whole to the United States. Cross-sectional inequality in the Euro area is higher as countries like Germany are persistently richer than countries like Greece, and intergenerational immobility is also higher in Europe as most workers dont leave the country where they were born. These facts alone imply a negative relation between cross-sectional inequality and intergenerational mobility, even if there is no causal relationship. Durlauf agreed that comparing different countries may not be the right comparison as some countries have more homogeneous population than others, giving Norway and the United States as an example.Several participants mentioned related works that study both the cross-sectional inequality and intergenerational mobility. Antoinette Schoar brought up the Moving to Opportunity experiment. She said that while the program has no strong effect on first-generation participants (Katz et al. 2001) there does seem to be a big impact on the second generation (Chetty et al. 2016) She suggested the authors try using the estimates from the Moving to Opportunity experiment in their structural model. Mark Gertler mentioned the paper by Chetty and coauthors (Chetty et al. 2017) on the role of colleges in intergenerational mobility. He finds most interesting their finding that mid-tier public universities tend to have the highest rates of bottom-to-top quintile mobility.Other participants suggested extending the work in several dimensions. Andrew Caplin asked the authors to dig further into the data and channels. He said he would like to understand better the transmission of inequality and beliefs across generations. Martin Eichenbaum wondered whether the findings are robust when controlling for geographic and cultural origins of people in different areas. Relating to Caplins comment, he noted that if some of this relationship is explained by cultural channels it becomes harder to think about policy designed to improve mobility.Jonathan Parker suggested the authors use their structural model to understand how a change in intergenerational mobility affects the cross-sectional inequality. In particular, he asked whether, because an initial shock to inequality propagates over generations, its long-run effect could be much larger than its initial effect if left unchecked. Finally, Chris Carroll wondered whether declining rates of entry and exit across firms in the past few decades (Decker et al. 2014) are related to the increase in cross-sectional inequality. He said the two may be related through a political economy channel, and suggested greater inequality may lead political authorities to reduce the degree of competition in the economy.

    "726": "This study measures the persistence in income and education over three generations in Switzerland. I use administrative data covering the universe of labor income since 1982 and family linkages over three generations. Most studies rely on mobility estimates from two generations to predict the long-term dynamics of inequality. However, recent studies show that extrapolating estimates from two generations to more than two generations underestimate the persistence in inequality. My results show that the traditional two-generation paradigm is well suited to predict persistence in earnings, but strongly underestimates persistence in education. The intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) is around 0.22 between two and 0.05 between three generations. The elasticity for education is 0.31 between two and 0.08 between three generations. I test two theories that could explain this excess persistence: the Clark hypothesis and the direct grandparental effects model. I can reject Clarks hypothesis of a latent persistence as large as 0.75, but cannot reject the direct grandparental effects model.",

An estimationof elasticity of income (and/or any other outcome) of individuals with respect to the income (and/orsome other socioeconomic characteristics) of their previous generations is used to measure thestrength of persistence of inequality over generations. A higher estimated elasticity indicates thatthere is more likelihood of transformation of inequalities from one generation to next generation.Such estimated elasticity is assumed to be lower in those societies which are more egalitarian andprovides equal opportunities of upward socioeconomic mobility to people belonging to differentsocial strata.

    "728": "Both scholarly analyses and main political documents have not focused enough on research into social mobility in Lithuania. Such a case is partly understandable as the issue of ensuring social mobility has never been a prevailing one on the political agenda. This article seeks to describe different perspectives on measuring social mobility between generations in Lithuania and to present their empirical expressions. Intergenerational mobility is understood as the difference between the socio-economic situation of parents and adult children, i. y. a comparison of the persons current circumstances with those from which the person originated. Social positions that can be compared are usually based on occupational, income, education or other social class or socio-economic situation schemes. This article is based on European Social Survey data from wave 9 and reviews the intergenerational social mobility of 1970-1984 generation in terms of education, occupations, income and health dimensions. The results show that occupational and educational mobility increases between generations. There has been a significant decline in the number of people with only a basic education and at the lowest levels of the occupational scale. However, there is a lack of data on intergenerational social mobility in health and income. Therefore, conclusions about this mobility can only be drawn from the work of previous researchers. Intergenerational mobility can also be a tool to achieve greater economic efficiency. Low intergenerational mobility may mean that some individuals are unable to realize their talents due to their low socio-economic status. Therefore, in the light of the findings of the study, it would make sense to consider developing a social mobility strategy.",
    "729": "Although most studies of the transition from school to work take a snapshot perspective in examining economic returns to education, such returns evolve over an individuals lifetime. We empirically test a theoretical formulation derived from the cumulative advantage mechanism about enduring life-cycle effects of educational mobility on income. We analyse income trajectories for all Danes born in 19601961, and we consider how the welfare state may counteract certain mechanisms of intergenerational transmission that give children with college-educated parents better opportunities in the labour market. We find only small direct effects of parental college attainment on earnings trajectories after we control for offspring college attainment. Thus, schooling acts as a powerful and enduring economic leveller of family background effects in Denmark. Our analyses also show direct effects on trajectories in property income derived from wealth, suggesting that the welfare state has a harder time equalising income from wealth than from earnings.",
    "730": "Building upon prior research on intergenerational income mobility, we assess class effects versus racial effects on the probability of becoming a poor adult, broken down by gender. We define the class effect (for each race-and-gender group) as the difference between the probability that a person who was born into the lowest income quintile becomes poor and the probability that a person who was born into the highest income quintile becomes poor. For each minority-by-gender group, using Whites as the baseline, the racial effect is defined as the average racial differential in the probability of becoming a poor adult, irrespective of class origins. The results indicate that, for all minority-by-gender groups, the class effect is larger than the racial effect. Our findings underscore the continuing significance of the comparatively large effects of class origins, which have not been adequately acknowledged in recent research.",
    "731": "Although both childhood and adult economic conditions have been found to be associated with mortality, independently or in combination with each other, less is known about the role of intermediate factors between these two life stages. This study explores the pathways between childhood economic conditions and adult mortality by taking personal attributes as well as adult socioeconomic career into consideration. Further, we investigate the role of intergenerational income mobility for adult mortality. We used data from a prospective cohort study of individuals that were born in 1953 and residing in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1963 who were followed for mortality between 2002 and 2021 (n = 11,325) We fit Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association of parental income, cognitive ability, social skills, educational attainment, occupational status, and adult income with mortality. The income mobility is operationalized as the interaction between parental and adult income. Our results show that the association between parental income and adult mortality is modest and largely operates through cognitive ability and adult educational attainment. However, our results do not provide support for there being an effect of intergenerational income mobility on adult mortality. In a Swedish cohort who grew up in a comparatively egalitarian society during the 1950s and 1960s, childhood economic conditions were found to play a distinct but relatively small role for later mortality.",
    "732": "This paper combines cross-sectional and longitudinal income data to present the evolution of absolute intergenerational income mobility in ten advanced economies in the twentieth century. Absolute mobility decreased during the second half of the twentieth century in all of these countries. Increasing income inequality and decreasing growth rates have both contributed to the decrease, yet growth is the dominant contributor in most countries. We show that detailed panel data are effectively unnecessary for estimating absolute mobility over the long run. (JEL D31, J62, N30)",
    "733": "Public school funding depends heavily on local property tax revenue. Consequently, low-income households have limited access to quality education in neighborhoods with high house prices. In a dynamic life-cycle model with neighborhood choice and endogenous local school quality, we show that this property tax funding mechanism reduces intergenerational mobility and accounts for the spatial correlation between house prices and mobility. A housing voucher experiment improves access to schools, with benefits that can last for multiple generations. Additionally, a policy that redistributes property tax revenues equally across schools improves mobility and welfare. However, the benefits can take generations to be realized. (JEL H71, H75, I21, I22, J62, R23, R31)",
    "734": "There is a long history of studying intergenerational mobility using mobility tables or transition matrices. This approach has two potential limitations: each generation is typically divided into several equally sized income groups based on percentile ranking to create ad-hoc social classes or into predetermined broad occupational groups, and inter- and intragenerational changes in social class are not jointly analyzed. To address these limitations, we construct intergenerational income mobility tables using an alternative, group-based trajectory approach to determine the number of socioeconomic groups and characterize the development of social status over the course of individuals working lives. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (19682017) we show intergenerational differences in income dynamics as each generations life-cycle profile unfolds. Specifically, parents and offspring who, based on their average household incomes, belong to different income strata may have similar working life-course income trajectory patterns. As a result, by focusing exclusively on the average income levels, studies using income quintiles for mobility tables may underestimate intergenerational income associations.",
    "735": "We study how an elite college education affects social mobility in China. China provides an interesting context because its college admissions rely mainly on the scores of a centralized exam, a system that has been the subject of intense debate. Combining the data from a large-scale college graduate survey and a nationally representative household survey, we document three main findings. First, attending an elite college can change one's fate. It significantly raises the child's rank in the income distribution. Nevertheless, it does not change the intergenerational relationship in income ranks or guarantee one's entry into an elite occupation or industry. Second, although access to elite colleges increases with parental income, the income gradient is much flatter than in the United States. Third, the score-based cutoff rule in elite college admission is income neutral. Overall, these findings reveal the efficacy and limitations of China's elite colleges in shaping social mobility.",
    "736": "This paper provides the first estimates of intergenerational income mobility in Spain based on rich administrative data linking millions of parents and children through tax returns. Four main results arise. First, Spain is located somewhere in the middle between high-mobility countries such as Scandinavian countries and low-mobility ones such as the United States or Italy. Second, geographical variation in mobility rates is high in Spain but smaller than in other compared countries. Third, daughters have systematically worse outcomes in both relative and absolute mobility measures than sons, with a gender gap that amounts for almost 13% of per capita national income at the median of the distribution. Fourth, exploiting the high comparability degree of siblings that have the exact same values of observable characteristics, I document a positive effect of out-migration on various upward mobility outcomes.",
    "737": "This paper analyzes the impact of trade opening on intergenerational income flow from two dimensions: the proportion of trade opening and export structure. The empirical analysis is carried out by using the data of China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) from 1997 to 2015. The results show that the increase of the proportion of trade exports and the optimization of trade export structure will promote intergenerational income flow. In the adjustment process of Chinas trade development from total growth to structural optimization, the intergenerational income mobility of urban residents has been significantly improved, which provides an important way for China to improve the intergenerational mobility of low-income groups through the process of urbanization. The improvement of intergenerational income flow is attributed to the improvement of education level brought by trade opening. Trade opening improves the education level of children, and then promotes intergenerational income flow. Therefore, it is of great policy significance to expand opening-up, build an educational power and constantly promote the process of urbanization.",
    "738": "We extend the standard intergenerational mobility literature by examining the relationship between adult outcomes of children and the timing of parental income during their childhood years, using data from Norway. We find first that, conditional on permanent household income, the child's human capital is higher in households where income is balanced between the early childhood and late childhood years than in households with a more imbalanced income profile. Second, compared to that in the early and late periods of childhood, income in the middle period has relatively low productivity.",
    "739": "The recent backlash against globalization, including the Sino-US trade war and Brexit, has highlighted the discussion on the effect of trade on economic inequality. This paper employs a probit model to investigate the effect of trade liberalization on intergenerational income mobility based on micro-level data from China Health and Nutrition Survey and macro-level data from Regional Statistic Yearbooks in 1989-2015. Most notably, we study how industrialization and upward education mobility explain the underlying mechanisms of such effect. The results indicate that a high level of trade openness may promote upward income mobility for both sons and daughters and restrain downward income mobility for daughters. Therefore, China should keep up its process of reform and opening up, further eliminating trade barriers and strengthening international cooperation to provide equal opportunities of high-skilled occupations for individuals from different family backgrounds. Chinese families should be encouraged to provide equal educational opportunities for boys and girls.",
    "740": "This paper extends an intergenerational context to the prospect of upward mobility hypothesis, showing that the poor majority in democracies may not support massive redistribution for the sake of their childrens educational attainment and upward mobility. We develop an overlapping generations model in which human capital formation depends on individual effort and educational resources. Parents vote on redistributive policies under majority rule by considering the disincentive effects of high tax rates on childrens study efforts. We characterize the stationary Markov perfect equilibrium in which children respond negatively to the extent of redistribution, and parental altruism discourages poor voters from expropriating the rich. Under private education, a tax rate is only credible above a certain threshold, and childrens efforts and their parental inputs are complements in the steady state. Under public education, a credible policy embodies a moderate income tax combined with a small educational fund. Under both school systems, the optimal credible tax increases with wage inequality and decreases as parental altruism becomes stronger.",
    "741": "This paper studies intergenerational mobilitythe transmission of family influence. We develop and estimate measures of lifetime resources (income and wealth) motivated by economic theory that account for generational differences in life-cycle trajectories, uncertainty, and credit constraints. These measures of lifetime resources allow us to estimate the transmission of welfare and lifetime resources at different stages of the life cycle. We compare these measures with traditional ones such as wage income and disposable income measured over narrow windows of age that are used to proxy lifetime wealth. The performance of proxy measures is poor. Parents' expected lifetime resources are stronger predictors of many important child outcomes (including children's own expected lifetime resources and education) than the income measures traditionally used in the literature on social mobility. Changes in patterns of educational attainment across generations explain most of the intergenerational change in life-cycle dynamics. While relative mobility is overstated by the traditional income measures, absolute upward mobility is understated. Recent generations have higher welfare and are better off compared to their parents.",

    "743": "Ethiopia's recent experiment with a developmental state model delivered double-digit economic growth and significant expansion of public services for nearly two decades. However, a wave of violent protests that began in 2014 culminated in a leadership change and the termination of the developmental experiment in 2018 as well as a regionalised civil war in 2020. In this working paper, we explore why Ethiopia yet again succumbed to political violence and instability by investigating the relationships between ethnic behaviour, economic development and political violence in the period 19972020. First, we explore trends in economic growth, horizontal and vertical economic inequality, as well as social mobility under Ethiopia's developmental state. Secondly, we account for temporal and geographic patterns and correlates of political violence in 19972019 by using ACLED data. Finally, we account for the microfoundations of political discontent using survey data on political preferences from 2020. Our survey data explores perceptions of individual and group-level relative deprivation, aspiration gaps, future expectations and social mobility. Our data and analysis indicate that Ethiopia maintained relatively low levels of horizontal inequality but that vertical inequality was poorly managed, which manifested itself through among other things low intergenerational mobility. We also find that political violence was driven by grievances (measured through economic vulnerability and repression) opportunity structures for mobilisation (measured through urbanisation and youth demographics) and the ethno-national composition of administrative districts. Contrary to the macro-level economic data, our micro-level survey data indicates that inter-group economic grievances trump perceptions of vertical or individual relative deprivation. Finally, we also test the extent to which political discontent is a function of increased aspirations that are stimulated by improved material well-being and thereby high aspiration gaps or what is known as the 'Tocqueville paradox' We find no support for this counter-intuitive relationship in Ethiopia, as various indicators of frustration were negatively correlated with income.",

Since parents incomes are not observed, we employ a two-sample two-stage least squares estimation. Our results show that France is characterized by a strong persistence relative to other developed countries.10% of children born to parents in the bottom 20% reach the top 20% in adulthood, four times less than children from the top 20% We uncover substantial spatial variations in intergenerational mobility across departments, comparable to those observed across countries. We find that the upward mobility gains from geographic mobility are slightly decreasing in parent income and increasing in the income level of the destination department. The expected income rank of individuals from the bottom of the parent income distribution who moved towards high-income departments is around the same as the expected income rank of individuals from the 75th percentile who stayed in their childhood department.",
    "745": "The COVID-19 crisis has caused a huge negative shock to economic activities worldwide, leading to a reduction in income and changes in income distribution. Intergenerational mobility is an important indicator of sustainable social development. This paper explores the short-term impacts of the sudden COVID-19 pandemic on intergenerational income mobility and personal income in China. Using the variation in the number of confirmed cases across provinces, we construct a province-level pandemic intensity index and combine it with individual data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) We apply a general difference-in-difference strategy to identify the causal effect of the pandemic on intergenerational income mobility. We find that personal income is positively related to parental income, and that the COVID-19 crisis has caused a decline in individual income and exacerbated intergenerational income persistence. A more intense COVID-19 pandemic shock is associated with a larger increase in intergenerational income elasticity and intergenerational income rank-rank slope. We found that with one standard deviation increase in local pandemic intensity, the intergenerational income elasticity increases by 0.315 and the intergenerational income rank-rank slope increases by 0.198 on average. The mechanism testing suggests that heterogeneous effects among different groups are the force underlying the results. Low-income, low-skilled, and low-parental-income individuals have suffered a more severe impact from the pandemic shock.",
    "746": "The effect of education on income has been debated in recent years. We use the China Health and Nutrition Survey database to research the relationship between education upward mobility and income upward mobility. We find education upward mobility has a positive effect on income upward mobility. The intergenerational psychological distance which is a measure of the difference between parents' and children's conceptualizations, parents' social capital, and children's gender all have effects on this relationship. To be specific, the positive effect is reinforced by a certain amount of intergenerational psychological distance, but is negated by an excessive amount of intergenerational psychological distance. Besides, education upward mobility actively increases the income upward mobility of rural-dwelling children whose parents lack social capital, i.e. education is a key factor that improves the income of children from rural families. In contrast, education upward mobility only actively increases the income upward mobility of urban-dwelling children whose parents have social capital. In addition, the positive effect of education on children's income is more evident in boys than in girls. These findings greatly advance our understanding of the beneficial effects of education on the income, and will assist improvements to be made in these areas.",
    "747": "Intergenerational persistence in studying for elite education is high across the world. We study the role that exposure to high school peers from elite educated families ('elite peers') plays in driving such a phenomenon in Norway. Using register data on ten cohorts of high school students and exploiting within school, between cohort variation, we identify the causal impact of elite peers on the probability of enrolling in elite education for students from different socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. We show that exposure to elite peers in high school does drive enrolment into elite degree programmes, but the effect for low SES students is a third of the size than for high SES students. We explore mechanisms behind this pattern finding that elite peers have a complex effect on students' GPA which is a key part of the story. Elite peers increase the effort of both low and high SES students, but they also push the rank of other students down and trigger a change in teacher behaviour which disadvantages low SES students. To quantify the contribution of this mechanism, we perform a causal mediation analysis exploiting a lottery in the assessment system in Norway to instrument GPA. We find that the indirect effect of elite peers on enrolment through GPA explains just less than half of the total peer effect. Our concluding analysis shows that elite peers in high school raises intergenerational mobility for poor students, but increases persistence for rich students, thereby simultaneously facilitating first generation elite whilst contributing to the high intergenerational persistence at the top of the education and income distribution.",
    "748": "We calibrate a sequence of four nested models to study the dynamics of wealth accumulation. Individuals maximize a utility function whose arguments are consumption and investment. They desire to accumulate wealth for its own sake this is not a life-cycle model. A competitive firm produces a single good from labor and capital; the rate of return to capital and the wage rate are market-clearing. The second model introduces political lobbying by the wealthy, whose purpose is to reduce the tax rate on capital income. The third model introduces differential rates of return to capitals of different sizes. The fourth model introduces inheritance and intergenerational mobility.",
    "749": "The IGE of income is considered one of the best measures of the degree to which a society gives equal opportunity to its members. While much research has been devoted to measuring this reduced-form parameter, less is known about its underlying structural determinants. Using a model with exogenous talent endowments, endogenous parental investment in children and endogenous redistributive institutions, we identify the structural parameters that govern the IGE of income. The model clarifies how the interaction between private and collective decisions determines the equilibrium level of social mobility. Two societies with similar economic and biological fundamentals may have vastly different degrees of intergenerational mobility depending on their political institutions. We offer empirical evidence in line with the predictions of the model. We conclude that international comparisons of IGE of income are not particularly informative about fairness without taking into account differences in politico-economic institutions.",
    "750": "Ideal estimates of the IGE (IGE) in income require a large panel of income data covering the entire working lifetimes for two generations.Previous studies have demonstrated that using short panels and covering only certain portions of the lifecycle can lead to considerable bias.A recent influential study by Chetty et al (2014) using tax data estimates the IGE in family income for the entire U.S. to be 0.344, considerably lower than most previous estimates.Despite the seeming advantages of extremely large samples of administrative tax data, I demonstrate that the age structure and limited panel dimension of the data used by Chetty et al leads to considerable downward bias in estimating the IGE.Specifically I use PSID samples that overcome the data limitations in the tax data to estimate the IGE when using long time averages centered around age 40 in both generations.I demonstrate how imposing the data limitations in Chetty et al (2014) lead to considerable downward bias relative to these preferred estimates.I further demonstrate that the sensitivity checks in Chetty et al regarding the age at which children's income is measured and the length of the time average of parent income used to estimate the IGE are also flawed due to these data limitations.The lack of robustness of the IGE to the treatment of years of zero earnings among children found by Chetty et al is also largely due to data limitations.Estimates of the rank-rank slope on the other hand are much less downward biased and tend to be more robust to the limitations of the tax data.Nevertheless, researchers should continue to use both the IGE and rank based measures depending on which concept of mobility they wish to address.Substantively, I find that the IGE in family income in the U.S. is likely greater than 0.6 and that the rank-rank slope is 0.4 or higher.",
    "751": "The causal link between family size and human capital investment in children is critical for family planning policy. However, empirical studies aiming to test the quantityquality trade-off are far from sufficient. This paper tried to estimate the family-size effect on intergenerational income mobility using China Family Panel Survey (CFPS) data. The empirical model of intergenerational income mobility with respective to family size was formulated, and the fertility rates allowed by family planning policy were used as an instrument variable for family size. It was found that intergenerational income elasticity tended to decrease with an increase in family size. The impact of family size on intergenerational income elasticity was sensitive to the income rank positions, and nonlinearity in intergenerational transmission of income under unequal family was observed. A quantityquality trade-off analysis was applied to further test the family-size effect. Pronounced family-size effects were observed in low-income regions with tight budget constraints and in regions with less-developed credit markets, followed by an obvious quantityquality trade-off. The sex difference in intergenerational transmission of income may be attributed to the existence of the preference to sons over daughters phenomenon. The present work provides a theoretical basis for shaping family planning policies toward sustainability.",
    "752": "There is an increasing interest in the subjective aspect of socioeconomic position and its implications for wellbeing across social science disciplines. One of the emerging dimensions of this scholarship is research on perceived social mobility, its determinants, and consequences. To date, most existing evidence in this area is based on cross-sectional data and corresponding methods, which are biased by the unobserved heterogeneity of individuals. The latter calls into question existing findings on the nature of perceived social mobility. To provide more robust estimates of trends over time and explanations of perceived social mobility, we explore two complementary datasets covering the period between the late 1990s and the late 2010s in Poland. Due to the major economic, political and social changes, exploring subjective perceptions of intergenerational mobility might be particularly important in post-communist settings. The analysis allows us to conclude that, over the last two decades, significant changes in perceived social mobility have taken place in Poland. In terms of the individual-level predictors of this trend, cross-sectional and random-effects analyses over-estimate the importance of certain characteristics, such as age, education, or size of locality, yet, based on the results from more robust fixed-effects estimates, we conclude that factors such as subjective social position, household income, and objective social mobility are important explanations as to why some people believe they are doing better or worse than their parents.",
    "753": "Intergenerational social mobility and its associations with youth well-being has scarcely been examined in Greece. This study examines educational and income mobility across generations, its relations with emerging adults well-being, and the impact of interpersonal and contextual factors on this relationship, such as parental school involvement and the recent severe socio-economic crisis in Greece. 468 female and male University students and graduates completed a questionnaire battery, using two different modes: pen-and-pencil and online. The questionnaire assessed demographics, including information about educational levels for youths, parents and grandparents of both genders, and income (for the former two) flourishing and quality of life, as well as parental involvement, and the impact of the crisis on youths. The results revealed upward educational mobility across three generations. Intergenerational mobility was significantly, and positively associated with youth well-being. Parental involvement mediated the relation between social mobility and flourishing, while the impact of the socio-economic crisis mediated the relationship among mobility, flourishing, and quality of life in emerging adulthood. The implications of these findings on educational, mental health and other types of interventions are discussed. Lastly, the two modes of questionnaire assessment were found to be equivalent, a finding that can facilitate research in other trying times, such as health pandemics.",
    "754": "Studies about intergenerational income mobility are increasingly popular across the social sciences. These studies require individuals own incomes and their parents incomes to be observed prospectively across decades. Because this longitudinal observation is less difficult among third-and-higher generation persons than among 1.5- and second-generation persons (particularly undocumented 1.5-generation immigrants) studies of intergenerational income mobility risk underrepresenting 1.5- and second-generation persons. This article investigates this underrepresentation of people from immigrant families and provides an analytic framework that adjusts for this underrepresentation in studies of intergenerational income mobility. Using data on the experiences of two US birth cohorts, early baby boomers (born 19481953) and late generation Xers/early millennials (born 19781983) we illustrate our method of adjusting for the underrepresentation of 1.5- and second-generation persons. We find that within the late generation-X/early-millennial cohort, the underrepresentation of 1.5- and second-generation persons does not substantially bias intergenerational income mobility estimates. However, inferences about change across cohorts are more affected by the underrepresentation of 1.5- and second-generation persons in data used to estimate intergenerational income mobility because the population shares of these groups grew across the two cohorts. We discuss how our approach can be applied to other settings, including other countries, and to cross-country comparisons. We encourage future research on these comparisons because the underrepresentation of 1.5- and second-generation persons might substantially affect understanding of cross-national income mobility differences.",
    "755": "Intergenerational income mobility has been widely concerned focusing mainly on the transmission mechanism within families. This paper turns to explore the structural determinants and pays special attentions to the role of intergovernmental transfer. Since the fiscal decentralization in 1990s, intergovernmental transfers become an increasingly critical part in Chinese fiscal system, balancing the fiscal capacities across regions and promoting the equalization of public goods. The question arises naturally as whether transfers targeting at equalization can boost intergenerational mobility. However, little work has investigated this intersection of studies and seldom is known about this question. This paper tries to shed some new lights. Through investigations, it confirms that intergovernmental transfers weaken the income persistence and the effect is especially significant for urban areas; the effects for the rural are mixed. Further explorations indicate that the special-purpose transfer payment has greater effects when measured during college period; notably, entering college may bring the rural children fundamental changes relative to other levels of education. In conclusion, the intergovernmental transfer system is relatively more pro-urban. To better fulfill the equalizing effect of the intergovernmental transfers on both static inequality across regions and dynamic inequality across generations, should the transfers be re-framed with cautions tilting more towards the rural.Meanwhile, the competitive behaviors and (dis)incentives of the local governments should also be taken into accounts.",
    "756": "This paper makes use of the Markov Switching model and the K-Means Cluster analysis to estimate the transition probabilities of social mobility and to analyze the impact of social inequalities on intergenerational social mobility. The dataset is a sample of 44 countries and comprises the 2018 social mobility indices, and the 2018 or latest income inequality measures. The data are collected from the OECD Income and Wealth Distribution Databases, and from the world economic forum. It was found that the likelihood of moving upward or downward the social ladder is minimal in both developed and emerging countries. In addition, the paper found that the hypothesis according to which high-income countries have a higher relative social mobility is not necessarily true. The United States, a high-income country, was found to have a lower social mobility, similar to that of Turkey and South Africa. Furthermore, it was found that when poverty decreases, intergenerational social mobility increases in both lower and higher mobility countries. Policies that promote equality of opportunities at all stages of life are therefore recommended to improve intergenerational social mobility.",
    "757": "Numerous studies have found that income inequality reduces the chances of upward relative mobility (i.e. climbing up the income ladder) However, most of this work ignores the role played by institutional quality (namely, economic freedom) in determining mobility and increasing the individual's set of choices. We fill this gap by empirically testing the direct and indirect (through economic growth) impacts of economic freedom on intergenerational income mobility. We find that economic freedom has both direct and indirect effects on intergenerational income mobility, while income inequality is a strong predictor of downward income mobility. When we incorporate findings about the purely mechanical relationship between inequality and intergeneration income mobility, we find that the legal system and property rights component of economic freedom matters more than inequality. These results suggest that good institutions can increase intergenerational income mobility.",
    "758": "We use full-population data to study trends in intergenerational absolute income mobility, measured as the ratio of children earning more than their parents, for 11 Swedish cohorts born 19721983. Absolute mobility during this period increases from 72% to 84% for men and from 76% to 86% for womenhigher figures than in most other countries studied. To explain these results, we outline a novel decomposition strategy that accounts for cohort variation in parent-generation income inequality. All else equal, if income inequality is higher in the parent generation, more economic growth is required to achieve any given level of absolute mobility. We discuss implications for comparative research in intergenerational income mobility.",
    "759": "We provide the first estimates of intergenerational income mobility for a developing country, namely Brazil. We measure formal income from tax and employment registries, and we train machine learning models on census and survey data to predict informal income. The data reveal a much higher degree of persistence than previous estimates available for developed economies: a 10 percentile increase in parental income rank is associated with a 5.5 percentile increase in child income rank, and persistence is even higher in the top 5% Children born to parents in the first income quintile face a 46% chance of remaining at the bottom when adults. We validate these estimates using two novel mobility measures that rank children and parents without the need to impute informal income. We document substantial heterogeneity in mobility across individual characteristics notably gender and race and across Brazilian regions. Leveraging children who migrate at different ages, we estimate that causal place effects explain 57% of the large spatial variation in mobility. Finally, assortative mating plays a strong role in household income persistence, and parental income is also strongly associated with several key long-term outcomes such as education, teenage pregnancy, occupation, mortality, and victimization.",
    "760": "The idea of a cycle of deprivation, posited by the late Sir Keith Joseph, is again shaping policy in Whitehall. The authors question the extent to which the reappearance of Josephs ideas of a transmission of disadvantage between generations is justified by research. Three bodies of evidence are reviewed: studies of mobility; life-course analysis; and research that unravels the possible processes that produce intergenerational transmission. They conclude that, while intergenerational continuities exist, their apparent scale is magnified by the dynamics of social mobility. Evidence as to the mechanisms involved is fragile but hints that family processes are only important in the context of low income, and that education both propels social advance and traps the disadvantaged.",
    "761": "Using administrative data, we provide an extensive characterization of labor earnings dynamics in Norway. Some of our findings are as follows: (i) Norway has not been immune to the increase in top earnings inequality seen in other countries, (ii) the earnings distribution compresses in the bottom 90% over the life cycle but expands in the top 10% and (iii) the earnings growth distribution is leftskewed and leptokurtic, and the extent of these nonnormalities varies with age and past income. Linking individuals to their parents, we also investigate the intergenerational transmission of income dynamics We find that children of highincome, highwealth fathers enjoy steeper income growth over the life cycle and face more volatile but more positively skewed income changes, suggesting that they are more likely to pursue highreturn, highrisk careers. Income growth for children of poorer fathers is more gradual and more left skewed, displaying higher left tail risk. Furthermore, the income dynamics of fathers and children are strongly correlated: children of fathers with steeper lifecycle income growth, more volatile incomes, or higher downside risk also have income streams of similar properties. These findings shed new light on the determinants of intergenerational mobility.",

    "763": "This paper provides new evidence on the causal impacts of city-wide racial segregation on intergenerational mobility. We use an instrumental variable approach that relies on plausibly exogenous variation in segregation due to the arrangement of railroad tracks in the nineteenth century. Our analysis finds that higher segregation reduces upward mobility for Black children from households across the income distribution and White children from low-income households. Moreover, segregation lowers academic achievement while increasing incarceration and teenage birth rates. An analysis of mechanisms shows that segregation reduces government spending, weakens support for anti-poverty policies, and increases racially conservative attitudes for White residents.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

    "765": "The degree of variance in social circumstances between parents and offspring is referred to as intergenerational mobility or \"fluidity. In a society with high intergenerational mobility (relative or absolute) a person's welfare is less influenced by their parents' social status. When a society's mobility is limited, a person's likelihood of prosperity in life is dictated by their birth accident, which is in violation of the society's fundamental rights. The socio-economic structure and culture that have developed in India based on ancient religious rules and the concept of frightening impurity and uncleanness has exacerbated class disparity. Physical work is regarded as an inferiorkind of employment, and elite society fully excludes them from such labor-intensive occupations. Despite the fact that wealthy Hindus have become the affluent class and many lower caste people have been exiled to the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid, the situation has remained largely unaltered. In our paper, we have examined the role of intergenerational income immobility due to intergenerational educational immobility on the poverty gap using FGT index as distributional statistic between forward caste (FC) and lower caste (OBC-Other Backward Class, SC- scheduled Caste & ST-Scheduled Tribe) children and it has looked with seriously at how reservation policy has helped to reduce poverty among backward societies since independence. To complete the objectives we have used The India Human Development Survey 2012(IHDS-II) data set which is a nationally representative, multi-topic survey and the data set consists of 33377 (15-65 aged) child-parent combinations after dropping all currently enrolled students. We have used Oaxaca-Blinder RIF regression model considering FosterGreerThorbecke (FGT) indices as distributional statistics to understand the incidence of poverty, depth of poverty and poverty severity gap among upper and lower caste, and how the exogenous factors affecting the gap. Our result shows 9.3% FC, 18% SC/ST and 16.7% OBC child significantly lies under below poverty line (Incidence ofPoverty) category. On the other hand, 4.4% UC, 8.6% SC/ST and 8.2% OBC child suffer from the depth of poverty. We also find 2.8% FC, 5.6% SC/ST and 5.3% OBC child suffers from severity poverty. We find the gap in incidence of poverty, depth of poverty and severity of poverty between FC and SC/ST, and between FC and OBC are 8.6% 4.2% 2.8% and 7.4% 3.8% 2.5% respectively. The result shows reservation policy reduces the poverty gap among FC and all backward caste. On the other hand, intergenerational income immobility due tointergenerational educational immobility helps to increase poverty. The service composition, regional composition, employment status, household characteristics, Age composition and educational attainment reduce the poverty gap between FC and lower caste. As there is still a poverty gap between upper and lower caste, the reservation policy should remain as it was. The opportunity for education among the children of the backward society should be further enhanced.",
    "766": "Rent-control advocates argue that its strongest feature is offering tenants strong protections from economic displacement. Nonetheless, rent control may have negative effects on tenants, as previous research has shown that these tenants have longer commutes and higher unemployment rates because they are incentivized to stay in place even after their location is no longer optimal. I study what happens to tenants when they are displaced from their rent-controlled apartments by exploiting a California law called the Ellis Act that allows landlords in Los Angeles and San Francisco to evict tenants even if they are lease-compliant, under the condition that all the tenants in the building must be evicted at once and are compensated by the landlord with substantial relocation payments. In large apartment buildings (five units or more) these Ellis Act evictions act as an exogenous shock because these landlords are unlikely to be evicting all their tenants just to target an individual household. Using Infutor data, I identify over 900,000 people who lived in a five-plus unit rent-controlled apartment in either San Francisco or Los Angeles in 1999, 11,470 of whom were evicted between 2000 and 2007. I find that evicted tenants were less likely to stay in their original city and more likely to live in lower-income and lower-intergenerational-mobility neighborhoods than control tenants. The negative effects of these evictions appear to be highly persistent: neighborhood socioeconomic status is lower for the evicted group than the control group at least 12 years ex post. These findings support that the Ellis Act imposes steep costs on tenants and may be partially undermining Californias recent attempts to improve housing affordability and stability.",
    "767": "We propose a multivariate approach for the estimation of intergenerational transition matrices. Our methodology is grounded on the assumption that individuals social status is unobservable and must be estimated. In this framework, parents and offspring are clustered on the basis of the observed levels of income and occupational categories, thus avoiding any discretionary rule in the definition of class boundaries. The resulting transition matrix is a function of the posterior probabilities of parents and young adults of belonging to each class. Estimation is carried out via maximum likelihood by means of an expectation-maximization algorithm. We illustrate the proposed method using National Longitudinal Survey Data from the United States in the period 1978-2006.",
    "768": "We study whether racial disparities in economic opportunity appear at an early age. Using administrative education data linked to tax records, we study the income-achievement gap across different races and find important variation. The income-achievement gap is small for East Asian children while it is close to twice as large for Indigenous children. Sorting by income into schools accounts for a large portion of the variation in the income-achievement gap across all student groups. In addition, our results suggest that the large income-achievement gap for Indigenous students may be rooted in inequality in health outcomes and poor housing conditions. Our findings on income-achievement gaps across race could partially explain the different intergenerational mobility outcomes by race documented by others.",
    "769": "The article is about intergenerational mobility one of the most important factors determining both the level of actual inequality in a society and the willingness of such society to tolerate this level. First part of the article provides a review of modern literature on quantitative estimates of intergenerational mobility. The main indicators and discussion issues related to the accuracy of assessing intergenerational mobility are considered, as well as methods for assessing the reasons for the dependence of heirs income on parental income. Second part provides an overview of the main approaches used in applied research in this area. Among them are the comparison of intergenerational mobility across countries and its relationship with social inequality, changes in intergenerational mobility over time, and the relationship between intergenerational mobility and economic growth. Particular attention is paid to the results of applied research based on Russian data. The original character of the work is in the fact that, giving an overview of research in the field of intergenerational mobility, the authors address not only the issue of what certain researchers claimed, but also what methods are used in the literature on intergenerational mobility to support the conclusions.",
    "770": "Rank-based measures of intergenerational mobility are generally justified by their invariance to changes in inequality. However, I show that whenever the source of inequality is uncorrelated to parent ranks, such as in the cases of gender and birth order, increasing equality leads to a fall in rank mobility as measured by the rank correlation. I develop a method to ex-post quantify the importance of inequality for mobility measurement using cross-sectional income distributions and show that US income mobility could have fallen by as much as 24 percent since 1970 due to increased gender equality. Without specifying a policy objective of interest, it is therefore unclear which conclusions to draw from differences in rank-correlations across societies or from changes over time.",
    "771": "This paper develops an approach to intergenerational mobility in which the trajectories of parental incomes during childhood and adolescence are the conditioning objects for characterizing dependence across generations. We use functional regression methods to produce an IGE curve that measures how marginal changes in income at each age affect expected offspring permanent income. Using the PSID, estimates of this curve exhibit near monotonicity with respect to age, so that parental incomes in middle childhood and adolescence have larger marginal effects than incomes in early childhood. When interactions are allowed to occur between incomes at different ages, we find a complex pattern of substitutability between incomes at ages that are close in time versus complementarity between parental incomes for ages early childhood and adolescence. Qualitatively similar results hold for offspring education while we do not find evidence of age-specific effects for occupation. We conclude that important information about the links between parental incomes and children exists beyond the scalar characterization of parental permanent income.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

    "773": "We characterize the eects of neighborhoods on children's earnings and other outcomes in adulthood by studying more than five million families who move across counties in the U.S. Our analysis consists of two parts.In the first part, we present quasi-experimental evidence that neighborhoods aect intergenerational mobility through childhood exposure eects.In particular, the outcomes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood -as measured by the outcomes of children already living there -improve linearly in proportion to the time they spend growing up in that area.We distinguish the causal eects of neighborhoods from confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place eects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles.We also document analogous childhood exposure eects for college attendance, teenage birth rates, and marriage rates.In the second part of the paper, we identify the causal eect of growing up in every county in the U.S. by estimating a fixed eects model identified from families who move across counties with children of dierent ages.We use these estimates to decompose observed intergenerational mobility into a causal and sorting component in each county.For children growing up in families at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (SD) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5%.Hence, growing up in a one SD better county from birth increases a child's income by approximately 10%.Low-income children are most likely to succeed in counties that have less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates.Boys' outcomes vary more across areas than girls, and boys have especially poor outcomes in highly-segregated areas.In urban areas, better areas have higher house prices, but our analysis uncovers significant variation in neighborhood quality even conditional on prices.",
    "774": "We extend a standard model of parental investment and intergenerational mobility to include a fully specified genetic analysis of skill transmission. The models predictions differ substantially from the standard models. The coefficient of intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) may be larger than that in the standard model and depends on the distribution of the genotype. The distribution of genetic endowments may be stratified according to income. The model is tested on data, including genetic information, of twins and their parents, estimating how IGE is affected by genetic factors and how environment and genes interact. The effect of intelligence is substantially stronger than that of other traits.",
    "775": "This paper presents a new approach to measuring the intergenerational transmission of well-being and a novel perspective on which measures and what age ranges to use to estimate intergenerational social mobility. We select the measures and the age ranges that best predict important human capital outcomes of children. The predictive power of parental resources varies among measures of parental resources as well as the age ranges used to measure them. Lifetime measures outperform traditional snapshot proxies for lifetime incomes based on income flows at certain age windows in predicting child outcomes, regardless of the ages when child outcomes are measured. The sensitivity of IGE estimates to the ages at which parental resources are measured is far smaller than their sensitivity to whether lifetime measures are used or whether snapshot measures are used. We also find that the financial resources of parents compensate in part for non-monetary inputs to child human capital such as the stability of the family and education of parents. We interpret our estimates using the technology of skill formation modified to account for the emergence of new skills in adolescence.",

    "778": "This paper studies intergenerational links in home ownership, an increasingly important wealth marker and a measure of economic status in itself. Repeated cross sectional UK data show that home ownership rates have fallen rapidly over time, most markedly amongst younger people in more recent birth cohorts. Evidence from British birth cohorts data supplemented by the Wealth and Assets Survey show a significant rise through time in the intergenerational persistence of home ownership, as home ownership rates shrank disproportionately among those whose parents did not own their own home. Given the close connection between home ownership and wealth, these results on strengthening intergenerational persistence in home ownership are therefore also suggestive of a fall in intergenerational housing wealth mobility over time.",
    "779": "This research analyzes intergenerational income mobility over three generations in Taiwan by estimating intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) Results indicate that IGE between fathers and sons is 0.349, and IGE between fathers and grandsons is 0.139. Fathers death during grandsons early ages does not affect IGE between them, and the independent effect of fathers income on grandsons income is weak. Roughly, 65% of IGE between fathers and grandsons is explained by sons couples income. Quantile results show that IGE between fathers and grandsons is stronger at upper tail of fathers income distribution, and it is especially strong for extremely rich grandsons.",
    "780": "This paper examines to what extent intergenerational mobility shapes both the impact of income inequality on growth as well as the effect that growth has on poverty and on income inequality in Africa. Thanks to newly available and internationally comparable data on intergenerational elasticities of income and education, we confirm the detrimental role played by higher inequality of opportunity as measured by intergenerational mobility. The study concludes that neglecting to address the root causes of inequality of opportunity can be socially and economically very costly.",
    "781": "Grandchildren of post-World War II immigrants have started entering the labor market in Western Europe. Are they on a multigenerational path toward full economic assimilation, much like the European migrant groups in US classical assimilation theory? This paper assesses the degree of economic assimilation of third-generation descendants of immigrants with divergent initial socioeconomic positions in the Netherlands. Given the diversity in starting positions of various migrant groups, we fully account for parental (economic) disadvantages from an intergenerational mobility perspective by making use of rich register data. Looking at adult children aged 2030 and their (grand)parents, we quantify the Dutch-third-generation gap in incomes and wealth by employing a rankrank analysis to identify ethnic disparities in absolute and relative intergenerational income mobility. Our analysis reveals that third-generation descendants of immigrants generally reach parity with their native-Dutch counterparts, regardless of their initial position when we control for socioeconomic conditions. The results signify a diminishing role of group-specific barriers across generations for all groups. As such, the third-generation descendants of disadvantaged migrants appear to be on a track toward economic assimilation, regardless of their ethno-national origin. Our conclusion highlights implications for policy and public debates on ethnic disparities.",
    "782": "This paper extends a canonical model of intergenerational human capital investment to a geographic context to study the role of migration in influencing income mobility in the United States. The main result is that migration is considerably influential in shaping the high rates of economic mobility observed among children from low-wage areas, with human capital investment behavioral responses being important to consider. Equalizing school quality across locations does more to reduce interstate inequality in income mobility than equalizing skill prices, and policies that attempt to decrease human capital flight from low-wage areas via cash transfers are unlikely to be cost-effective.",
    "783": "We show how intergenerational mobility has evolved over time in Sweden and the United States since 1985, focusing on prime-age labor incomes of both men and women. Income persistence involving women (daughters and/or mothers) has risen substantially over recent decades in both Sweden and the US, while the more predominantly studied father-son measures remained roughly stable. Interestingly, mother-son and mother-daughter persistence levels are very similar as they rise through the sample period, also to nearly the same levels in both countries, contrary to well-established elevated levels of persistence in the US relative to Sweden. We develop a model to quantify the relative roles of parent human capital, employment, and (residual) income, as well as assortative mating. Despite very similar trends and levels for mothers in the US and Sweden, we find substantial differences in the roles of employment and assortative mating over time, consistent with the staggered timing in womens spike in labor force attachment. Parental assortative mating is also an important factor in both countries, though negative sorting on (residual) income in the US negates the upward influence of positive human capital sorting, lending to the similar cross-country levels of mother-child persistence.",

    "785": "This study aims to examine how mothers poverty differently affects young adult childrens self-esteem over time. We consider how young adult childrens income moderates the between-subject relationship and the within-subject relationship. This study used two data sets such as the NLSY79 and the NLSY79CY. We used six waves from 2004 to 2014. A total of 3975 motheradult child dyads were chosen. The hybrid model was employed to explore both the between-subject and the within-subject relationship. There was a significant between-subject relationship regarding the effect of mothers poverty and adult childrens income on adult childrens self-esteem. In the between-subjects relationship, an interaction effect was found, such that childrens income moderated the between-subject relationship between mothers poverty and childrens self-esteem. Long-term anti-poverty programs should be provided to women with children even after they completely are away from poverty. Minimizing inequality in intergenerational economic mobility may be critical to enhance adult childrens self-esteem.",
    "786": "The authors use administrative data linked to parish records from northern Sweden to study how persistent inequality is across multiple generations in education, occupation, and wealth, going from historical to contemporary time. The data cover seven generations and allow the authors to follow ancestors of individuals living in Sweden around the new millennium back more than 200 years, covering the mid-18th century to the 21st century. In a sample of around 75,000 traceable descendants, they analyze (a) up to fifth cousin correlations and (b) dynastic correlations over seven generations based on aggregations of ancestors' social class/status. With both approaches, the authors find that past generations structure life chances many generations later, even though the results align with traditional stratification research in that mobility across multiple generations is high. The results imply that today's inequality regime may have been formed many generations back.",

Using a novel mobility measure based on relative educational positions, the author compares racial mobility flows across the entire schooling distribution. The empirical analysis reveals widespread equalization among blacks and whites in upward mobility out of the bottom of the schooling distribution but widespread persistence in black disadvantage in downward mobility out of the top of the schooling distribution. These findings are consistent with a pattern of differentially maintained educational advantage, suggesting a lasting significance of race among well-educated families. The author presents some possible explanations for these findings and discusses how they align with reported black-white differences in intergenerational income mobility.",
    "788": "Using China Family Panel Studies data, this paper analyzes intergenerational mobility of relative poverty and its mechanism through transition matrix, Probit model, 2SLS model and Bowles-Gintis decomposition method. The results show that 76.0% of the offspring with relatively poor parents exit relative poverty, and only 23.9% of the offspring with not relatively poor parents become relatively poor. Parents' income affects offspring's mainly through offspring's work, rather than their education. One possible reason is that early engagement in manual work crowds out their educational acquisition. Furthermore, women are disadvantaged in the intergenerational mobility. Reducing the cost of education, improving the quality of employment and focusing on female groups will better facilitate intergenerational mobility in rural China.",

Combining microdata from tax authorities with education records we compute a measure of permanent income as well as education. We estimate the degree of intergenerational persistence in education and income in the population and across time, showing that it is higher than what previous estimates would suggest, albeit it appears to be decreasing. Finally, exploiting information on the education of grandparents, we estimate a model of intergenerational mobility in which endowments are transmitted through a latent factor. Estimates suggest an even higher persistence.",
    "790": "Social relationships across and within generations are associated with intergenerational income mobility. Parents affect their childrens future opportunities through socialization and by conveying various resources to the child during upbringing. However, self-acquired social contacts of children, such as friendships in school, might also affect long-term outcomes. Children from less privileged homes may gain access to additional resources through contact with privileged friends and their parents. This study examines whether having a classroom friend with high parental income (privileged friend) is associated with upward income mobility. Furthermore, it explores where in the parental income distribution a privileged friend matters most. We use data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study (n = 10,641) which is a prospective study of individuals born in 1953 who lived in the greater Stockholm area in 1963. We fit classroom fixed-effects models to estimate the association between having a privileged childhood friend and adult income as well as parental income and adult income along with the interaction of privileged friend and parental income. Results show that cohort members who had a privileged classroom friend had higher adult income, and that this income gain was greater among those whose parents belonged to the lowest income quartile, compared with those whose parents had higher incomes. These results are robust to adjustments for childhood socioeconomic background, personal attributes, and adult educational attainment. Our findings indicate that having an economically privileged friend in the school class bolsters adult income and upward income mobility of children from families with low income.",

This extends previous evidence in several directions, with a focus on younger cohorts of individuals born between 1973 and 1992. I find evidence of considerable intergenerational persistence in the transmission of resources at the household level with an IGE of 0.26 and a rank coefficient of 0.30. This picture of mobility remains at the individual level and under a range of robustness tests that address traditional methodological concerns. While mobility is relatively low at the national level, I find meaningful differences in income mobility rates across the country. More generally, regions with lower income in the North of England display substantially lower levels of both relative and absolute income mobility than regions in the South.",

Its purpose is to explore these processes and to analyse the differences between the fields of study. The second-generation mobility theories, which serve to be the theoretical background of this paper, focus on the differences between income, education, occupational groups and social classes in connection with status attainment and mobility. Among the mobility theories relating to higher education, theories analyzing inequalities are studied, to discover whether they are found in Hungarian higher education (Maximally Maintained Inequality, MMI and the theory of Effectively Maintained Inequality, EMI) The analysis also covers the dynastic effects related to mobility, whether they strengthen or weaken intergenerational processes. The database of the analysis is the Graduate Career Tracking System 2010-2021.",

We document substantial segregation into occupations by parental income. Yet, the occupations children pursue explain only a third of the intergenerational persistence of income. We further describe patterns of intergenerational occupational following and show they vary substantially across occupations, with low-paying occupations showing more persistence across generations on average. However, clustering into occupations based on parental income is mostly independent of parental occupations. Our results demonstrate that occupational persistence only weakly contributes to income immobility.",

We use income intergenerational persistence to evaluate income mobility and find that migrants prefer cities with higher income mobility. We further use the instrumental variable estimation and a set of robustness tests to verify the reliability of our findings. The influence is larger among women, the elderly, and the lesseducated, while the economic prosperity of destinations could relatively offset the negative effect of lower income mobility on migration. Additionally, higher mobility not only attracts but also retains migrants, hence benefiting the local economy. Through further exploration, we find that the real migration influencing factor underlying the higher income mobility is the higher job mobility, indicating that the real pursuit of Chinese migrants is the increased access to suitable job opportunities.",
    "795": "A vast literature has examined how perceptions of mobility shape demand for redistribution. These studies generally refer to contemporaneous tax policies demanded by those directly impacted. But social mobility is often measured as changes across generations. To account for these intergenerational effects, our analysis focuses on educational policies. We examine how social mobility at the district level explains legislative support for inclusive education policies. We first develop an electoral competition model where voters are altruistic parents, politicians are office seeking and the future economic status of the children is affected both by the degree of income mobility and by public education policies. We then analyze a newly compiled dataset of roll-call votes on California education legislation matched with electoral district levels of income mobility. In line with the model, our analysis suggests that upward mobility in a district negatively predicts legislative support for redistributive education bills.",

Yet, research on trends in intergenerational income mobility finds conflicting results. To better understand this variation, we adopt a multiverse approach that estimates trends over 82,944 different definitions of income mobility, varying how and for whom income is measured. Our analysis draws on comprehensive register data for Swedish cohorts born 1958 to 1977 and their parents. We find that income mobility has declined, but for reasons neglected by previous research: improved gender equality in the labor market raises intergenerational persistence in womens earnings and the household incomes of both men and women. Dominant theories that focus on childhood investments have blinded researchers to this development. Methodologically, we show how multiverse analysis can be used with abductioninference to the best explanationto improve theory-building in social science.",
    "797": "Individuals make comparisons with their parents which determine their intergenerational mobility perceptions, yet very little is known about the areas used for intergenerational comparison and whether these matter for individuals' well-being. In 2021 we commissioned a nationally representative survey in Georgia in which we explicitly asked 1159 individuals an open-ended question on the most important areas in their intergenerational comparisons. More than 170 types of answers were provided by respondents and many of these responses went beyond the standard indicators of intergenerational mobility. We show that the areas of intergenerational comparison significantly differ between those who perceive themselves as being downwardly and upwardly mobile or immobile using the measure of mobility previously validated in cross-national research. Using, among other statistical approaches, treatment effects estimators, we demonstrate that some areas of intergenerational comparison, particularly in terms of income attainment, are significantly and consistently associated with internationally validated measures of well-being.",

We study intergenerational income rank mobility among entrepreneurs and employees in Sweden using high-quality measures of lifetime income for 215,000 father-son pairs. Incorporated entrepreneurs are more upwardly mobile than wage earners; this result is driven by high ability individuals' selection into incorporation. Unincorporated entrepreneurs are more downwardly mobile, which can be explained by negative selection, income underreporting, and lower returns to skills and education.",
    "799": "This paper aims to address the role of education in Indonesias intergenerational income mobility. This will include measuring the level of intergenerational mobility to establish the general condition in Indonesia through the estimation of intergenerational income mobility. The main data used to test the model will be secondary data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey in 1993, 1997, 2000, 2007 and 2014. Through multiple linear regression analysis, the authors conclude that education influences the levels of intergenerational income mobility in Indonesia. Childs education has a larger coefficient than fathers education in determining the childs income. Public policy must focus on human investment to develop human capital through a provision of quality education throughout the country, particularly for people from lower income groups. Indonesias government should also allocate its education spending to increase the attainment of higher education level, establishing the next generations with higher productivity and income than previous generations.",

The elasticities of sons income with respect to fathers income are separately estimated for sons who are firstborn and sons who are later born by family size using a twosample, twostage least squares approach. For sons born in 19261981, this study finds that in families with four or more children, intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) for firstborn sons is substantially and significantly higher than that for laterborn sons.

    "801": "Intergenerational social mobility studies have largely explored the relationship between one aspect of parent background (e.g. education, income, occupational status, wealth, or neighborhood context) and the corresponding aspect of that parent's child once they reach adulthood. Studies examining these various measures have provided differing conclusions about the extent that social origins constrain attainment in the U.S. In contrast, the persistence of racial inequality in intergenerational mobility is one consistent finding. For instance, across various measures, research demonstrates Black individuals are more likely than White individuals to experience downward mobility, and less likely to exceed the socioeconomic standings of their parents. In this article, we argue that a more holistic measure of both origin and destination, one that combines the abovementioned indicators, is necessary to advance our understanding of the extent that origin constrains future attainment. We summarize lessons gleaned from onedimensional estimates, and from other approaches that either combine some dimensions of socioeconomic background or attempt to capture a more holistic background in other ways. We then make a recommendation for methodological interventions to accomplish this more holistic approach and conclude with research and policy implications.",
    "802": "This article presents a novel explanation why demand for redistribution on average does not respond to information on low intergenerational mobility. Building on insights from behavioral economics, we expect that incentives to update perceptions of intergenerational mobility change along the income distribution. Empirically, we conduct a survey experiment in Austria and show that the average treatment effect of information on perceptions is mostly driven by higher income individuals while low-income respondents hardly react. We replicate this result for the United States and Germany using data from two closely related survey experiments (Alesina, Stantcheva, and ; Fehr, Mller, and ) Thus, the frequently observed unresponsiveness of demand for redistribution may result because the group which drives the effect on beliefs does not increase demand for redistribution and may even decrease it. Indeed, despite the strong perception shift in the high-income group, the treatment effects on its preferences are mostly zero and even negative for certain policies. At the same time, the group with the clearest incentives to change its redistributive preferences, the low-income group, is systematically less inclined to update its perceptions and thus their redistributive preferences are mostly unaffected and only partially increased in response to the treatment. We suggest that different responses to information could be due to motivated beliefs, since high social mobility implies for low-income earners that effort is more likely to pay off.",

Our findings reveal an intergenerational earnings elasticity of 0.51 between fathers and sons and 1 between fathers and daughters. This gender disparity stems from historically low female labor force participation and self-selection of women into employment in Turkey. Our estimates for household income elasticity for both sons and daughters are similar, at around 0.8. We also observe a slight decrease in intergenerational mobility for more recent birth cohorts, consistent with trends in other countries. Our further analysis using rank-rank slopes and transition matrices indicates weak intergenerational rank mobility and strong persistence at both ends of the income distribution in Turkey.",
    "804": "Social mobility is a process of change or movement of a person or a group, from one position to another, in society either within the generation itself (intrageneration) or between generations (intergeneration) towards a better position than before or vice versa. This article attempts to evaluate the social mobility that occurs among the first and second generations of land development settlers. The study involves two states namely Pahang and Johor with a total of 742 respondents consisting of the settlers. The sample was selected based on the group and the purposive sampling method. The findings of the study show that there is a process of social mobility that occurs in terms of the level of education, employment, and income among the first and second generations settlers. The education level of the intergenerational group was found to be vertical social mobility. These changes have also resulted in better second-generation jobs and monthly income. This study contributes to the corpus of sociology on social mobility in society. The success of intragenerational vertical social mobility shows that the development programs implemented by the government change the socio-economic status and increase the income of the settlers which further increases the level of development of the Malaysian economy.",
    "805": "The literature on intergenerational income mobility uses a diverse set of measures and there is limited knowledge about whether these measures provide similar information and yield similar conclusions. We provide a framework to highlight the key concepts and properties of the different estimators. We then show how these measures relate to one another empirically. Our main analysis uses income tax data from Australia to produce a comprehensive set of empirical estimates for each of 19 different mobility measures at both the national and regional levels. We supplement this analysis with other data that uses either within- or between-country variation in mobility measures. A key finding is that there is a clear distinction between relative and absolute measures both conceptually and empirically. A region may be high with respect to absolute mobility but could be low with respect to relative mobility. However, within broad categories, the different mobility measures tend to be highly correlated. For rank-based estimators, we highlight the importance of how the choice of the distribution used for calculating ranks can play a critical role in determining its properties as well as affect empirical findings. These patterns of results are important for policymakers whose local economy might fare well according to some mobility indicators but not others. (JEL D31, H24, I32, J62)",

Our results suggest France is characterized by a strong persistence relative to other developed countries. 9.7% of children born to parents in the bottom 20% reach the top 20% in adulthood, four times less than children from the top 20% We uncover substantial spatial variations in intergenerational mobility across departments, and a positive relationship between geographic mobility and intergenerational upward mobility.

Understanding whether and separately the rate at which individuals accumulate particular types of wealth by family background is important for improving wealth and social mobility. We show offspring wealth inequality is driven by housing wealth, and holding such wealth is becoming increasingly associated with early life circumstances relating to parental housing tenure and education, even after controlling for adult offsprings own characteristics. Importantly, we find adult offspring whose parents hold a degree and are homeowners are no less likely to report homeownership and housing wealth compared to older cohorts from the same background. Our findings infer the intergenerational rank correlation in housing wealth is set to double in approximately three decades.",
    "808": "We document that children growing up in places left behind by todays economy experience lower levels of social mobility as adults. Using a longitudinal database that tracks over 20,000 places in the USA from 1980 to 2018, we identify two kinds of left behind places: the long-term left behind that have struggled over long periods of history; and recently left-behind places where conditions have deteriorated. Compared to children of similar baseline household income levels, we find that exposure to left behind places is associated with a 4-percentile reduction in adult income rank. Children fare considerably better when exposed to places where conditions are improving. These outcomes vary across prominent social and spatial categories and are compounded when nearby places are also experiencing hardship. Based on these findings, we argue that left behind places are having scarring effects on children that could manifest long into the future, exacerbating the intergenerational challenges faced by low-income households and communities. Improvements in local economic conditions and outmigration to more prosperous places are, therefore, unlikely to be full remedies for the problems created by left behind places.",

This result appears to stem from large banks comparative disadvantage using soft information, which is particularly important for lending to low-income households. In contrast, the size of local banks has little or no effect on high-income households. Consistent with low-income parents credit constraints limiting investment in their childrens human capital, areas with larger banks exhibit a greater sensitivity of educational attainment to parental income, and less intergenerational economic mobility.",
    "810": "A large literature shows that the children of immigrants have high upward mobility. However, immigrants vary vastly in how they are selected: while economic immigrants are chosen based on skill and education, refugees migrate at times of conflict and war. In this paper, we study on the mobility of immigrants by admission class. Using administrative data linking the universe of immigrant landing documents with tax records in Canada, we estimate intergenerational mobility outcomes by refugee status. We find that for immigrant parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, refugee children have an expected rank of 47 percentiles, while the corresponding estimate for non-refugee children is 51 percentiles. Approximately 60% of this gap can be explained by differences in parental attributes upon arrival, indicating that selection contributes to higher mobility. Finally, we show that when correcting for the underplacement of immigrant parents, the absolute upward mobility of refugees at p25 is largely unaffected while that of non-refugees falls by around 2 percentiles.",
    "811": "Background Income inequality and its relationship with health has been extensively studied. Intergenerational income mobility (IGIM) has received less attention, but may be an important independent mechanism explaining health inequalities. Methods We conducted ecological analyses of the effects of IGIM and income inequality on mortality across commuting zones (CZ) in the US. IGIM was measured using rank-rank slope, i.e. the correlation between household income rank at age 15-19 and own income rank at age 29-30. We used CZ-level IGIM data from the Opportunity Insights project, Gini index of inequality from the American Community Survey, and mortality rates from CDC WONDER. Cross-sectional and longitudinal (CZ fixed effects) regression models were fitted adjusting for mean income and weighted by population. Results CZs with higher IGIM between 1995-2001 and 2011-12 had lower age-standardised mortality in 2009-2013, with 53.9 (95% CI: 48.9-58.9) fewer deaths per 100,000 for a standard deviation (SD) increase in IGIM (adjusting for mean income and Gini index in 2009-2013) This equates to 778 (773-783) deaths at the lower quartile vs. 710 (705-715) at the upper. Income inequality had a negligible association at 1.1 (-5.0, 7.3) deaths per SD increase. Longitudinal analysis across three 5-year periods confirmed that within-CZ changes in infant mortality were predicted by changes in IGIM (32.0 [12.7-51.2] fewer deaths per SD increase) but not income inequality (4.5 [-12.0, 20.9] deaths per SD increase) Conclusions Preliminary evidence suggests IGIM is a more important indicator for population health than income inequality. European researchers and public health bodies should further research and monitor IGIM, which may require improved availability of intergenerationally linked income data. Policy measures that improve social mobility, such as education and early-years interventions, may have greater health effects than policies only aiming at resource redistribution. Key messages Differences in intergenerational income mobility accounted for substantial differences in mortality across US commuting zones, while income inequality appeared relatively unimportant. European policymakers should put greater emphasis on social mobility as an economic determinant of health, and facilitate research using intergenerationally linked income data.",
    "812": "The inquiry that has culminated in this thesis was inspired by the challenges that many young Chinese people were facing when trying to gain access to affordable housing at the time of study, the early 2010s. By then, more than thirty years of housing reforms had completely changed how housing was being provided in China. The resulting structure had led young people to access housing in ways that were very different from those of their parents generation (Deng, Hoekstra &amp; ) These observations prompted the following research question: What are the key factors defining young peoples opportunity to access housing, and how do these factors relate to Chinas institutional changes during and after the market reform? The ensuing research has demonstrated that parental resources and intergenerational reciprocity are indispensable to the housing opportunity of young people, as home ownership has come to mediate the exchange of resources between generations. The marketization of the housing system which dates back to 1978 and was ongoing at the time of study, was one of many institutional changes. In the housing domain, it entailed a drastic shift in tenure. The socialist system, which had been dominated by public renting (72% in 1978) was replaced by a system in which home ownership predominated (75% in 2011) That tenure shift could only be accomplished through reforms in other domains. Reforms in the fields of finance, land use, urban planning, and even in the Constitution created a free market for developing and purchasing owner-occupied housing. In this study I have discerned four periods in Chinas housing policy. These align with the main housing tenure(s) being provided: the welfare period (danwei public rental housing, 1949-1978); the dual period (subsidized and commercial home ownership, 1978-1998); the market period (commercial home ownership, 1999-2011); and the comprehensive period (commercial home ownership and public rental housing, after 2011) Each tenure has its own allocation procedures and particular criteria for deciding which applicants are most eligible and deserving. Thus, there were different mechanisms in each period for deciding which segment of the population would get better housing than the rest. Meanwhile, the structure of housing opportunity kept changing in the course of the reform. During the welfare period, people who were employed by powerful workunits and were loyal to the regime had better opportunities, since dwellings were allocated through a bureaucratic process that did not take the occupants income into account. During the market period, over 90% of the new housing provision was commercial home ownership. Therefore, I had expected the housing opportunities available to young Chinese people to show some attributes of a market economy: the higher ones income, the better ones housing. After the policy and literature review as the first step of my research, I introduced the market transition theory in the second step () I wanted to know whether housing opportunity in post-reform China actually did show the attributes of a market economy, measured by the significance of education, employment status, and income variables as predictors of home ownership ( Deng, Hoekstra &amp; ) This hypothesis was tested on data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2010 with a logistic regression model. Some of the explanatory variables referred to the position of young people and their parents in the socialist redistributive system (such as membership of the Chinese Communist Party, work units, and hukou) while others were indicative of the young peoples economic capacity (education, employment status, and income) According to the statistical modeling exercise, young peoples economic capacity was an insignificant variable for predicting their opportunity to access homeownership. Instead, the exercise demonstrated the relevance of two redistributive variables: Communist Party membership of their parents; and locality (local or non-local) of the hukou (which was automatically inherited from ones mother but could be changed) People often needed a local urban hukou to enjoy the welfare amenities provided by municipal governments. The farther away ones hukou was registered (and thus the longer the distance migrated) the less likely one was to become a homeowner. Given the crucial parental role that came to light in the second step, I then investigated how parents influenced young peoples housing opportunity and why. For that third step I turned to the two theories of trade-offs (; ) in the organization of societal institutions (the one between homeownership and the welfare state, the other between the welfare state and intergenerational exchange) The goal was to explore how housing, welfare, family, and gender interact in a particular context, namely post-reform China. By interviewing young adults and senior parents in Chongqing, I sought to understand the experience, perception, and rationale of intergenerational transfer for home ownership. The empirical evidence suggested that when the provision of public welfare was limited, senior parents were motivated to help arrange adult childrens homeownership in exchange for support, specifically for care in old age. This interpretation was substantiated by the divergent patterns of perception and behavior regarding intergenerational transfer for home ownership that were found between parents with either an urban or a rural background. Consistent with Chinas dual welfare system, senior parents who lived in the countryside or had a background of rural-urban migration were found to have less pension and fewer other benefits than urbanites. As a result, the non-urban parents tended to view intergenerational transfer for childrens homeownership as either their responsibility or a strategy to secure support in old age. In contrast, urban parents tended to view it as an act of parental love; consequently, the return they expected was merely emotional. The young recipients tended to acknowledge the implications of reciprocity, so they took upon themselves the obligation to return the favor. The feeling of indebtedness and the commitment to reciprocate were stronger among those who had received help from their rural parents, whose transfer often involved all of their wealth. When rural seniors with no pension transferred all their savings to a child, they would subsequently move into the childs household; the latter assumed the limitless obligation to support them. Conversely, when urban parents transferred all their savings to a child, the latter did not assume that limitless obligation, since the parents would have a pension income in the future. As intergenerational transfer was seen to play an important role in young peoples housing opportunity and in elderly peoples care strategy, a closely related variable came into view: gender. Before the socialist system of welfare and housing was developed, the provision and inheritance of residential property was linked to customs regarding elderly care and ancestor worship, so property transfers were likewise carried out patrilineally. Accordingly, the parents of the bridegroom were presumed to accept the responsibility to provide housing for the newlyweds, transferring the property rights inter vivos or as a bequest. Furthermore, the bride was presumed to become a member of the bridegrooms family and thus to care for his parents until death. These patrilineal patterns were somewhat counterbalanced by the socialist regime, as the state predominated in allocating housing resources. But when the private owner-occupation housing market was established after the reform, an old custom was resurrected: parents stepping up to help young people acquire housing. But this custom affected young men differently than young women. In multi-child families, parents made the preparations and eventually transferred their assets to their sons prior to or at the moment of marriage but provided no help, or at best offered interest-free loans, to daughters upon request. In single-child families, parents would not prepare an asset transfer for their daughters. They expected their daughters future husband and his family to provide for her unless their daughters future marriage partner choice proved incapable of doing so and the daughter requested some help. In a sense, women were in a privileged position: they were able to access housing services through marriage. By the same token, however, they were disadvantaged: women did not have equal opportunity to hold housing property rights and to thereby accumulate housing assets. The position of the women I interviewed for my research was quite diverse. Some, like an urban single child with good earning power and an intergenerational transfer, had attained independent home ownership. Some women owned their home together with their husbands. And some, like those with a rural immigrant background, were living in a rental dwelling or in a home owned by the husband. The empirical evidence supports the hypothesis I formulated when starting my research: that home ownership, the welfare state, and family and gender relationships are interconnected. I used the concept of social coordination to capture the interaction of the housing, welfare, family, and gender systems. According to the social coordination framework, when the housing system of a society is dominated by home ownership, this society might have the features of a limited welfare state, could engage in extensive intergenerational transfer, and could show a clear gender division. This framework has contributed to the theorization of intergenerational transfer for home ownership. In that light, homeownership-based welfare (Doling &amp; ; Ronald &amp; ; Elsinga &amp; ) can be understood from an intergenerational perspective. The social coordination framework is also a promising basis for further research on the relationship between housing systems and the wider social structure ( 2001) What, then, were the structural features of housing opportunity for young Chinese people in post-reform China? Indeed, the development of a housing market and the massive supply of commercial housing gave some of them the opportunity to enjoy better housing conditions and even own property at an earlier stage of life compared to senior generations. However, by the second decade of the twenty-first century, their housing opportunity did not correspond to the status they had achieved in the market economy. One contribution of my research may be to bring a housing perspective into the debate about how the transition from state socialism to a market economy changes the structure of incentive opportunity. Unlike the kind of housing opportunity research that considers the whole urban population, research with a narrower focus -- on young adults from both urban and rural backgrounds during the 2010s -- suggests a much more limited effect of the market allocation of housing. Moreover, as I have pointed out, the current structure of housing opportunity was a result of the policy bias in favour of home ownership () On that basis, I have argued that housing opportunity can be improved by adapting the current housing policy to develop a healthy rental market and by creating a tenure-neutral housing system in the future.",
    "813": "Objective Physical attractiveness is often studied in relation to various life outcomes, but there is a lack of research on its links to intergenerational educational, occupational, and income mobility. Individuals may use physical attractiveness as one of the channels for experiencing upward or avoiding downward social mobility. Methods Using data about 11,583 individuals from the United States National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we contribute to the existing scholarship by investigating if physical attractiveness, assessed when individuals are around 15 years old, is an important predictor of intergenerational social mobility measured after 20 years. Results We find that physical attractiveness matters both for males and females intergenerational social mobility outcomes, but it is more important for males, even when childhood characteristics, such as various aspects of parental socioeconomic position, individuals health, a proxy for IQ, neighborhood conditions, and interviewers fixed effects, are accounted for using imputed data for observations with missing information. Across three measures of social mobilityeducation, occupation, and incomephysically attractive males are more likely to be socially mobile than males of average attractiveness. Conclusion Physical attractiveness is an independent predictor of intergenerational social mobility outcomes regarding individuals educational, occupational, and income attainment.",
    "814": "Individuals who have congenital conditions or become disabled early in life tend to have poorer educational and occupational outcomes than non-disabled individuals. Disability is known to be a complex entity with multiple causations, involving, inter alia, physiological, social, economic, and cultural factors. It is established that social factors can influence educational and occupational attainment for disabled people, and current disability policy in many countries, particularly in the Global North, stress the importance of equality of opportunity. However, there is a scarcity of research that explores the specific degrees to which advanced welfare states contribute to the equalization of life chances for individuals with early-life impairments and chronic health conditions. In this study, we use a Norwegian sample of high-quality register data on individuals with vision loss, hearing loss, physical impairment, type 1 diabetes, asthma, and Down syndrome diagnosed early in life and compare their intergenerational income mobility trajectories with a random sample drawn from the country's entire population. We find that individuals' early-life diagnoses are linked to significantly worse income outcomes in adulthood than what is observed among the general population. We conclude that even in one of the most advanced egalitarian welfare states, such as Norway, much remains to be done to equalize life chances for individuals with early-life impairments and chronic health conditions.",

We show that children whose parents were in the bottom income quintile have become less likely to exit the bottom quintile once in adulthood and less likely to transition into the middle class. Declining mobility is observed both at the national and provincial level. While federal and provincial policymakers should worry about the rise in the strength of the poverty trap, the impact of recent policy developments on children that have yet to become adults remains to be documented.",

The purpose of the study is to examine the capabilities of taxes in smoothing the wealth inequality of Russians and strengthening the intergenerational mobility in the framework of assessing their relationship on the basis of the World Bank database. According to the results of the analysis, there was a decrease in the mobility between generations in Russia and emergence of the problem of consolidating the economic situation within family, which, if the present trends continue, will be intensifying. For generations born in the 1970s and 1980s, there was recorded a sharp increase in the relative indicator of immobility the correlation coefficient between the duration of education of children and their parents, from 0.32 to 0.48. There is observed a decrease in the absolute indicators of mobility between generations a decrease in the share of children who got a longer or higher education than their parents. The Great Gatsby Curve has been transformed in the coordinates of the concentration coefficient of net personal wealth and relative intergenerational mobility in education. Russias position on the Great Gatsby Curve indicates aggravation of two related problems consolidation of inequality and reduction of mobility between generations. To level the economic inequality in Russia, it is necessary to increase vertical mobility between generations. One of the traditional and effective ways of the state regulation of the polarization of personal assets and property of citizens is tax regulation. Today in Russia, property taxes do not help to smooth out the inequality. Personal income tax on donations and property taxes of citizens make in total about 1% of the tax revenues of the consolidated budget. Concentration of wealth in 10% of the most affluent Russians exceeded 74% in 2021. Progressive taxation of personal property, increased rates for owners of many real estate objects, luxury tax, inheritance and gift tax, as well as capital taxation have prospects from the standpoint of smoothing wealth inequality and activating intergenerational mobility in Russia.",
    "818": "The authors present results from a new data set that has been assembled from tax and other administrative sources to provide evidence on economic mobility and persistence in the United States. This data set allows the authors to take on the methodological problems that have complicated previous efforts to estimate intergenerational income elasticities. The resulting estimates of intergenerational persistence are as high as all but the highest of the previously reported survey-based estimates. Because the intergenerational curves are especially steep within the parental-income region defined by the 50th90th percentiles, approximately two-thirds of the inequality between poor and well-off families is passed on to the next generation. This extreme persistence cannot be attributed to any single factor. Instead, the United States is exceptional with respect to virtually all factors governing intergenerational persistence, including the returns to human capital, the amount of public investment in the human capital of low-income children, the amount of socioeconomic segregation, and the progressiveness of the tax-and-transfer system. It follows that any substantial increase in mobility will require a wide-ranging package of reforms that cut across many institutions.",

We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Understanding Society relative to other datasets, and document patterns of attrition as individuals transition from childhood to adulthood. We then use Understanding Society to document the intergenerational persistence of wealth in the UK. We find that the intergenerational persistence of wealth is greater than for earnings, and that only around half of the intergenerational persistence of wealth can be explained by the intergenerational persistence in earnings and education.",

I apply a recently introduced econometric framework that allows for self selection and treatment effect heterogeneity. I also examine the influence of cognitive and noncognitive ability on college choice and the returns to college.Essays two through four concern different aspects of intergenerational income mobility. In the second essay, we study the impact on mobility estimates from heterogeneous income profiles and, more specifically, life-cycle bias. We use nearly career-long income measures for both fathers and sons to give a detailed account of this bias and assess recent methods to deal with it.In the third essay, we present a simple model of intergenerational transmission and use it to analyze the dynamic behavior of the intergenerational income elasticity following structural changes. We find that past structural frameworks, for example in the form of past policies or institutions, matter for current trends in mobility.The fourth essay provides a cross-country perspective on intergenerational income mobility. We construct comparable data sets for Sweden and the UK and account for country differences in the role of parental income for various productivity traits of children. Finally, we examine whether such differences can explain the country difference in intergenerational income mobility.",

This study investigates opportunity inequality in Korean society by analyzing the relationship between the income of the parents' generation and the children's generation, called as intergenerational income mobility, using the income quintile of parents and children of NHIS data. In addition to the parental effect, income mobility can also be influenced by children's characteristics and the regional characteristics of their living environment, so we aim to examine the extent to which these factors affect income mobility. The analysis shows that there is a significant relationship between parents' income levels and children's income levels, and that there are differences in mobility across regions. The analysis also shows that the effect of factors influencing children's income varies across regions. Finally, we found that when discussing inequality of opportunity and intergenerational income mobility in Korea, it is important to properly consider the characteristics of the data and the impact of relevant factors, such as the proposed measure of income mobility.",

In recent decades, this pillar of economic opportunity has eroded substantially. Though much has been written about the decline of manufacturing sectors in United States communities, the potential consequences for economic mobility, and stratification processes more generally, remain largely unexplored. In this study, I develop a conceptual framework linking the study of labor market change to economic stratification. I examine how structural changes to United States labor markets have altered opportunities for economic advancement in the United States. I focus the analysis on birth cohorts in the 1980s, whose labor market entry spans the large-scale erosion of the manufacturing industry in the 2000s. I find strong evidence that declines in manufacturing employment have contributed to growing geographic disparities in upward intergenerational income mobility. Children raised in counties that experienced large contractions in manufacturing industries throughout adolescence experienced large economic penalties in adulthood via reduced levels of upward mobility. The results demonstrate how long-term macroeconomic changes can disrupt and redistribute opportunities within societies.",

We find that Florentine society was more mobile than one would expect but also that multigenerational mobility was lower than implied by two-generation estimates. We reconcile these findings by showing their consistency with a model where wealth transmission is governed by an unobserved latent factor. We also show that, given our estimates, this model is compatible with the long run persistence obtained by previous studies. Finally, we find that participation in marriage networks and politics correlates with persistence of economic status across generations. (JEL D31, G51, J12, J62, N33)",
    "824": "We combine the Decennial Census, credit reports, and administrative earnings to create the first panel dataset linking parents credit access to the labor market outcomes of children in the U.S. We find that a 10% increase in parents unused revolving credit during their childrens adolescence (13 to 18 years old) is associated with 0.28% to 0.37% greater labor earnings of their children during early adulthood (25 to 30 years old) Using these empirical elasticities, we estimate a dynastic, defaultable debt model to examine how the democratization of credit since the 1970s modeled as both greater credit limits and more lenient bankruptcy affected intergenerational mobility. Surprisingly, we find that the democratization of credit led to less intergenerational mobility and greater inequality. Two offsetting forces underlie this result: (1) greater credit limits raise mobility by facilitating borrowing and investment among low-income households; (2) however, more lenient bankruptcy policy lowers mobility since low-income households dissave, hit their constraints more often, and reduce investments in their children. Quantitatively, the democratization of credit is dominated by more lenient bankruptcy policy and so mobility declines between the 1970s and 2000s.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

The paper analyzes the impact of intergenerational income mobility on residents marginal propensity to consume and consumption altruism motive by expanding the Over Lapping Generation Models and combining the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data. The results of the study show: Intergenerational Income Elasticity has a significant positive effect on residents marginal propensity to consume. When Intergenerational Income Elasticity increases, the \"altruistic motive\" of residents consumption will also increase significantly. Compared with rural residents, Intergenerational Income Elasticity has a stronger positive effect on urban residents marginal propensity to consume and marginal propensity to consume education. With the effect of intergenerational factors, urban residents consumption shows stronger altruistic motives.",

By modifying the child skill formation technology to incorporate new skills during adolescence, we analyze the importance of the timing of family resources on life outcomes, educational attainment and participation in crime. Parental financial resources partially offset deficiencies in nonpecuniary inputs to children's human capital. Estimates of the intergenerational influence on child outcomes are strongly influenced by the choice of lifetime versus snapshot parental income measures. The most predictive ages of children when family resources are measured vary by the outcome analyzed.",
    "827": "We follow high school graduates through college and the labor market to study income segregation and intergenerational mobility across colleges in Brazil, a unique context where admissions are mostly determined by exam scores and public institutions are free and of high quality. We show that public college admissions are income neutral once controlling for grades, but elite public colleges are composed mostly of higher-income students, as they have higher exam scores. Intergenerational mobility rates in elite public colleges are low, but higher than in comparable private institutions. We develop a sufficient statistic approach to evaluate how policies aimed at reducing income segregation across colleges impact the future earnings of different groups. We use this general framework to evaluate affirmative action in public colleges and subsidized loans for private institutions. Both policies increased the mobility of low-income students, but subsidized loans have a larger effect. While AA increases the representation of disadvantaged students in elite schools and subsidized loans do not, the latter policy reallocates an overall larger number of students to better college tiers. All the results in the paper are based on data we make publicly available for the first time. It was constructed based on confidential records and aggregated so other colleagues could use it for their research.",

This paper aims to estimate a comprehensive database of socio-economic variables for five African countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Uganda, Malawi, and Nigeria) using imputation techniques, with the ultimate goal of approximating the degrees of intergenerational transmission and social mobility. To achieve this goal, the transition matrix methodology is used in three domains: education, occupation, and income. The results show that the domain with the highest levels of mobility, in general terms, is education, and the lowest, income. Key findings reveal significant variations in the levels of social mobility across these domains depending on the studied country, such as in income mobility with respect to parents: Ethiopia is at the top with a high percentage of individuals experiencing upward mobility, and Malawi at the bottom, with a high percentage of individuals experiencing downward mobility. Moreover, the mobility levels of individuals tend to be higher for mothers than for fathers, which implies a greater improvement when compared to the most vulnerable group, i.e. women. No very significant differences have been found in the levels of mobility between baron sons and women.",

    "831": "The current trends of the development of the world economy are characterized by deepening inequality and the indicators of income, especially wealth distribution among different groups of the population witness about it. Deepening income inequality causes low level of social mobility. The latter assumes that the social status of an individual at different stages of life depends mostly on such factors as parents' educational level, profession, income rather than his own behavior. The paper has studied social mobility in OECD countries by social mobility integral index and different indicators. It should be noted that social mobility is limited by \"sticky floors\" and \"sticky ceilings\" The experience of OECD countries shows that the social status of households has a decisive role in children's employment, health and educational opportunities. Therefore, it is getting vital to provide those opportunities for human development and prevent the further deepening of inequality.",

    "834": "The concept of intergenerational mobility refers to the association between parents' and their children's socio-economic well-being. As an interest and policy area, understanding the three aspects of intergenerational transmission stands out, i) social welfare ii) equality of opportunity, and iii) economic efficiency. First, it is essential to know how resources are allocated across generations because this allocation process may influence overall social welfare defined over the entire income distribution of different generations. Secondly, intergenerational mobility may be seen as a measure of equality of opportunity. Moreover, it can be one of the ways to reduce socioeconomic inequality by promoting social justice and achieving a more equitable allocation of resources (D') Although the studies of intergenerational transmission go back to the mid-19th century () it has been started to analyze and interpreted, more recently. From the 1960s, some empirical studies on economic, social and political determinants of mobility mostly in developed countries, such as the UK, USA, Canada and Sweden ( 2002; ; ; ) are published, but for developing countries there are few works mostly due to data constraints and structural problems such as informal and household-based economic activities ( 2020; ) In this direction, this study aims to contribute scarce literature on intergenerational mobility in Turkey by using the Adult Education Survey (AES) provided by TURKSTAT. Our results indicate a strong relationship between the socioeconomic status of the family and the socioeconomic status of the child, albeit decreasing over the birth cohorts. In addition to these results, persistence in terms of intergenerational mobility is higher for females with respect to males.",

Assortative mating does not appear to play a determining role despite strong rank correlations between own parents' and parents-in-law's household wealth.

    "837": "Classical assimilation theories hold that immigrant groups will slowly integrate economically over time over multiple generations, which implies that the (grand)children of immigrants will improve their housing market position compared to their (grand)parents and transition from rental housing to owner-occupation. This study uses unique data on the children and grandchildren of immigrants and native Dutch (third generation) in 2018 to assess whether and how the descendants of large immigrant groups from the postwar era have attained ownership. The generational perspective is two-fold. First, we are interested in how individuals from various generations compare within and between origin groups (generational comparison) Second, the study also assesses the role of parental wealth and tenure in intergenerational transfers, i.e. ethnic and generational differences in the effects of these parental background variables. Our estimates from logistic regression models show that Surinamese-Dutch and Turkish-Dutch see higher predicted owner-occupation rates over generations, with some Turkish-Dutch groups having higher rates than native-Dutch. The parental background variables partly predict owner-occupation rates and explain group differences, which indicates the importance of generational transfers.",
    "838": "This study analyzes the interactions between population dynamics with differential fertility the intergenerational mobility and economic development. Population dynamics with differential fertility exerts the following two effects on the economy: (i) the change in the population size of the entire economy influences the mobility through changing in the composition of workers and (ii) the decreasing/increasing transfer per child influences the mobility. A sufficient increase in the population growth increases the population size and leads to a significant decline in the transfers per child; this phenomenon contributes toward the cyclical behavior of mobility and income inequality. On the other hand, when a population growth decreases, the mobility monotonically approaches toward steady state. These results are consistent with some empirical evidence. Hence, this study demonstrates that the population dynamics with differential fertility leads to a difference in transitional dynamics of intergenerational mobility and the process of economic development.",
    "839": "Background The objectives of this study were to (a) assess the associations between early behavioral problems and intergenerational income mobility (i.e. the degree to which income status is transmitted from one generation to the next) (b) verify whether these associations are moderated by child sex, and (c) explore indirect effects of early behavioral problems on income mobility via high school graduation. Methods Data were drawn from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children ( n = 3,020; 49.17% girls) Participants were followed from age 6 to 37 years. Measures included parents' and teachers' ratings of behavioral problems at age 6 years as well as participants' (ages 3035 years) and their parents' (when participants were aged 1019 years) income data obtained from tax return records. Regression models were used to predict upward and downward mobility (i.e. increased or decreased income status from one generation to the next) from attentiondeficit/hyperactivity problems, conduct/opposition problems, depression/anxiety problems, prosociality, and the quality of children's relationship with their caregiver. Twoway interaction effects between behavioral problems and child sex were examined and indirect effect models including high school graduation as a mediator of these associations were conducted. Results Despite their higher educational attainment, females had lower incomes and experienced lower upward (but higher downward) income mobility than males. For both females and males, higher levels of attentiondeficit/hyperactivity and conduct/opposition problems were associated with decreased odds of upward mobility, whereas higher levels of attentiondeficit/hyperactivity were associated with increased odds of downward mobility. Attentiondeficit/hyperactivity problems, conduct/opposition problems as well as low prosociality were associated with lower educational attainment (no high school diploma) which in turn was associated with increased odds of downward mobility. Conclusions Results highlight the importance of providing intensive support to children with early behavioral problems as a means of improving educational attainment and intergenerational income mobility.",
    "840": "This article analyzes how property price rises have affected household assets and liabilities using household microdata. Over the past several years, households have accumulated wealth rapidly on the back of price hikes in real estate. But the pace of wealth growth has been uneven depending on the size of household wealth. High-net-worth households have accumulated wealth at a faster pace with a greater contribution of property price increases compared to household income. In Korea, high-net-worth households tend to own a larger share of their total assets in real estate. For that reason, a steep rise in property prices has a larger impact on wealthy households, thereby widening the wealth gap. In addition, the effect of property price rises on the household balance sheet has been heterogeneous across generations. Especially, financial liabilities held by households with heads aged 25-44, who have a relatively lower homeownership rate, have ballooned during the recent housing market boom.From the perspective of economic mobility, wealth mobility is lower than income mobility. Accordingly, the wealth gap which has been widened due to the property price increases is likely to persist. Furthermore, the quality and composition of financial liabilities of households with heads aged 25-44 have deteriorated. The proportion of heavily indebted households in the group has increased more sharply. And the purpose of loans taken out has varied depending on their household wealth. To be specific, the share of loans for leasehold (jeonse) or security deposits has been increasing among households in their bottom 60% net worth segment, while the share of loans for residential housing purchases has been increasing overall among households in their top 40%.It is noteworthy that households in Korea regard real estate as a primary means of wealth accumulation. In this regard, more policy attention should be paid to the distribution of wealth as well as housing stability. Also, thorough monitoring of developments and risk factors in the housing market is needed to prevent financial vulnerabilities from materializing.",

To do so, we construct a general equilibrium overlapping generations model with intergenerational linkages, a higher education choice as well as a multi-stage human capital production process during childhood and adolescence with parental and government schooling investments. The model features rich cross-sectional heterogeneity, distinguishes between single and married parents, and is disciplined by US household survey data on income, wealth, education and time use. Studying the transitions induced by unexpected policy reforms we show that the \"free college\" and the \"better schools\" reform generate significant welfare gains, which take time to materialize and are lower in general than in partial equilibrium. It is optimal to combine both reforms: tuition subsidies make college affordable even for children from poorer parental backgrounds and better schools increase human capital thereby reducing dropout risk.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

Design/methodology/approach Using the Global Database of Intergenerational Mobility (GDIM) the empirical analysis is conducted by coupling the principal components analysis with the hierarchical clustering. The variance tests verify the robustness of the clusters. Findings Income mobility is higher in those countries where there is high public investment devoted to education and high perception of rule of law to buffer the adverse effects of crime on income mobility. The redistributive policies must be oriented to better the wealth distribution and not only income equality opportunity to decrease crime and to increase income mobility. A plausible existence of hidden income mobility emerges from the linkages between income mobility and frauds. Social implications More redistributive policies for education, income and wealth equality should be applied in those countries with low income mobility and high violent crime rates; higher punishment rates should be applied to reduce the rates of thefts and frauds in high income mobility countries. Originality/value The main contribution is the identification of what type of crime leads to downward income mobility, as well as the role of perceived quality of the legal system, government and family ties in the association between income mobility and crime, suggesting also the potential existence of hidden income mobility.

    "846": "Intergenerational mobility captures the distance between the socioeconomic positions of parents versus their adult children. Researchers measure this distance in absolute and relative units, such as absolute dollars and relative ranks. Absolute and relative mobility often diverge. For example, absolute mobility can rise while relative mobility declines. How should scholars and policymakers understand this divergence? We conclude that they should understand it as follows: absolute mobility is less reflective than relative mobility of marginalized childrens socioeconomic disadvantages. We base this conclusion on analyses of survey, administrative, and simulated data on income mobility in the contemporary United States. We analyze multiple points of difference in mobility, which facilitates the recognition of several asymmetries. First, high-income childrens experiences weigh more heavily in absolute-mobility trends than low-income childrens experiences, particularly when economic growth is positive. Second, this asymmetry is more characteristic of absolute- than relative-mobility trends. Third, absolute-mobility differences across demographic groups are more prone than relative-mobility differences to obscure marginalized groups socioeconomic disadvantages. These asymmetries have policy implications: We caution that focusing on absolute mobility as a policy target can divert attention away from societys most disadvantaged children.",

    "848": "This paper measures housing inequality from two dimensions: housing quantity and living space. Using CGSS data and an ordered probit model, it empirically examines the causal relationship between housing inequality and residents' subjective social status. The research indicates that housing inequality significantly influences residents' social status perception. The greater the quantity of housing and the larger the living space, the higher the residents' subjective social status. This conclusion remains robust after conducting sensitivity tests. Mechanistic analyses show that the wealth effect is the transmission pathway through which housing inequality affects individuals' social status perceptions. Heterogeneity analyses showed that housing inequality significantly exacerbated social stratification, which was particularly evident in age. Further analysis reveals that housing assets not only have significant impacts on the present but also serve as a key factor in enhancing intergenerational mobility in the future. This study explains the drivers of residents' social status perceptions from the perspective of housing inequality, and provides empirical evidence and policy insights for China to improve the long-term mechanism of real estate, and to prevent the risk of social status perceptions divergence due to housing allocation.",
    "849": "Growing income and wealth inequality have rekindled interest in questions of social mobility versus intergenerational persistence. Specifically at the lowend of the inequality distribution, rising poverty risks amongst workingage households have raised concerns regarding laterlife consequences of childhood poverty. This paper investigates crosscountry and cohort variations in the intergenerational transmission of financial disadvantage, by pooling crosssections from EUSILC (200520112019) for 31 European countries. Similar to previous research, adolescent financial disadvantage contributes significantly to income poverty risks in adulthood. In only about half of European countries, such impacts are explained by close relationships between parental family structure and adolescent financial disadvantage, or mediated by labour marketrelated status attainment from parents to children. Next, compared with older cohorts, for younger respondents coming of age in the era of enhanced globalization and dualization since the 1990s, and during the postfinancial crisis and austerity years, a trend towards enhanced stratification of current poverty with regard to adolescent financial disadvantage emerges. Multilevel analyses based on these younger cohorts indicate that more generous active (outsider spending) and passive (social exclusion spending) welfare benefits aimed at compensating poorer households for the consequences of labour market and welfare state dualization significantly mitigate current income poverty of those who experienced financial disadvantage in adolescence. Welfare reforms implying reductions in social spending disproportionally affecting outsiderhouseholds (intended or unintended) may therefore be costly in the long run, as the intergenerational transmission of financial disadvantage might intensify.",
    "850": "Using a novel longitudinal dataset, we study the intergenerational mobility of ruralurban migrants who returned to the countryside in due course. By examining pairs of brothers during the entire migration lifecycle from childhood until age 34 we estimate the effect of temporarily relocating to an urban area on occupational income over the mature working ages of 3544 between the 1890s and the 1940s in Sweden. The results show that ruralurban migrants who returned to the countryside were not failures who did not improve their social position, but instead experienced substantial gains compared with their nonmigrant brothers. These gains were similar to those of migrants who had permanently settled in urban areas. This pattern is mainly attributed to their capacities to leave farming and enter whitecollar positions to a greater extent than nonmigrants. The extent of temporary ruralurban migration, combined with the high levels of intergenerational mobility of return migrants in Sweden during the period examined, suggests that ruralurban migration to towns resulted in positive feedback effects for the countryside.",

In order to do so, we use a quasi-natural experimental research design to investigate how a change in state level bank competition (following geographic deregulation) affects the intergenerational mobility of individuals born to (poorer) families at the lower end of the income distribution. We find that individuals born to poorer families who spend their first years as adults in an area with a more competitive banking system, experience higher mobility relative to counterparts located in areas characterised by lower levels of bank competition. Increased educational opportunities and entrepreneurship are important underlying factors driving the observed increases in intergenerational mobility.",
    "852": "Violence is a key mechanism in the reproduction of community disadvantage. The existing evidence indicates that violence in a community impacts the intergenerational mobility of its residents. The current study explores the possibility of a reverse relationship. This study provisionally tests the hypothesis that depressed intergenerational mobility in a community may also spark subsequent community violence. We deploy a county measure of intergenerational mobility captured during early adulthood for a cohort of youth born between 1980 and 1986 and raised in low-income families [R. Chetty, N. Hendren, Quart. J. Econom. 133 11631228 (2018)] We model the relationship between county mobility scores and two county-level outcomes: violent crime and homicide. We find that a countys level of intergenerational mobility as measured by the ChettyHendren data is a major predictor of its rate of violent crime and homicide in 2008, when the youth in Chettys mobility cohort were young adults (the same age the mobility measure was captured) In fact, mobility is a significantly stronger and more consistent predictor of community violent crime and homicide rates than more commonly used factors like poverty, inequality, unemployment, and law enforcement presence.",
    "853": "We estimate intergenerational wealth mobility using administrative records from Taiwan and find strong intergenerational rank correlations in household gross wealth, around 0.40 for sons and 0.30 for daughters. The wealth rank correlations are similar for single and married children, even though married children have greater household wealth and relatively strong assortative mating. The intergenerational wealth correlation is nonlinear and particularly strong for families in the top 10 % of household wealth. Different family sizes and gender compositions do not significantly affect intergenerational wealth mobility, regardless of the children's gender or marital status. Since our sample includes only parents who are still alive, these correlations are not driven by bequests. However, inter vivos transfers appear to play a significant role.",

Previous research has demonstrated that Brazil continues to be one of the least mobile countries in the world; however, the country has experienced strong socioeconomic advances in recent decades that may have affected mobility. The use of data from the 1982 birth cohort in the city of Pelotas, in the extreme south of Brazil, makes this one of the first studies to estimate mobility using direct observations of parental and filial income in Brazil. Using various estimation techniques, the results reveal relatively high income mobility compared with past Brazilian standards. Mobility is higher for nonwhites, extremely similar across genders, and higher among the poor. The findings indicate that increased government investment in education and reduced returns to education in recent decades are possible channels.",
    "855": "We investigate intergenerational income mobility across labor market regions in Norway, looking at gender differences in response to industrial diversity. Our identification strategy exploits variation in the timing of regional migration, measured over the age spans 619 and 1319 years. We make extensive use of fixed effects so that each region only affects adult outcomes, measured as income rank, through differences in exposure time. Our results reveal significantly larger exposure effects among daughters than among sons. The difference is particularly large when we contrast sons to fathers and daughters to mothers, but it is also apparent when we place sons and daughters, respectively, fathers and mothers, in the same distribution. We further find that industrial diversity, and thus the range of job opportunities, matters most during the teenage years. The patterns are, to some extent, detectible on maps, for example, with better mobility opportunities for men in coastal regions based on maritime and/or marine specialization. We conclude with assessments, a recommendation for regional policy, and some international considerations.",

We obtain variable importance plots and analyze the relationships between mobility and its predictors through Shapley values. Results show that intergenerational income mobility is expected to be positively predicted by the parental average education, the share of married individuals and negatively predicted by the share of children that have completed less than primary education, the growth rate of population density, and inequality. Mobility in education is expected to have a positive relationship with the adult literacy, government expenditures on primary education, and the stock of migrants. The unemployment and poverty rates matter for income mobility, although the direction of their relationship is not clear. The same occurs for education mobility and the growth rate of real GDP per capita the degree of urbanization, the share of female population, and income mobility. Income mobility is found to be greater for the 1960s cohort. Countries belonging to the Latin America and Caribbean region present lower mobility in income and education. We find a positive relationship between predicted income mobility and observed mobility in education.",
    "857": "Background: Our goal in this report was to quantify the degree to which opioid prescription rates and socioeconomic correlates of income inequality predicted overdose deaths in the 1055 U.S. Midwest counties. The study follows up a state-level analysis which reported that opioid prescription rates, social capital and unemployment explained much of the variance in opioid overdose death rates (Heyman, McVicar, & ) Methods: We created a data set that included drug overdose death rates, opioid prescription rates, and correlates of income inequality. Given that the variables of interest varied at the state and county level, multilevel regression was our statistical approach. Results: From 2006 to 2021, Midwest overdose drug deaths increased according to an exponential equation that closely approximated the equation that describes the increases in overdose deaths for the entire U.S. from 1978 to 2016 (e.g. Jalal et al. 2018) Retail opioid prescription sales increased from 2006 to 2012, but then declined so that by 2017 they were lower than in 2006. The regression analyses revealed that intergenerational income mobility was the strongest predictor of overdose deaths. The other consistently statistically significant predictors were opioid prescription rates, social capital, and unemployment rates. Together these predictors, plus pupil teacher ratios, single parent families, and attending college accounted for approximately 47 % of the variance in overdose death rates each year. In keeping with the decline in opioid prescription rates, the explanatory power of opioid prescription rates weakened over the course of the study. Conclusions: Overdose deaths increased at a constant exponential rate for the years that it was possible to apply our regression model. This occurred even though access to legal opioids decreased. What remained invariant was the predictive strength of intergenerational income mobility; each year it was the predictor that explained the most variance in overdose deaths.",
    "858": "The study of intergenerational income mobility has witnessed more visibility in academic and public policy circles in light of the new estimates generated by Chetty and colleagues. The distribution of race-based estimates of intergenerational income mobility demonstrates strong spatial patterning, such that the success of a child's traversal to the top income quintile in the United States is spatially conditioned and dependent on locality. However, research drawing on the new estimates of intergenerational income mobility has largely taken an aspatial approach. This study is the first attempt to develop an explicitly spatial model, demonstrating that the determinants of place-based mobility vary both geographically and across racial groups. By systematically accounting for spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity, we identify the race- and region-specific determinants of intergenerational income mobility across counties in the United States.",
    "859": "Characteristics of sprawl, like decreased social cohesion and lower accessibility to jobs and services, could negatively affect economic opportunity and intergenerational mobility. City-level studies have found mixed results, but neighborhood effects have been largely ignored. This study uses census tract and city-level data in a multilevel model to develop a richer understanding of the scale-dependent relationship between sprawl and intergenerational mobility. The authors found that a 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in sprawl at the tract level is associated with a 0.07 SD decrease in upward economic mobility, while a 1 SD increase in city-level sprawl is associated with a 0.08 SD decrease. Sprawl negatively affects upward intergenerational mobility at the metropolitan level and the census tract level. The negative relationship of economic outcomes to sprawl does not hold for high-income children, indicating that there may be conflicting benefits for different income families. Policy makers should understand these conflicting pressures.",

Design/methodology/approach This article construct regression models to examine the relationship between filial piety concepts and wages. Also, it uses unconditional quantile regression and decomposition to explore the impact of filial piety concepts on the wage gap. Findings It is found that: (1) The effects of two-dimensional filial piety are heterogeneous in terms of gender. Specifically, authoritarian filial piety significantly suppresses individual wages and has a stronger suppressive effect on womens wages, whereas affinity filial piety significantly enhances individual wages without gender heterogeneity; (2) Parents' time support in the intergenerational exchange model is a crucial mechanism by which filial piety affects wages, exhibiting significant gender heterogeneity; (3) Regarding wage distribution, authoritarian filial piety mainly widens the gender income gap in the low and middle income-groups, while affinity filial piety narrows the gender wage gap by raising the floor, with its converging effect being most significant in the middle and high-income groups. This article deepens the understanding of the gender wage gap and intergenerational income mobility, providing policy references for better utilizing the social governance function of culture.

    "861": "We present an empirical study on the impact of digital finance development on intergenerational income mobility. Combining nationally representative Chinese household survey data with indices for digital financial inclusion (DFI) we find that the development of digital finance leads to a lower correlation between children's income and their fathers income, significantly enhancing intergenerational mobility. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the DFI index is associated with a decrease in intergenerational income elasticity by 0.040.05. The effect is particularly pronounced in rural and inland regions. Furthermore, we find that digital finance development stimulates household entrepreneurial activities, which in turn enhance the role of digital finance in reducing intergenerational income correlation.",
    "862": "Studies examining the consequences of intergenerational income mobility for individuals often face challenges due to multicollinearity between origin, destination, and a mobility construct based on the origin-destination difference. This article introduces a novel conceptualization of mobility, termed reachability mobility, which is based on the easiness of achieving a particular origin-destination combination within a population. This approach contrasts with the traditional lattice-based conceptualization. Furthermore, this study proposes using copulasa statistical tool that captures the dependence structure between incomes of two generations while remaining insensitive to their marginal distributionsto measure reachability mobility. When combined with a standard measure of mobility direction, this approach allows scholars to simultaneously estimate the effects of origin, destination, and mobility along with numerous other methodological advantages. An illustrative example is provided that investigates the effect of intergenerational income mobility on mental health status using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979.",

We construct relative, absolute, global and local measures of mobility for Portugal, comparing them with existing evidence for this and other countries. These are the intergenerational income elasticity (computed using the two-sample two-stage least squares method) income correlation, rank-rank slope, bottom to top income level probability, the share of individuals earning more than their fathers and also the intergenerational education correlation, the low to high education level probability, and the share of individuals with a higher education level than their fathers. We consider the 19681988 cohorts and the 1995 and 2019 waves of the European Community Household Panel and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, respectively. Overall, based on the point estimates, women seem to present more mobility in income. Upward income mobility is verified at the bottom while persistence exists at the top. Women present a greater absolute educational mobility. More than 80% of individuals have a higher education than their fathers and full upward education mobility exists for children of low-educated fathers. Mobility in education is higher for the offspring of mediumhigh-income fathers. Individuals with a high education level, in the mediumhigh income level or with occupations requiring a higher education level show higher mobility.",
    "864": "Purpose This paper aims to shed light on the relationship between intergenerational labor mobility and tax morale among European citizens, given the relatively limited evidence on the potential influence of tax compliance behavior on future inequalities. Design/methodology/approach Exploiting data from the European Values we show that the larger the intergenerational mobility, i.e. better economic conditions of children respect to their parents, the larger the willingness to pay taxes. In this vein, the subjective tax payment may be meant as an investment which could be rewarded with a more mobile society result by considering different estimation strategies. This evidence remarks the importance to foster intergenerational mobility to build a more tax-compliant society. Findings The linkage between mobility and tax morale is stronger and significant across citizens living in high income classes, and in countries where there is a commitment of the Government in guaranteeing more opportunities to citizens regardless of their familiar starting conditions (more defamiliarized countries) We further show that the intergenerational mobility significantly shapes the attitude towards tax payment only among individuals who claim for independence from their family context (i.e. those showing less family ties) This evidence remarks the importance to foster intergenerational mobility to build a more tax-compliant society. Originality/value We revisit the linkage between attitude toward tax compliance and inequality, on the light of the intergenerational labor mobility, that may be seen as the dependence between children's and parents' earnings. Given the insights from the existing studies, this paper represents the first empirical work that aims to analyze the potential relationship between intergenerational mobility and personal attitude toward tax payment across European citizens.",
    "865": "Intergenerational hierarchical solidification threatens the sustainable development of economies and societies in countries worldwide. In this paper, we match macro data on digital factor participation at the city level with micro data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies (CFPS) from 2010 to 2018 to explore whether digital factor participation can break hierarchical solidification and create opportunities for rags to riches on the basis of the perspective of intergenerational income mobility. We find that digital factor participation contributes to facilitating upwards income mobility between generations, alleviating intergenerational hierarchical solidification. Additionally, its marginal effects are most pronounced in the low-income groups, indicating that digital factor participation serves as a booster for poor second generations to leapfrog rather than an accelerator for wealth accumulation among the wealthy second generations. Furthermore, our research reveals that digital factor participation potentially facilitates intergenerational occupational vertical shift channels and promotes the horizontal migration of the labour force, which in turn weakens intergenerational transmission effects, promotes intergenerational income mobility, and breaks intergenerational hierarchical solidification. Our study highlights the importance of seizing the opportunities presented by digital factor participation, as such participation offers more equitable opportunities for the lower class, which is particularly concerning in the context of the intensifying global trend of social stratification.",
    "866": "This paper studies intergenerational income mobility using register data for 630,000 Danish children and their parents. We document substantial mobility differences across parents income levels. Decomposing the mobility estimates shows that for children from low-income families, intergenerational income persistence is exclusively explained by parents influence on childrens employment. As parents income increases, education becomes an increasingly dominant factor, except among children from the top-5% where intergenerational income persistence is driven by capital income likely through bequests and business contacts. Finally, we find that progressive public transfers such as those in Denmark suppress the importance of intergenerational transmission of employment. (99) JEL: I24, I30, J62",
    "867": "Families are widely recognized as crucial agents in the transmission of wealth, contributing to the perpetuation of inequality and limiting mobility across income levels. To address the economic dynamics behind this phenomenon, classical economists have explored potential solutions through government tax-transfer systems. One such proposal, advanced by Eugenio Rignano, suggests imposing higher taxes on inheritances passed down through multiple generations within a family. To analyze this idea, a model is developed that incorporates both altruistic and accidental bequests, with altruistic bequests playing a crucial role in wealth transmission. The model considers the potential disincentives that inheritance taxation might create for savings intended for altruistic bequests, as well as the benefits of taxing accidental bequests. The novelty of the model lies in its characterization of optimal inheritance taxes when there is an interaction between parents' educational decisions for their children and the transmission of wealth. Simulations suggest that adopting Rignano's proposed tax scheme enhances social welfare compared to the commonly used proportional inheritance tax. These findings suggest that Rignano's tax scheme warrants further research and policy discussion.",

Our sample is a cohort of males born between 1963 and 1982 that reached adulthood over a period spanning the policy reforms of the 1980s. We show that the IGE of income (IGE) measure of IIM is higher for men born later in the sample, suggesting that IIM has decreased over the period of rising income inequality following the reforms. To more closely examine the statistical association between income inequality and IIM, we exploit spatiotemporal variation in IGE estimates and Gini coefficients to show that growing up in regions or periods in which there is higher income inequality is associated with lower IIM. Although these results do not imply causality, they are consistent with an international literature that establishes a statistical association between income inequality and IIM.",

We document substantial segregation into occupations by parental income. Children of high-income parents are significantly more likely to pursue high-paying and more desirable occupations. Since parents may pass on their occupations to their children, we further describe patterns of intergenerational occupational following and show they vary substantially across occupations, with low-income occupations showing more persistence across generations on average. Yet, occupational persistence plays a limited role for income mobility, explaining only 10 percent of the income rank-rank relationship. (JEL J13, J16, J31, J62)",

These measures do not incorporate the rich data available in the Census. Employing machine learning techniques, we aim to develop socioeconomic status scores by leveraging a diverse array of Census variables, including occupation, industry, race, geography, housing tenure, and nativity. The scores will primarily be estimates of life span based on links to Social Security data via CenSoc. The objective of the study is to make publicly available scores that researchers can use in studies of intergenerational mobility, life course studies, and labor force composition, and to determine the most important characteristics from pre-1940 Census data that predict life span.",
    "871": "Do individuals in the upper class have siblings with similar class positions to themselves? Using data based on the entire registered population in Norway, this article describes brothers' and sisters' class destinations with particular attention to the upper class and top wealth positions. The study first describes upper-class recruitment across families of different classes, finding similarities in siblings' social mobility. Concerning upper-class reproduction, first- and secondborn siblings from families with top wealth are particularly likely to both reach upper-class positions. Second, the paper describes how upper-class members tend to have siblings with similar class positions to themselves in terms of both vertical class and horizontal positions according to individuals' composition of cultural and economic capital. By adopting a class-theoretical framework for sibling outcomes, the work sheds light on the social connectedness between social class positions that emerge through intergenerational mobility. The wealthiest 0.2% are shown to have siblings who are disproportionally often not only situated in higher class positions, but also in the economic fraction of the upper and middle classes.",
    "872": "Rank-rank regression is commonly employed in economic research as a way of capturing the relationship between two economic variables. It frequently features in studies of intergenerational mobility as the resulting coefficient, capturing the rank correlation between the variables, is easy to interpret and measures overall persistence. However, in many applications it is common practice to include other covariates to account for differences in persistence levels between groups defined by the values of these covariates. In these instances the resulting coefficients can be difficult to interpret. We propose the conditional rank-rank regression, which uses conditional ranks instead of unconditional ranks, to measure average within-group income persistence. The difference between conditional and unconditional rank-rank regression coefficients can then be interpreted as a measure of between-group persistence. We develop a flexible estimation approach using distribution regression and establish a theoretical framework for large sample inference. An empirical study on intergenerational income mobility in Switzerland demonstrates the advantages of this approach. The study reveals stronger intergenerational persistence between fathers and sons compared to fathers and daughters, with the within-group persistence explaining 62% of the overall income persistence for sons and 52% for daughters. Smaller families and those with highly educated fathers exhibit greater persistence in economic status.",
    "873": "This paper provides an overview of recent empirical and methodological advances in the study of historical intergenerational mobility trends, with a focus on key measurement challenges. These advances are made possible by the recent digitization of historical censuses and new methods of historical record-linking, which have enabled researchers to create large historical samples of parent-child links. We identify three main findings. First, absolute mobility increased in the decades leading up to 1940 but has since declined, both in the US and other industrial countries. Second, recent studies on relative mobility question the classic narrative that the US has transitioned from a \"land of opportunity\" in the 19th century to a less mobile society today, suggesting that mobility was not as high in the past. However, estimates of relative mobility are sensitive to choices regarding sample selection and measurement. Third, we explore mechanisms underlying shifts in intergenerational mobility over time, including geographic mobility, wealth shocks, educational attainment, locational effects, and the transmission of parent-specific human capital. We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

Yet beyond spending levels, the fiscal centralization of state and local governmentsthat is, the relative role of higher- versus lower-level governments in taxing, spending, and public employmentalso differs substantially, traceable to place-specific founding circumstances and path dependent historical trajectories. In this study, we ask, in more centralized fiscal systems, is there less spatial inequality in the economic mobility outcomes of low-income children? To answer this, we construct a novel Fiscal Centralization Index for each state and each county using data from the U.S. Census of Governments. We then use place-based estimates of intergenerational economic mobility, provided by Opportunity Insights, to measure cross-census-tract variation in the mobility outcomes of children within each state and each county. We find that more centralized fiscal structures exhibit less spatial inequality in the economic mobility outcomes of low-income children, and this is driven by improving outcomes in lower-performing census tracts. Our findings motivate the fiscal sociology of place as a framework for revealing how historically conditioned fiscal systems are implicated in the production of place-based inequalities, with the potential to generate new insights and policy interventions.",
    "875": "This paper presents a unified framework to analyze social mobility (SM) and inequality of opportunity (IOp) in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, focusing on subnational disparities in intermediate functional areas. Using data from the 2018 Household Survey on Territorial Dynamics and Wellbeing, we estimate SM and IOp simultaneously to investigate how individuals' origins and circumstances influence their economic outcomes as adults. The study employs rank-rank regression to measure relative SM and introduces additional variables, such as sex and territorial characteristics, to capture IOp. Our findings indicate that absolute mobility is similar across the three countries, but relative mobility is higher in Chile, while IOp is lower compared to Colombia and Mexico. Parental wealth is the most significant determinant of IOp in Mexico, whereas territorial factors play a more influential role in Chile and Colombia. The results suggest that policies aimed at reducing IOp and enhancing SM should combine place-based and person-based interventions, especially in countries where territorial characteristics significantly impact socioeconomic outcomes. This paper contributes to the literature by offering a comparative analysis of SM and IOp within a common analytical framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of the complex interactions between these two concepts.",
    "876": "Background: Intergenerational persistence is an important indicator of poverty trap which has been explored in literature using measures such as income, wealth, education, among others.Aim: This study aims at expanding the existing literature on intergenerational mobility (IGM) by going beyond conventional measures and adopting subjective wellbeing (SWB) as a more holistic measure of social stratification.Setting: The study considers the IGM of SWB in South Africa, accounting for possible endogeneity bias caused by simultaneity between parent and child SWB as well as the life-path patterns of SWB.Method: The study uses waves 1 and 5 of the National Income Dynamics Study panel data for South Africa using a range of regression specifications including fixed effects and Lewbels internal heteroscedasticity-based identification.Results: The findings indicate that while positive significant persistence exists between parent and child SWB measured at the same time point, this is much lower compared to persistence measured using income. Motherchild and co-residents record higher intergenerational persistence compared to fatherchild and non-coresidents respectively. Further, considering the life-cycle dependency of SWB, the persistence reduces considerably. Lastly, the persistence is no longer found to be positive and significant when correcting for possible endogeneity bias in the SWB association of parents and children.Conclusion: This is the first study on IGM using the measure of SWB and the substantially different findings from other income-based studies points to the value of a more holistic assessment of IGM.Contribution: Further, it is also indicative of the non-income determinants of SWB trends in South Africa.",
    "877": "Urbanization has long fueled a dual narrative: cities are heralded as sources of economic dynamism and wealth creation yet criticized for fostering inequality and a range of social challenges. This paper addresses this tension using a multidisciplinary approach, combining social sciences methods with satellite imagery-based spatial pattern analysis to study the US urban expansion over the past century. We examine the impact of physical urban spatial characteristics (size, population density, and connectedness) on equality of opportunity, measured through intergenerational mobility, as well as its association with levels of income, wealth, and social capital. Our findings confirm that contemporary cities, particularly population-dense and expansive ones, are indeed divisive forcesacting as centers for income and wealth generation but failing to deliver equal opportunities for economic mobility. Perhaps surprisingly, this polarizing dynamic is a recent phenomenon. In the past, the most urbanized regions performed well in terms of income creation and equality of opportunity. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the mid-20th century marked a pivotal shift toward more unequal and less inclusive patterns of urban growth.",

From the late 1970s to the 1990s, Gautreaux moved thousands of Black families into predominantly white neighborhoods to support racial and economic integration. We link historical program records to administrative data and use plausibly exogenous variation in neighborhood placements to study how desegregating moves impact children in the long-run. Being placed in the predominantly white neighborhoods targeted by the program significantly increases childrens future lifetime earnings and wealth. These moves also increase the likelihood of marriage and particularly raise the probability of being married to a white spouse. Moreover, placements through Gautreaux impact neighborhood choices in adulthood. Those placed in predominantly white neighborhoods during childhood live in more racially diverse areas with higher rates of upward mobility nearly 40 years later.",

Trekhsvyatitelskii Ln. 22, Russian Federation. E-mail: has been a rather long sustained tradition in comparative studies of social stratification to rely on categories and concepts introduced by Western sociologists and which are appropriate for developed and modernizing countries. This article attempts to establish whether such universalistic approaches to stratification are actually sufficient for explaining real inequalities between countries developing along different paths (as is becoming more or less obvious in the case of post-socialist development).In the earlier collaborative study with professor O. Shkaratan, we provided some theoretical and empirical justifications in favor of a particular character of social and economic differentiation in contemporary Russia. By looking at the process of structuration and the reproduction of homogenous social groups, we have established that they are more likely to resemble estates (originating from power/authority ranks) rather than classes (based on differences in the market situation) A possible explanation for this is that Russia has not given up its statist tradition in social and economic development, and that it has further shifted away from developing a Western type of capitalism. However, to claim so, we had to provide further credibility for this argument by looking at these findings from comparative perspective, i.e. we had to establish whether similar hierarchies can be observed in the neighboring (geographically, as well as historically) post-socialist countries, and whether they are less likely to dominate among the Western developed countries.Using empirical data from the European Social Survey (Round 3, 2006) I show that there is a far stronger degree of matching between individual occupation, education and income in better developed European countries than is observed among the post-socialist states. To emphasize this finding, I also look at the differences in patterns of intergenerational mobility, according to which post-socialist societies are far less mobile and meritocratic than their Western counterparts. The main theoretical argument behind this, I suggest, is the incompatibility of modern capitalistic institutions, such as private property and market, with historical and cultural contexts of development in post-socialist countries. To test this argument I developed a corresponding scale and superposed it with my empirical findings. From this point of view, Russia is regarded as one of the most unsuccessful cases of transformation, since the initial conditions of its social change were less consistent with the logic of Western modernization than in any other post-socialist European country.",

To examine how educationaffects mobility, elasticities are also estimated for children who are educated to a greater orleser extent than their parents. In addition, elasticities are decomposed to determine theproportion which is explained by the effect of parental income on childrens educationalattainment. This thesis analyses data from the 10th wave of the Household Income and Labour Dynamicsin Australia survey, covering the period from 2006 to 2010. As parental income is notreported in the survey, mothers and fathers incomes have been imputed based on theiroccupation, applying income data from the childrens generation and assuming parental agesof 40 years. The results suggest that daughters experience greater earnings mobility than sons with respectto their fathers income, while sons are more mobile than daughters with respect to theirmothers income. More highly educated sons experience greater intergenerational earningsmobility than less educated sons, particularly if they are more educated than their father.Childrens educational attainment accounts for over half the son-father, daughter-father anddaughter-mother elasticities. The explained proportion of elasticities generally increases withparental income though decreases at very high levels of parental income, suggestingmechanisms other than educational attainment have a greater role in transferring incomelevels between parents and children amongst very wealthy families.",

Revisiting this literature, my contribution in adopting the siblings approach lies in controlling for heterogeneity within the family by using pre-motherhood school performance, a characteristic that differs across sisters. My findings confirm the presumption that within-family heterogeneity can result in biased sibling estimates. Estimating Intergenerational Schooling Effects: A Comparison of Methods Recent studies that aim to estimate the causal link between the education of parents and their children provide evidence that is far from conclusive. This paper explores why. There are a number of possible explanations. One is that these studies rely on different data sources, gathered in different countries at different times. Another one is that these studies use different identification strategies. Three identification strategies are currently in use: identical twins; adoptees; and instrumental variables. In this paper we apply each of these three strategies to one particular Swedish data set, with the purpose to explain the disparate evidence in the recent literature. Our findings indicate that the estimated impact of parental education on that of their child in Sweden does depend on identification, which suggests that country and cohort differences do not lie behind the observed disparities. Intergenerational Mobility and Assortative Mating: Effects of An Educational Reform This paper provides new evidence on the role of the educational system for intergenerational mobility. I evaluate an educational reform, implemented in Sweden in the 1950s, which postponed ability tracking and extended compulsory education from seven to nine years. The reform may have influenced intergenerational mobility by several different mechanisms, both directly and indirectly through changing the degree of assortative mating. My results indicate that the reform indeed resulted in a sizeable increase in intergenerational income mobility, and in a lower educational association between children and parents. The reform also contributed to reducing the association in education between an individuals partner and parents, which I interpret as an effect operating through reform effects on mating patterns. Is the Gender Gap in School Performance Affected by the Sex of the Teacher? Girls outperform boys in school. We investigate whether the gender performance gap can be attributed to the fact that the teacher profession is female dominated, that is, is there a causal effect on student outcomes from having a same-sex teacher? Exploring the fact that teacher turnover and student mobility give rise to variation in teachers gender within student and subject, we estimate the effect on student outcomes of changing to a teacher of the same sex. We find no strong support for our initial hypothesis that a same-sex teacher improves student outcomes.",
    "883": "Conflicting views about the degree of long-run mobility across multiple generations persist because direct empirical evidence is scarce. Predictions are instead routinely derived by iteration of intergenerational measures, a procedure which implies high long-run mobility even when intergenerational mobility is low. However, the assumption that regression implies perpetual regression is a statistical fallacy.I examine this fallacy, its historical background, and its prevalence. I then present various simple models of intergenerational transmission to consider how the relation between intergenerational and multigenerational mobility is affected by elements of the transmission process. I discuss the role of market luck and indirect transmission; the multiplicity of skills; the role of grandparents; and the causal effect of parental income. The direction of bias depends on modeling assumptions, but elementary properties of the transmission process imply that long-run mobility will likely be lower, possibly much lower, than predictions from intergenerational evidence suggest.",
    "884": "Using NLSY data we investigate whether the observed patterns of economic mobility (as measured by income and educational attainment) exhibit heterogeneity across socioeco- nomic groups and whether the nature of the heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of persistence in the intergenerational transmission of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities across these groups. In doing so we employ the varying coefficient model (VCM) to estimate nonparametric (local) measures of intergenerational mobility of those outcome variables. By local we mean that the persistence coefficients are modeled as smooth func- tions of log parental permanent income. Our findings show that intergenerational mobility exhibits nonlinear patterns. Individuals with different parental income are characterized by different degrees of intergenerational mobility. Moreover, we find evidence that sug- gests cognitive abilities play a role in explaining intergenerational mobility. These findings provide some support for a new class of family investment models that emphasize the role of such abilities in economic mobility.",

The first has been widely studied and regards the differing incidence of divorce according to socio-economic background. The second has been studied less and is the heterogeneity in the effects of divorce according to parental background. This paper investigates whether signs from earlier research that children from higher social backgrounds suffer more from divorce can indeed be interpreted as such. We follow a cohort of British children born in 1970 (N = 11,073) and look at how educational and occupational outcomes differ depending on family structure, socio-economic background, and the interaction between them. We improve on earlier studies by including a rich set of pre-divorce characteristics and are able to show that heterogeneity in the effects of divorce indeed exists and is not likely to be due to selection effects. Children whose parents are more highly educated have a larger divorce penalty when it comes to educational and occupational attainment. A large part of the heterogeneity can be explained by the parents income at age 16, parental monitoring, the childs participation in extra-curricular activities and his or her views regarding the benefits of education at age 16. The results suggest that, in contrast to the emphasis put in much recent research, divorce seems to have been a factor contributing to increased intergenerational mobility in the period under study.",
    "886": "Contrary to a standard theoretical approach, evidence suggests that low income inequality, and high public school funding are not systematically as- sociated with high level of social mobility. The seminal paper of Checchi and al. (1999) oers an explanation to the puzzling situation some coun- tries experiment in this regard. They emphasize the role of incentives in the human capital accumulation process in private versus public school fund- ing. This paper proposes an extension of this model to account for mixed school regime. Two main ndings result from numerical computations of the model. (1) More decentralized nancing of school spending results in higher incentives for households to invest privately in their children's edu- cation. Consequently, the more decentralized schooling system, the higher social mobility and income inequality. (2) For a given school regime, higher level of intergenerational mobility translates into a lower level of income inequality because it strengthens households'demand for public spending in education. These two forces may explain why empirical evidence fails to detect the existence of a simple relation between public education, social mobility, and income inequality.",
    "887": "Esta tesis analiza temas de distribucion de la renta y desarrollo economico en economias caracterizadas por imperfecciones en el mercado de capitales. El primer capitulo estudia temas de distribucion de la renta. La mayoria de la literatura en ese campo a sido desarrollada bajo el supuesto que IMC (esto es imperfecciones en el mercado de capitales) son exogenas. La teoria convencional es que es muy poco probable que los individuos mas pobres puedan invertir porque tomar dinero a prestamo es muy caro en presencia de asimetrias informativas. Consecuentemente, los individuos mas pobres no invertiran y sus futuras generaciones permaneceran pobres. Basado en esta linea de pensamiento esta literatura concluye que IMC exogenas producen mayor desigualdad y menor movilidad intergeneracional. Contrariamente as estos analisis este articulo argumenta que cuando las IMC se endogenizan la movilidad intergeneracional aumentara entre los pobres e inteligentes individuos. En mi modelo existe un problema de seleccion adversa entre el prestamista y el prestatario, pues los bancos no saben la habilidad del prestatario. En este contexto los bancos ofrecen un menu de contratos que satisface la condicion de auto-seleccion. En equilibrio bancos diferencian entre agentes forzando a los mas inteligentes a invertir en educacion mas de lo optimo. De esta forma el agente menos inteligente no se hace pasar por el agente mas inteligente. Estos ultimos obtienen mas educacion de la que ellos desean, aumentando movilidad intergeneracional y la acumulacion de capital humano, que son mayores que en el mundo con informacion perfecta. Los resultados mas importantes de este paper son los siguientes: cuando se endogenizan las imperfecciones del mercado de capitales obtenemos que IMC aumentan movilidad intergeneracional y aumenta el numero de gente educados en el estado estacionario. Al estudiar desigualdad en renta, yo encuentro que los resultados son ambiguos. Por un lado el numero de gente con rentas muy bajas ha disminuido. Por otro lado la clase media de prestatarios inteligentes tienen una renta menor. Una de las cuestiones mas importantes que se hacen los economistas es porque paises pobres usan sus recursos de forma ineficiente. En el segundo capitulo nosotros (Andres Erosa y yo) proponemos una teoria donde IMC son el origen de las diferencias en TFP entre paises. En nuestra teoria los empresarios tienen informacion privada sobre la productividad de su tecnologia. Nosotros estudiamos como el contrato, descrito como la habilidad de hacer respetar el contrato, afecta la provision de incentivos, y por tanto, y de repartir los recursos entre los empresarios. Nosotros estudiamos un modelo de crecimiento donde los empresarios estan dotados de una tecnologia para producir un bien intermedio que es el input de la produccion final de bienes. Los empresarios necesitan financiacion externa para producir. Esta financiacion externa esta limitada por dos problemas: Primero, la productividad no es observable para los prestamistas. Segundo, los empresarios pueden pagar, como maximo, una fraccion de la produccion. Asumimos que los paises difieren en su capacidad de hacer respetar los contratos. Demostramos que, en la presencia de asimetrias de informacion, paises con baja capacidad de hacer respetar los contratos utilizan tecnologias ineficientes en equilibrio y es caracterizada por diferencias en productividad entre paises. Nuestra teoria sugiere que los empresarios tienen intereses en mantener en status quo con baja capacidad de hacer cumplir los contratos y esto hace posible que los empresarios extraigan rentas de los servicios que contratan. Nuestra teoria tiene implicaciones sobre la distribucion de los recursos entre sectores. En fin nuestra teoria implica que la tasa de impuestos sobre la renta puede ser mala para la actividad economica sobre todo cuando los mercados de capitales son imperfectos. This dissertation analyzes income distribution and economic development issues in macroeconomies with financial frictions. Chapter 1 focuses on income distribution issues. Most of the existing literature in this area has been developed under the assumption that CMI are exogenous. Their conventional view is that since becoming borrower is expensive under high imperfections in the capital markets, poor agents are less likely to make investment decisions. As a consequence their future generations will remain poor. Based on this thought these branch of the literature conclude that exogenous CMI lead to higher inequality and lower mobility. In contrast to these analyses this paper argues that when we endogenize CMI, intergenerational mobility may be promoted among poor and talented agents. In my model there is an adverse selection problem between borrowers and banks, since banks cannot identify borrowers ability. In this context banks offer a menu of contracts that satisfy the self-selection mechanism. In equilibrium banks differentiate between agents by forcing talented borrowers to make an investment in human capital larger than they would in the first best world. In this way low ability individuals do not pose as high ability ones. Talented children from poor families get educated even more than they wish, so that both income mobility and human capital accumulation are larger than in the first best world. The major results of this paper might be summarized as follows: when we endogenize imperfections in the capital market we obtain that CMI promotes intergenerational mobility and increases the number of educated people in the steady state. When we study inequality of wealth, we find that there are opposite effects making inequality unambiguos. On the one hand there is a small number of people in the lower bound of the wealth distribution. On the other hand the middle class of clever borrowers have a lower wealth. One of the most important research questions faced by economist is why poor countries use productive resources inefficiently. In the second chapter of the thesis we propose a theory where capital market imperfections are at the origin of cross-country TFP differences. In our theory entrepreneurs have private information about the multifactor productivity of their technology. We study how the contracting environment, as described by the ability to enforce contracts, affects the provision of incentives and, thus, resource allocation to and across entrepreneurs. We develop a growth model where entrepreneurs are endowed with a technology to produce an intermediate good that is an input in the production of final goods. Entrepreneurs need external funds in order to operate their technology. External financing is complicated by two problems: First, the productivity of the entrepreneurial technology can not be observed by lenders. Second, entrepreneurs can commit to pay, at most, a fraction of the output. We assume that countries differ in the ability to enforce loans contracts. We show that, in the presence of asymmetric information, countries with low enforcement use inefficient technologies in equilibrium and are characterized by differences in productivity across industries. Our theory also suggests that entrepreneurs have a vested interest in maintaining a status quo with low enforcement since it allows them to extract rents from the factor services they hire. Our theory has implications for the allocation of resources across industries that differ in their needs of external funds and provide some insights into why poor countries face large differences in productivity across sectors. Our theory also implies that income taxation can be more detrimental for economic activity when capital markets are imperfect."
