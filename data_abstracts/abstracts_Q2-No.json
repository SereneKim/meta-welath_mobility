We model rational agents as trying to learn from their dynastic income mobility experience the relative importance of effort and predetermined factors in the generation of income inequality and therefore the magnitude of these incentive costs. In the long run, left-wing dynasties believing less in individual effort and voting for more redistribution coexist with right-wing dynasties. This allows us to explain why individual mobility experience and not only current income matters for political attiitudes and how persistent differences in perceptions about social mobility can generate persistent differences in redistribution across countries.",

We model the size of two different public programs under the welfare state. We investigate bidimensional voting on the tax rates that determine the allocation of government revenues among transfer payments and old-age pensions. We show that the coalitions formed, the resulting political equilibria, and the demand for redistribution crucially depend on the level of income inequality and mobility.",

Human capital theory, as well as previous empirical research in economics suggests that as standard of living as a youth increases, future income as an adult should increase as well. The 1979 cohort as well as the 1997 cohort of the NLSY were studied in order to provide insight into how the relationship in question has changed over time. I hypothesize that as standard of living as a youth increases, so too will income as an adult. Furthermore I hypothesize that the level of income mobility will be greater for the 1979 cohort than the 1997 cohort.",
    "20": "In this article, we use cross-state panel and cross-U.S. commuting-zone data to look at the relationship between innovation, top income inequality and social mobility. We find positive correlations between measures of innovation and top income inequality. We also show that the correlations between innovation and broad measures of inequality are not significant. Next, using instrumental variable analysis, we argue that these correlations at least partly reflect a causality from innovation to top income shares. Finally, we show that innovation, particularly by new entrants, is positively associated with social mobility, but less so in local areas with more intense lobbying activities.",
    "23": "Social capital-the strength of an individual's social network and community-has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes ranging from education to health1-8. However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers9, we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by ZIP (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status (SES); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their associations with economic mobility across areas. The share of high-SES friends among individuals with low SES-which we term economic connectedness-is among the strongest predictors of upward income mobility identified to date10,11. Other social capital measures are not strongly associated with economic mobility. If children with low-SES parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-SES parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20% on average. Differences in economic connectedness can explain well-known relationships between upward income mobility and racial segregation, poverty rates, and inequality12-14. To support further research and policy interventions, we publicly release privacy-protected statistics on social capital by ZIP code at",
    "24": "The premise of this paper is twofold. First, peoples aspirations for their future wellbeing (or that of their children) aect their incentives to invest. Second, the experiences of others help shape ones aspirations. This paper marries a model of aspirations-based choice with a simple theory of aspirations formation to study the relationship between aspirations and the distribution of income. Through its impact on investments, aspirations aect economic mobility and the income distribution, which in turn shape aspirations. Thus aspirations, income, and the distribution of income evolve jointly, and in many situations in a self-reinforcing way. We study the consequences of this model for income distribution as well as for growth rates over dierent quantiles of the distribution. We show that extreme equality is unstable. Moreover, when the same aspirations are shared in a society, polarization arises. The theory we propose captures both the complacency stemming from low aspirations and the frustration resulting from aspirations that are too high. As a result, for commonly held aspirations, growth rates have an inverted U-shape along the income distribution.",
    "25": "A major finding in comparative mobility research is the high similarity across countries and the lack of association between mobility and other national attributes, with one exception: higher inequality seems to be associated with lower mobility. Evidence for the mobility-inequality link is, however, inconclusive, largely because most mobility studies have been conducted in advanced countries with relatively similar levels of inequality. This article introduces Chile to the comparative project. As the 10th most unequal country in the world, Chile is an adjudicative case. If high inequality results in lower mobility, Chile should be significantly more rigid than its industrialized peers. This hypothesis is disproved by the analysis. Despite vast economic inequality, Chile is as fluid, if not more so, than the much more equal industrialized nations. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a decline in mobility as the result of the increase in inequality during the market-oriented transformation of the country in the 1970s and 1980s. Study of the specific mobility flows in Chile indicates a significant barrier to long-range downward mobility from the elite (signaling high elite closure) but very low barriers across nonelite classes. This particular mobility regime is explained by the pattern, not the level, of Chilean inequality-high concentration in the top income decile, but significantly less inequality across the rest of the class structure. The high Chilean mobility is, however, largely inconsequential, because it takes place among classes that share similar positions in the social hierarchy of resources and rewards. The article concludes by redefining the link between inequality and mobility.",
    "32": "This article demonstrates how class origin shapes earnings in higher professional and managerial employment. Taking advantage of newly released data in Britains Labour Force Survey, we examine the relative openness of different high-status occupations and the earnings of the upwardly mobile within them. In terms of access, we find a distinction between traditional professions, such as law, medicine, and finance, which are dominated by the children of higher managers and professionals, and more technical occupations, such as engineering and IT, that recruit more widely. Moreover, even when people who are from working-class backgrounds are successful in entering high-status occupations, they earn 17 percent less, on average, than individuals from privileged backgrounds. This class-origin pay gap translates to up to 7,350 ($11,000) lower annual earnings. This difference is partly explained by the upwardly mobile being employed in smaller firms and working outside London, but it remains substantial even net of a variety of important predictors of earnings. These findings underline the value of investigating differences in mobility rates between individual occupations as well as illustrating how, beyond entry, the mobile population often faces an earnings class ceiling within high-status occupations.",
    "34": "After decades of stagnation, the size of the middle class in Latin America and the Caribbean recently expanded by 50 percent from 103 million people in 2003 to 152 million (or 30 percent of the continent's population) in 2009. Over the same period, as household incomes grew and inequality edged downward in most countries, the proportion of people in poverty fell markedly: from 44 percent to 30 percent. As a result, the middle class and the poor now account for roughly the same share of Latin America's population. This is in stark contrast to the situation prevailing (for a long period) until about 10 years ago, when the share of the poor hovered around 2.5 times that of the middle class. This study investigates the nature, determinants, and possible consequences of this remarkable process of social transformation. Such large changes in the size and composition of social classes must, by definition, imply substantial economic mobility of some form. A large number of people who were poor in the late 1990s are now no longer poor. Others who were not yet middle class have now joined its ranks. But social and economic mobility does not mean the same thing to different people or in different contexts. This report discusses the relevant concepts and documents the facts about mobility in Latin America and the Caribbean over the past two decades, both within and between generations. In addition, it investigates the rise of the Latin American middle class over the past 10-15 years and explores the size, nature, and composition of this pivotal new social group. More speculatively, it also asks how the rising middle class may reshape the region's social contract.",
    "36": "In the contemporary uncertain labour market situation, the tradition of upward mobility, or the chance for all workers to improve their earnings, may be a thing of the past in the United States of America (USA) In a competitive economic environment, many companies that once offered the opportunity for advancement to workers, have reinvented themselves as leaner enterprises with more flexible work forces. This publication presents empirical research into the prospects for upward mobility of workers in this new economic environment. The research is based on a comparison of the career outcomes of two generations of young, white men over the course of their working lives. It documents the gap between the upwardly mobile and the increasing numbers of workers trapped in low-wage jobs. The first generation entered the labour market during the late 1960s during a period of stability and prosperity. The second generation entered working life during the early 1980s, a period of recession, deregulation, and the weakening of organised labour. This comparative research reveals trends indicating that the new labour market is harsher than that of the 1960s. A 'pyramid' situation has evolved where highly qualified, well-connected workers at the top of the employment pyramid move from job to job, improving their earnings as they proceed, and a growing number of lower skilled workers are consigned to low paid, 'dead-end' jobs. The authors conclude with a discussion of policy strategies to improve career pathways and promote opportunities for all workers to enhance their earning power. The strategies are based on regional partnerships that link corporate, union, government, and community resources.",
    "46": "The paper examines the impact of income inequality and mobility on income redistribution in a modified median voter model where redistributive conflict takes place both between educational groups and age-groups. The effects of inequality and mobility are not unambiguous but depend on factors such as how mobility changes in different groups and causes of inequality. We also examine the effect of the length of electoral periods on redistribution and welfare for different groups and allow for majority voting on the length of electoral periods. Finally, we extend the model to encompass retirement and baby booms.",

However, this recession has affected middle-income families, whose experiences with economic challenge have seldom been looked at in any detail. Such families have been recently called the new poor, the missing middle, and families in the middle. One in seven American children under age 18 (10.5 million) has an unemployed parent as a result of this recession, and because economic mobility for children in the U.S. is affected by their parents earning capacities, their mobility potential may be mediated by parents strategies for childrens educational futures. The research presented here, which is informed by Weberian stratification theory and capital theories, is based on a longitudinal subset of a larger two-country, multicity, mixed-methods study that used surveys and qualitative semi-structured interviews to explore how middle-income families contend with economic downturn and how their adolescent childrens educational futures might be influenced. Our findings suggest that most families maintain their childrens developmental and educational status quo, but their strategies to do so constrict the potential for educational attainment. As such, the American approach to off-loading much of the cost of higher education to middle-income families who are economically stressed is not viable if we hope to maximize the number of children who will receive mobility-enhancing postsecondary education.",
    "48": "Many progressive American policy analysts point to Denmark as a model welfare state with low levels of income inequality and high levels of income mobility across generations. It has in place many social policies now advocated for adoption in the U.S. Despite generous Danish social policies, family influence on important child outcomes in Denmark is about as strong as it is in the United States. More advantaged families are better able to access, utilize, and influence universally available programs. Purposive sorting by levels of family advantage create neighborhood effects. Powerful forces not easily mitigated by Danish-style welfare state programs operate in both countries.",

It was found that Notre Dame football players came from much lower socioeconomic backgrounds than regular Notre Dame students. In terms of social mobility, both ballplayers and regular students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have moved well beyond their social origins. Only in educational attainment do the two groups differ significantly. Among ballplayers, first teamers experienced greater income mobility than second teamers and reserves. First team ballplayers were also found to be over-represented as top ranking executives in their companies.",

We present statistical models of income dynamics that mechanically give rise to the relationship between inequality and mobility. Five distinct classes of theories are developed, including models on family investments, skills, social influences, political economy, and aspirations, each providing a behavioral mechanism to explain the relationship. Finally, we review empirical studies that provide evidence of the curve for a range of contexts and socioeconomic outcomes as well as explore evidence on mechanisms.",
    "63": "This paper examines the effect of educational assortative mating on overall income mobility in terms of both inter- and intragenerational mobility. In recent years, educational assortative mating has become a trend in China, and this marital sorting pattern not only contributes to marriage stability but is also related to increased income mobility. Educational assortative mating affects the distribution of educational resources among families with diffferent educational qualifications. Families with higher educational qualifications have more educational resources, thus obtaining a more solid income status. Educational assortative mating has the most significant influence on the income mobility of the low-income group, as high-quality educational resources are the key to enabling this group to raise its income status. This paper argues that, in the future, income mobility should be promoted by evenly distributing social education resources and reducing the resource constraints on the upward mobility of the low-income group.",
    "69": "Despite decades of research on social mobility and wage disparities, it remains a puzzle why people from lower-class families earn less than people from upper-class families even when similar in education and occupational prestige. Taking a sociocultural perspective on social class, we argue that a key contributor to the class pay gap is that people from upper-class origins tend to work in occupations with greater autonomy, whereas their lower-class counterparts tend to work in occupations that are more prosocial. We further propose that autonomous occupations pay better than prosocial occupations. Across two distinct nationally representative samples in the United States, we find that people with upper-class (vs. lower-class) parents are more likely to work in autonomous occupations, but less likely to work in prosocial occupations, even when controlling for education, occupational prestige, and other potential confounds. This pattern of occupational sorting explains a substantial portion of the class pay gap. Our study extends the literatures on social class, occupational segregation, and social mobility, and joins an important scholarly conversation that has, until recently, taken place outside the field of management.",
    "75": "Inequality in the allocation of opportunities has always been one of the main sources of economic concern on national and global scale. At national level, income mobility is a criterion that measures the degree of equality and inequality of opportunities in a society. In this paper, a type of pattern data building pseudo-panel is designed in order to examine the effects of income mobility on consuming welfare of urban male heads of household in Iran. The pattern is designed by combining cross-sectional data of household budget of generations of families that are in the years 1988 to 2011 on track. The results indicate that the middle age generation has higher income mobility and lower opportunity inequality compared to young generation. The more the opportunity inequality is, the larger the consuming gap will become between individuals. Therefore, by reduction of inequality of opportunities, the increase of consuming welfare can be seen.",
    "87": "Although the precise definition of social mobility is a matter of debate, it is associated to a situation in which the relative economic status of an agent is not dependent on starting conditions such as parental income or family background. Analyzing the determinants of mobility involves exploring the channels through which offspring's income is correlated to its parents' such as education, opportunities or economic status. This survey explores in an analytical framework, the relation between social mobility and inequality, among other important dimensions of income distribution that are jointly determined. The focus is on the relevance of social mobility as it affects variables determining welfare and economic efficiency, and therefore on policies to promote it.",
    "88": "Empirical evidence on distributional preferences shows that people do not judge inequality as problematic per se but that they take into account the fairness or unfairness of the outcome. This article conceptualizes a view of unfair inequality and introduces a new measure of inequality based on two widely held fairness principles: equality of opportunity and freedom from poverty. It develops a method for decomposing inequality and its trends into an unfair and a fair component. We provide two empirical applications of our measure. First, we analyse the development of inequality in the US from 1969 to 2014 from a fairness perspective. Second, we conduct a corresponding international comparison between the US and 31 European countries in 2010. Our results document that unfair inequality matches the well-documented inequality growth in the US since 1980. This trend is driven by decreases in social mobility, i.e. increasing importance of parental education and occupation for the income of their children. Among the 32 countries of our international comparison, the land of opportunity ranks among the most unfair societies in 2010.",
    "89": "Class structure and class formation are two crucial aspects of class. The former relates to differences in market positions and the latter concerns social factors such as interaction, mobility and class action. This paper is based on Swedish data covering the period from 1975 to 1995. Analysis reveals a persistent class hierarchy and that there is no trend towards declining class differences regarding market position. The situation is better described as being in a state of non-linear flux. However, one persistent trend is discernible; class explains less and less of the variance in wage income. Looking at class formation there is a decline over time in class-homogeneity. Most Swedes are mobile in the sense that they end up in a class position different from their father's. A growing majority of all marriage is also class mixed. However, although classes generally lack homogeneity, social boundaries still exist, i.e. tendencies for immobility and class homogeneous marriage. In relation to the `class-is-dying' hypothesis, the results generally indicate the continuing relevance of class, although the view of classes as homogeneous social groups is increasingly troublesome over time.",
    "93": "We investigate how families resolve an important intrafamily household allocation probleminvesting in their children's postsecondary educationin the context of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. This legislation allowed service members to transfer education benefits to a family member in exchange for additional military service. Descriptive analysis reveals clear socioeconomic differences in patterns of transfer: utilization rates are highest among senior service members, who are better educated and earn higher wages, and are lowest among less educated, lower-wage junior soldiers. This pattern of use suggests that the transfer provision may have limited impact on intergenerational mobility for service members of low socioeconomic status.",
    "94": "This paper presents an analysis of what types of values, especially in regard to obedience vs. independence, families impart to their children, and how these values interact with social mobility. In the model, obedience is a useful characteristic for employers, especially when wages are low, because independent workers require more incentives (when wages are high, these incentives are automatic) Hence in lowwage environments, lowincome families will impart values of obedience to their children to prevent disadvantaging them in the labour market. To the extent that independence is useful for entrepreneurial activities, this then depresses their social mobility. Highincome and privileged parents, on the other hand, always impart values of independence, since they expect that their children can enter into higherincome entrepreneurial (or managerial) activities thanks to their family resources and privileges. I also discuss how political activity can be hampered when labour market incentives encourage greater obedience, and how this can generate multiple steady states with different patterns of social hierarchy and mobility.",

    "102": "This paper studies the effects of migrations on growth and income distribution when social mobility is imperfect. Workers migrate in response to differences in expected wages between home and a foreign country, but their choice depends also whether they qualified themselves as skilled workers by accumulating human capital or not. Such an activity has a cost, which depends on each agents family background: sons of skilled workers have lower human capital accumulation costs. The effects of labour migrations on per capita income depend only on the degree of social mobility: if there is a difference in the cost of accumulating human capital for the sons of educated and noneducated people, migrations reduce total earnings of unskilled workers in the receiving country, and increase those of skilled workers.",

Despite the recent disenchantment with the viewpoint that all classes share in the benefits of industrial growth, empirical data on the distribution of income, business opportunity, and economic power are in short supply. This study, which focuses on the origins of manufacturing entrepreneurs in a newly industrializing city in coastal Andhra, India, offers one perspective on vertical socioeconomic mobility, and the differences in economic opportunities between the privileged and underprivileged portions of the population. A highly disproportional number of the entrepreneurs (especially successful ones) are from twiceborn castes and from families with a high economic status. Members of the dominant castes, leading classes, and large business houses can avert the threat of democratization, industrialization and modernization to the positions of their families by using the advantages of the pastproperty, influence, status and so forthto obtain the concessions, experience, education, training, and industrial capital usually essential for successful industrial undertakings.

The results of Tobit model indicate that household income, head education, head age, household size, number of school-age children and residing in urban areas are the most significant factors affecting education expenditure. Interestingly, the results show that the income elasticity of education in urban sample model is greater than that of rural model, implying that households residing in urban areas are likely to spend more on education. In addition, the effect of household income is found to be positive and significant in the highest income quintile. Overall, the results revealed that households with higher income, whose heads are educated and reside in urban areas tends to spend more on education compared to poor and rural households. These results signify the lack of inter-generational educational and income mobility in Sudan, implying that children from poor households are caught permanently in low income and educational levels, and are not able to catch up their peers in high income families.

    "110": "While inter-generational income mobility is commonly understood to be socially desirable in that it promotes equality of life chances, social desirability of intra-generational income mobility is a much more controversial issue, which is known to be concerned with inequality and uncertainty effects, as well as aversion to income fluctuations. In this paper social welfare effects of intra-generational income mobility are investigated from the perspective of an opportunity egalitarian social planner. We show that, given the trade-off between inequality and uncertainty effects, social desirability of income mobility strongly depends on the characteristics of income switchings which are required to be rewarding the more deserving individuals and/or compensating the unluckier ones. In this sense, we suggest that egalitarianism of opportunity, more than aversion to intertemporal fluctuations, is crucial for motivating the optimality of empirically observed low degrees of income mobility as compared to perfect mobility processes (complete reversal)",

The paper argues that the joint effect of rising marital homogamy in terms of human capital and labour supply contributes generally to widen the income gap between households. Only uner very restrictive conditions, namely when the labour supply of low educated women grows dis-proportionally fast, will women's earnings contribute to more equality. Finally, the paper suggests that women's rising employment commitments contribute positively to equalizing the opportunity structure both via the income effect and if quality care is available, also via more homogenous cultural and cognitive stimulation of children. Mother's work does not generally have adverse effects for children's development.",

Zainichi Korean is a minority group that came to Japan since 1910 when Korean Peninsula was annexed by Japanese. Korean who came to Japan that time worked as daily worker in farming area, ship building, contruction site or other places. After World War II was ended, part of those Korean stayed remain in Japan, until this moment for fourth or fifth generatons. Decades ago, discrimination against Korean immigrants made it difficult for them to earn a decent living, as they struggled to find a decent work. They could only work as day laborers. However, due to various supporting factors such as opportunities and good cooperation, most of these Korean immigrants were able to own a Pachinko business, and even almost controlled the jewelry shop business in Osaka as the center of a settlement of the most Korean immigrants in Japan. This change shows the social mobility of Korean immigrants to a higher socioeconomic class. On the other hand, the factor that hinders the occurrence of mobility is the discriminatory attitude towards Zainichi Korean.",

The article illustrates how the transnational connections of nurses create cleavages among them as a micro-class category in the host state and argues how the social class position of the family continues to impact on the class conditions of migrants especially those from lower income backgrounds. In contrast, the financial independence of higher income families leads to better life chances for nurses allowing them to invest in additional economic capital, pursue personal projects and improve their symbolic capital. This can be described as the social reproduction of inequality on a transnational scale, which has repercussions on the present and future class conditions of migrants. The article contributes to discussions on class conditions and mobility from a transnational frame.",
    "126": "Income inequality can vary rather dramatically across societies. While in some countries the average income of the richest 10% does not exceed 5 or 6 times that of the poorest 10% in others the same ratio can reach up to 90 or 100. Moreover, such dierences can persist and even increase over long periods of time. In order to address such facts, we develop a theory, based on socio-cultural evolution, that highlights the stability and heterogeneity of a societys economic environment as a fundamental source of long-term inequality. We show that steady and diverse economic environments provide a selective advantage for the evolution of equality, whereas uctuating and singular ones promote inequality. We also show that more equal societies exhibit a higher degree of social mobility and are more resilient and robust in the sense of being quicker to recover from shocks and to return to normalcy than unequal ones. We thus provide a rationale for the emergence of inequality, its persistence and negative correlation with social mobility, as well as its role in determining the fragility of a society.",

Laeken poverty indicators based on the Survey on Income and Living the at-risk-of-poverty-rate for unemployed persons is 50.6% while the at-risk-of-poverty-rate for employed persons is 9.9% The pluralism of the 90s began with the ideals for equal opportunities but people are now desperate and they are struggling with their own illusions. Despite the fact that many are experiencing vertical mobility, this is more a result of changes in the employment structure rather than the existence of a high level of equal opportunities. On the other hand, globalization is urging geographical mobility at large, and this makes young generations migrate in larger cities and more developed countries. The inequalities between people are becoming more evident especially the new lifestyle of the rich stratum of the society such as politicians, businesspersons, real estate owners and traders. This paper deals with issues that concern movements of entire generations based on their education level and jobs they perform, in externally highly influenced environments. Women in Macedonia are increasingly enrolling at universities and this makes them competent for many professions. However, statistical indicators show that they are not yet present enough in managerial positions in various different institutions or on the highly paid jobs lists. The salary in Macedonia are low. assert the importance of mobility for understanding modern industrial society, particularly its stratified character Through statistical data, we will attempt to prove the above-mentioned approaches.

Based on these datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic propensity for educational attainment have been constructed. It is by now well established that this PGS predicts wages, income, and occupational prestige and occupational mobility across generations. It is unknown whether a PGS for educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about 53 years of age) conditional on 1974 values of these variables and a range of covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status, is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (ii) conditional on 1974 outcomes, higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with more than a high school education; (iii) throughout their employment history, high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (iv) though no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to our understanding of longitudinal inequality across careers and shed light on the sources of heterogeneity in responses to economic shocks and policy.",

This paper defines social mobility as a situation in which the relative economic status of an agent is not dependent on starting conditions such as parental income or family background. Analyzing the determinants of mobility involves exploring the channels through which offsprings income is correlated to its parents, such as inherited bequest, education, skills, among many others. This survey explores, in an analytical framework, the relation between social mobility and inequality, among other important dimensions of income distribution that are jointly determined. The focus is on the relevance of social mobility as it affects variables determining welfare and economic efficiency, and therefore on policies to promote it.",

The degree of inter-generational mobility of income and class status is not very low in cross-national comparison, but it has decline consistently since the beginning of 21st century in Korea. Especially decline in the level of structural mobility is more pronounced compared to the level of circular mobility. Decline in the level of social mobility can be attributed to the increasing inequality and the change of education from the medium of mobility to medium of inheritance. In order to promote social mobility, following policy measures are recommended: increased provision of jobs targeting youth; welfare policy focusing on redistribution; educational reform to increase inclusiveness; active anti-discriminational policies.",

That is, the chance of upward mobility for Americans is just a half that of the citizens of the Denmark and many other European countries. In addition to other influences, sprawling development patterns, dispersed job locations, and high job inaccessibility may contribute to the low rate of upward mobility in the U.S. In this study, the authors seek to test the relationship between urban sprawl and upward mobility for commuting zones in the U.S. They use structural equation modeling to account for both direct and indirect effects of sprawl on upward mobility. They find that upward mobility is significantly higher in compact areas than sprawling areas. The direct effect, which they attribute to better job accessibility in more compact commuting zones, is stronger than the indirect effects. Of the indirect effects, only one, through the mediating variable income segregation, is significant.",

The issue addressed is important because of the policy focus on income inequality in the country for the last five and a half decades, and the coverage of the data collected renders the data set used in his analysis to be the first of its kind for Malaysia. The findings from his survey indicate that educational mobility is high, with 62 percent of children being better educated than their parents. This is not surprising in view of the fact that the relatively high level of educational expenditure in Malaysia has led to significant improvements in student enrollment, resulting in almost near-universal access at the primary and lower secondary levels (Malaysia 2013) Obtaining more education does not necessarily translate to upward occupational or income mobility, You do not currently have access to this content.",

Looking into how occupations would be passed down to children as their own occupations, the study investigated how the incomes, occupations (job family) and educational levels are transferred to a generation of their children, and that way, the study was able to see if all those factors of the parents have any influential effects on the childrens achieving of the occupational class. First, regarding the occupational class mobility of the parents and children, it was observed that the childrens occupational class has improved. Second, the higher the childrens educational level, the less it influences the subordinate occupational cluster. Third, the educational levels of the children would be affected by the parents (occupations, educational levels and incomes of the parents) Of all those factors, the educational levels of the parents were confirmed to have the greatest effect on the education of the children. The study, now, concludes that what the parents do for living does have concern with the childrens careers in the future. In addition, it has been practically proved in this study that the childrens occupational determination would eventually fall under the influence of the occupations, educational levels and incomes as the children go through any educational curriculums.",
    "146": "This paper presents an analysis of what types of values, especially in regards to obedience vs. independence, families impart to their children and how these values interact with social mobility. In the model, obedience is a useful characteristic for employers, especially when wages are low, because independent workers require more incentives (when wages are high, these incentives are automatic) Hence, in low-wage environments, low-income families will impart values of obedience to their children to prevent disadvantaging them in the labor market. To the extent that independence is useful for entrepreneurial activities, this then depresses their social mobility. High-income and privileged parents, on the other hand, always impart values of independence, since they expect that their children can enter into higher-income entrepreneurial (or managerial) activities thanks to their family resources and privileges. I also discuss how political activity can be hampered when labor market incentives encourage greater obedience and how this can generate multiple steady states with different patterns of social hierarchy and mobility.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

Using a rich dataset on income and consumption of Indian households, we estimate the distributional effects of such interventions in a heterogeneous agent model. The standard scheme of interventions that consistently targets lower-income cohorts, has muted distributional impacts. However, a fiscally-equivalent scheme that changes the expected income profile of the targeted households in the same initial cohort irrespective of their future incomes, generates substantially larger effects by changing their income mobility. Quantitatively, such an intervention in the order of 0.6 percent of the output, approximating the Indian scenario, increases consumption share of the targeted group by nearly 2.5 percent, five times as large as the effect of standard interventions. As the intervention becomes larger in magnitude and scope, as is empirically observed in other developing countries, this intensive margin effect becomes stronger along with the extensive margin.",

This article suggests three general mechanisms to account for this: the tunnel effect, related to perceptions of generational mobility; the procedural justice effect, related to the perceived fairness in the process of getting ahead; and the middle-class effect, related to perceptions of the current social structure. The suggested mechanisms are tested by means of the ISSP 2009 module, which includes 38 countries. The three mechanisms account for a considerable part of the cross-national differences. The relatively high tolerance for current income differences in countries such as Denmark, Norway and China, and low tolerance in countries such as Ukraine, Hungary and Bulgaria, are well explained by the theoretical framework. By means of model residuals it is also shown which countries should be considered exceptional. Finally, as in previous research, no link was found between actual income inequality and acceptance of current income differences.",

In the context of a non-overlapping generations growth model with high-skilled and low-skilled employees, we argue that a potential explanation for this result is that growth policies ignore the importance of income redistribution. Even though reforms enhance economic growth, most of their benefits might be transferred to high-skilled individuals. Their low-skilled counterparts gains from economic growth are instead low and therefore this group remains sensitive to income transfers. If the latter are not provided, the reformist regimes likelihood to survive in power declines, even though its policies results in higher growth rates. We also show that a policy which enhances social mobility, thus helping low-skilled individuals to transit to the high-skilled group, can be a long-run substitute for income redistribution, but can not replace the latter in the short term.",

    "164": "In this paper, the author describes and criticizes the theory of non-competitive groups. According to this theory, the non-competitivity of social groups refers to the existence and the reproduction by heredity of a bi-univocal correspondence between the hierarchy of social groups and the hierarchy of employments. Such a relation comes from the fact that the social origins determine the level of education, the distribution of inborn qualities, and the preference functions of individuals. It is also the result of the demographic reproduction pattern of social groups. In such conditions, the incomes hierarchy is the result as well as the means of the hereditary reproduction of social structure and of non-competitivity. Two basic criticisms can be formulated. First, this theory is unable to justify most of the relation underlying the analysis. Second, the proposed explanation model is unable to account for the contemporary ways of non-competitivity such as indicated by the statistics on social mobility.",
    "165": "Wealth is a central determinant of life chances and intergenerational status persistence in modern societies. Despite increasing attention, sociologists traditionally overlooked its role in class-based economic disparities, while most economists focused on the elites accumulation. This article combines sociological and economic perspectives to test whether big occupational classes, the most standardised and operationalisable approach, depict the wealth distribution. Drawing from the Luxembourg Wealth Study (20022018) in five European countries, we explore (1) how wealth is distributed and stratified by big occupational classes over time and cross-nationally and (2) to what extent classes account for aggregate wealth inequality trends compared with income. Unlike bold claims on class 'death' or 'decomposition' inequality of outcomes in wealth accumulation is firmly rooted across big occupational classes in contemporary capitalism, potentially harming social mobility in future generations. Still, occupational classes better capture between-group income inequality and stratification than wealth, emphasising the importance of economic resources beyond labour market attachment. Against the backdrop of previous research and our findings, we discuss the role of wealth in contemporary class analysis.",
    "167": "Class structure and class formation are two crucial aspects of class. The former relates to differences in market positions and the latter concerns social factors such as interaction, mobility and class action. This paper is based on Swedish data covering the period from 1975 to 1995. Analysis reveals a persistent class hierarchy and that there is no trend towards declining class differences regarding market position. The situation is better described as being in a state of non-linear flux. However, one persistent trend is discernible; class explains less and less of the variance in wage income. Looking at class formation there is a decline over time in class-homogeneity. Most Swedes are mobile in the sense that they end up in a class position different from their father's. A growing majority of all marriage is also class mixed. However, although classes generally lack homogeneity, social boundaries still exist, i.e. tendencies for immobility and class homogeneous marriage. In relation to the class-is-dying hypothesis, the results generally indicate the continuing relevance of class, although the view of classes as homogenous social groups is increasingly troublesome over time.",
    "168": "An analysis of the Class Background Registers of Yanshan county, Hebei, shows that households of landlord and rich peasant status accounted for less than 10 percent of the local population and possessed less than 15 percent of the land, while households of poor and lower-middle peasant standing owned about half of the land. Overall, land distribution was relatively balanced, as seen in the Gini coefficient of 0.30.4 in the distribution of land rights and the fact that about half of the households owned 25 mu of land per capita. But the economic condition of the rural population was not determined by the factor of land distribution alone; in places where the natural endowment was poor, off-farm income-making activities mattered a great deal to local residents. Such activities took various forms, which could improve as well as worsen peoples livelihood. An analysis of social mobility in this area further shows the perpetuation of the existing class structure. Those whose grandparents had lived in poverty found it difficult to move up socially. On the whole, the rural area under study shows a prolonged trend of deterioration, which is meaningful for understanding the land reform.",
    "169": "South Africa has achieved major poverty reductions in the post-Apartheid era, but substantial variations in progress between population groups have been documented, and inequalities between poor Black communities and other parts of South Africa persist. Similarly, life chances and inter-generational mobility vary with proximal early life economic environments. The long-term interrelationships of different aspects of these environments are not well understood. Using prospective data from the Birth to Thirty (Bt30) cohort, we assess the relative importance of early life family and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) for later life educational attainment and criminality among Black children from low-income communities in Soweto-Johannesburg, South Africa. We follow a multi-step nonparametric adjusted regression approach to reduce assumptions about the nature of the relationships between outcomes and exposure variables, and we express interactions as nonlinear marginal effects. Our study finds that both childhood home SES and neighborhood SES are predictive of more favorable outcomes later in life. Home SES appears generally more predictive of young adulthood outcomes than neighborhood SES, particularly for educational outcomes. Girls fare substantially better both in terms of educational attainment and in terms of lower criminal engagement. These pro-female gaps appear to be particularly large in higher SES homes for educational attainment. Our findings highlight the critical importance of children's home environments in general, and particularly for children's educational attainment. Further support for programs to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in the current adult population can likely contribute substantially to reducing inequalities in future generations.",
    "172": "In the \"Social Life of Money for Children,\" Nina Bandelj proposes several concepts to reframe how sociologists ought to think about shifting trends in parental expenditure. Bandelj argues that there is a cultural shift in what parenting now meansand what it entailsthat is evidenced by changes in how parents spend on, and save for, their children. For Bandelj, parents' expenditures on children are better conceptualized as parental investments. The complementary concept of invested parenting, Bandelj posits, better evokes how spending on one's child is also about how parents' own identities are invested in being specific types of parents who provide particular goods and experiences, to their children, as well as setting their children up for financial wealth. Bandelj thus extends Zelizer's (1985) argument that children evolved from being economically useful to emotionally priceless to suggest that now children are the human capital investment child, such that parents seek to equip their children to allow for increased economic productivity from them upon adulthood. Invested parenting focuses conceptually on parents and what they do financially for their children and the meaning this holds for parents. In my response to Bandelj, I will consider how invested parenting may often be facilitated by kinprimarily grandparents, but also aunts and uncles. Here, I point to how kin play an important role in allowing parents to provide a childhood (and, at times, an adulthood) for their children that is seen as best suited to setting children up for a \"successful\" life (which in their vision means accessing specific types of education, being prepared for certain occupations, and generally having continued access to a range of opportunity) Sociologists show that someone's income provides an inadequate understanding of how they are placed socio-economically. While wealth can be harder to measure, many argue that it provides a far more holistic understanding of economic resources at someone's disposal () Wealth, however, is better understood intergenerationally; paying attention to how resources transfer between kin is crucial. When it comes to invested parenting, I suggest that similar attention to how parents garner the considerable resources needed to accomplish invested parenting is critical. My response to Bandelj's concept of invested parenting draws on my study of affluent parents in the U.S. who experienced unemployment. They made great efforts to minimize disruption to their children's lives, and this was accomplished through the help of kin. In this process, parents' viewed expenditure on children's education as sacrosanct. They were often able to maintain these expenses through the duration of unemployment because of financial intervention from kin. Bandelj's focus on conceptualizing children as parental investments comes within the context of a broader sociological discussion on how parents seek to shield their children from the economic and financial tumults that have become endemic to economic life in the 21st century. Privileged families are acutely attuned to the uncertain and unequal winner-takes-all economy, and experience an intense \"fear of falling\" () Parental anxieties are vested in their children's futures. Affluent parents particularly experience a heightened sense of insecurity () and anxiety () pertaining to their children's potential downward mobility. argues that deploying emotions such as anxiety propels privileged youth to proactively anticipate and strive to counter uncertainties. finds that affluent parents respond to insecurity by engaging in a \"security project\" of \"upscaling,\" in which mothers stay at home in order to more closely monitor children's educational, extra-curricular, and social developments. Cooper argues that upscaling is primarily an emotional strategy, and a response to the risk climate that the affluent encounter. She writes that upscaling \"allows the affluent to feel they are maintaining and reproducing their class privilege in a volatile world\" ( ) Given increasing economic inequality in the U.S (Chetty et al. 2016; ) scholars are concerned with the forms that social and economic privilege takes. Affluent parents, those in the professional middle classes for instance, play a key part in preserving privileges for their children.1 Parents transmit important material advantages to their children, often through expenditure on education, enrichment activities, and consumer goods and experiences. Privileged parents invest in educational opportunities for pre-college and college education () including sending children to selective and expensive private schools () Parents risk indebtedness as they pursue goals expected to foster children's upward class mobility, including college education () Affluent parents spend a considerable amount of money on children's enrichment activities (Levey ) These parents tend to view enrichment activities as essential for developing well-rounded children who will be valued by educational and occupational institutions in the future (; Levey ) Expenditure on children, or as Bandelj prefers, parental investments in children, have increased substantially in the U.S. since the mid-1970s and appear to be a \"sacred expense\" () for privileged families. The swell in parental expenditure, especially by privileged parents, has coincided with rising U.S. income inequality. Intensive parenting values and styles are dominant in economies with high levels of economic inequality and may help maintain privileged families' advantages (; ) Parents in countries with high inequality, like the U.S. favor intensive parenting as a way to prevent their children from becoming a \"have not\" in a context where the costs of being on the lower economic rungs are far higherand far more visiblethan in more economically equal societies. Indeed, parental investment in children is sensitive to the economic context in seemingly paradoxical ways. During the Great Recession, high-income families in the U.S. became even more likely to spend more on children's education than they had in prior years, while low- and middle-income families did not significantly change their spending on children's education () Why these families would spend more in a context of economic uncertainty remains unclear, and can likely be better explained by the meanings these parents attribute to such expenditures. Affluent parents also strive to transmit non-material resources to their children. These have typically been conceptualized as dispositions, preferences, and behaviorsor cultural capitalwhich can help their children effectively navigate institutions such as education and work (; Johnson et al. 2019; ) Parents thus play an important role in teaching children how to embody privilege to their advantage.2 In her classic work, shows how middle class parents prioritize an intensive approach of \"concerted cultivation,\" through which they negotiate with teachers on their children's behalf, and seek to inculcate in their children the ability to successfully navigate institutions to maximize children's own preferences. Building on this work, explains how privileged parents coach children to interact with authority figures such as teachers, again to optimize their own educational experiences and outcomes. In recent years, nurturing \"exploratory\" cultural tastes and preferences, including eating a range of foods, traveling widely, and possessing knowledge of a wide assortment of cultural products, goods, and experiences has also become an important aspect of parenting (Fielding-; ; Weinberger, Zavisca, and ) Such cultural knowledge, valued by parents in itself, has also been linked to occupational success in elite workplaces () Essentially, what research on parenting suggests is that for advantaged parents, parenting is an extensive financial and time investment. Cultivating such preferences requires money. Recent research indicates that support for intensive parenting appears to transcend class lines, but the ability to comply with it remains restricted to affluent families () As the above review of the literature shows, parenting is expensive. And as Bandelj argues, a cultural ideal of invested parenting may arguably make it more expensive still. Parenting choices, especially around expenditure on children, are imbued with vital meanings. Bandelj points to how increasingly, and perhaps across race and socio-economic categories, this meaning resides in parental identities as invested parents, and in assiduously preparing their children to become the human capital investment child. But do parents engage in this expensive process of raising a human capital investment child as nuclear units? The focus on parenting implicitly conceptualizes parental investments in children and the human capital investment child as taking place in a very nuclear family context consisting of two (probably married and heterosexual) parents with children. This conceptualization of a family, and the project of parental investments and raising a human capital investment child is, however, partial () Privileged parents in particular belong to a social class in which they often have access to layers of economic resources, including access to financial help from kin. Kin can sometimes function as a privatized form of insurance () especially for the affluent. Parents provide financial support to their children across the life-course, especially at pivotal moments such as purchasing a home () This is particularly so in recent years with the development of a new life-stageemerging adulthoodduring which middle-class parents seek to help adult children well into their 20s and early 30s () In the U.K. young adults who purchase homes in London, an expensive and increasingly out-of-reach financial goal, do so with help from \"the Bank of Mum and Dad\" () Young adults, aged 1830, who have parents in the top quarter of families receive on average $95,000 from their parents while those with parents in the bottom quarter receive on average $31,000 () Financial support from high-income parents to their adult children extends beyond support for basic needs and may be aimed at shoring up advantage () In the U.S. Whites are more likely than other groups to have privileged kin networks that can provide money, advice, and support in times of need () Disparities in initial wealth are compounded through the life-course (; ; ; ) with severe consequences for the racialization of wealth () Although much research assumes that parental expenses on children's education and enrichment activities are confined to the nuclear family, emerging research shows that wealth is transferred from grandparents to grandchildren () with the frequency and amounts of monetary gifts being highest in families in the higher socio-economic levels () Wealth may be transmitted intergenerationally in the form of inheritances, but importantly also inter vivos gifts that transfer significant monetary help to adult children (; ) But prior research, and Bandelj's focus on children as parental investments, has tended to view parenting practices as operating within a nuclear family, insufficiently regarding the role of kin (especially grandparents) in facilitating parental projects of raising a human capital investment child. My study on how U.S. families in the professional middle class parent during unemployment attuned me to the important role of kin, especially grandparents, in parenting projects.3 In my broader study, I was concerned with how relatively affluent, heterosexual U.S. families deal with a spouse's unemployment () For families of this social class, parenting is an expansive and expensive project and I was additionally interested in how they made decisions about what child-related goods, experiences and activities they would spend on and which they would cut back on given their altered financial state due to unemployment. As I explain elsewhere () families with an unemployed father practiced what I term relational preservation and families with an unemployed mother practiced what I term relational downscaling. Relational preservation means that parents in families with an unemployed father were tremendously concerned that their children would worry about the father's unemployment. To minimize this anticipated worry they decided to minimize any changes in child-related expenditure. Relational downscaling means that in families with an unemployed mother, parents were far less preoccupied with managing their children's worries and took a more matter-of-fact approach that some changes in child-related expenditures were necessary given maternal unemployment. One area that both types of families were reluctant to touch though, aligning with Bandelj's concept of the human capital investment child, were child-related educational expenses. As I point out in the article and expand upon in this response, throughout this process, kin, and especially grandparents, played an important role in enabling both strategies. In relational preservation, kin met the shortfall between child-related expenditure and family incomes given paternal unemployment. In relational downscaling, kin transferred financial help that enabled mothers to stay at home. Financial help from kin consolidated gendered ideals for how these families experiencing unemployment ought to organize their lives. What I explored less in the prior piece were the details of how financial help from grandparents was often quite important to parental projects of raising the human capital investment child. Here, I delve into these details. I would buy our groceries on my parent's Visa. I'm very close with them. My parents insisted that we use their Visa every time [we go out for dinner] So we'd go out like once every two weeks. Have sushi dinners with the kids, spend like $100 and it was on my parents. So their presence and their support afforded us this material lifestyle. Between the Levys and Rayan's parents, these exchanges are normalized because both sides view them as a transfer of wealth that would have occurred anyway, but which has simply been expedited. Rayan for example, explains that while the Levys are frugal, especially while Monica is unemployed, they have a sense of assurance about their financial well-being because of his parents. He says, \"Again, I'm not reckless with money at all, I don't spend anything. I don't go out. Very rarely go out with my friends.\" Anytime Monica brings up money concerns, Rayan responds \"'Well, that's fine. We'll make it. It'll be okay. We'll be fine.'I'm like, 'Just take it easy. We're going to be fine.'\" Rayan often tells Monica the following, \"I find myself telling her things like, 'Look, my parents have property. We're both only kids. My parents have property. Your parents have property. We own property.\" He adds, \"I go to the point where I'm telling her: these are the retirement money my parents have.' That comes to us at some point. I know it sounds awful, but they're all going to die at some point. Don't worry about these things.\" As Rayan explains, in his mind, his parents in particular are there as a financial resource for his family should they need it. They function, in that sense, as a form of privatized insurance which can be accessed when times get tough. And until times do get very tough, knowing that this resource is there provides a sense of emotional safety for Rayan. Their own parents were important in allowing parents experiencing unemployment to infuse a sense of joy in their children's lives. Kiara Eklund, who worked in the non-profit sector until she lost her job, has two young daughters under the age of five. Kiara says, \"My mom is here, so she helps out with the little things. Like instead of me having to purchase Bianca new clothes my mom will buy them.\" Indeed, grandparents often made small purchases for their grandchildren, and sometimes bigger ones like buying a teenager a pair of expensive UGG boots, while their children were unemployed. I found that grandparents often gifted experiences to their grandchildren while parents were unemployed. Eliot Frankel, whose wifewho earns double his annual salaryis unemployed, explains how they were able to continue going on vacations while she has been unemployed. He first describes how he and his wife have been cautious with their money, \"Some people go out to eat constantly, we weren't ever like that. We've scaled that back. I mean we certainly haven't done any clothes shopping or anything big like that.\" As he adds though, \"We didn't have to cut some big fun activity like that.\" This is because as he says, \"We've been very lucky. A lot of people cut back on trips. We take a lot of family vacations that [my parents] pay for.\" The Frankels take these vacations with Eliot's parents, in part so that his parents \"get more time with the grandkids.\" Children serve as a catalyst facilitating these transfers in order to cement family feelings intergenerationally. Eliot adds, \"We actually enjoy being with them and they take us on these great trips. So we were in Italy this summer.\" Smiling and shaking his head in disbelief he questions, \"Like who goes to Italy when you're out of work? It's crazy. And we would never do it. Other than the fact that we didn't pay for it, so why not?\" These grandparental gifts allow grandchildren to have joyful experiences even as their parents experience unemployment. Perhaps the most important role that grandparent's financial support takes during parental unemployment is in shoring up educational investments in children. As I note elsewhere () parents are most reluctant to make any cutbacks on child-related expenses. This is where monetary transfers from grandparents help immensely. An important expense for the Levys while Monica is searching for a tenure-track position is sending their daughter to a private elementary school. The Levys maintained this commitment only with help from both sets of parents. Rayan's parents pledged to pay for their daughter's private school, running at $1100 per month, until Monica finds a job. Monica concurs with Rayan, and says, \"We couldn't have afforded to send her to private school unless the grandparents helped.\" Rather than being loans or subsidies these injections of money that Rayan mentions receiving for their child's private schooling are understood by the Levys as part of their inheritance which has simply been expedited. Grandparents also help maintain investments aimed at grandchildren's future (often, quite far in the future) Nicole Lenoir is unemployed, and her income comprised half of her household's annual income. During this time, the Lenoirs have decreasedbut not stoppedthe contributions toward their 3-year old's anticipated college expenses. Although Nicole does not see this as ideal, she explains, \"But it's also okay because both sets of grandparents are saving for his college as well, so we might not even need loans.\" A similar process unfolded for the Eastons. Doug Easton has been unemployed for close to 2 years, and he brought in the lion's share of their household income. The Eastons' older daughter is now 2 years away from college. When their daughter expressed some concern about how the family would manage her college expenses, Doug's wife Alice says she responded in the following way, \"I just let her know that we had saved for that in advance and her grandparents made a contribution to her college fund so that we were able to try and help her.\" Doug, whose parents are the ones who have contributed to his children's college fund, details what this contribution entails, \"My dad had set up trust funds for both of my kids. I would say there's about a $150,000 each.There's not enough in each one to pay for college, but the vast majority of it.\" Similarly, Eileen Boyle, who is unemployed and earned close to three times what her husband did, has in-laws who are wealthy. They too have now pledged to contribute to her children's college-funds. She describes, \"It turns out my in-laws actually have a college fund set up for our kids too which we did not know about. And they've still not discussed it with us. So we don't know what kind of moneyhis mother said something like 'Well, all the kids have college funds.'\" Eileen is curious to know the details of the college fund so she can better plan what kinds of college her children may be able to accessstate level or private ones. She asked her husband, \"I said 'Well, did you talk to your brothers [about how much their kids received]?' His one brother's son just graduated. I said 'That could change everything that we're doing here.'\" Eileen is confident that there is a substantial amount of money earmarked for her kids' college expenses from her in-laws' estate, but is less sure about the specific value of this pot of money. My sister-in-law has been a nurse; this is my husband's sister. She's been a nurse for 30 years and she is just about to retire. She's been single and she's been kind of an influence on my daughter in terms of my daughter's desire to go into medicine and she's been very supportive of that. And so she would like to contribute toward my daughter's medical education or pre-medical education, so she had offered to pay $10,000 towards her [Ivy League] tuition because she knows my husband and I had been dealing with unemployment issues. As these parents are well aware, though, financial hardship on parentslike unemploymentcan improve the chances of receiving financial aid from universities (for more, see: ) So, Donna and her husband told Donna's sister-in-law the following, \"We asked her to not contribute until she graduates so as not to impact my daughter's financial aid status.\" The Mayrs and their daughter accepted this gift, but asked to delay it so that their daughter can use the $10,000 \"to reduce our daughter's loan balance after she graduates.\" Invested parenting may well be a response to several issues coalescing together such as increasing inequality that parallels the inequality of the Gilded Age, and economic upheaval and insecurity (Lin & Tobias ) In this context, as parents seek to equip their children with all that they consider necessary to thrive in their future, it is worth considering how, and which, parents are able to do so at all. In my study, the unemployed parents had access to resources from kin. The majority of my sample was white, which matters enormously for the ability to save and pass on wealth in the U.S. context. Their own relatives were able to help them meet the obligations they felt toward their children, especially in terms of present and future expensive educational obligations. Bandelj explains how invested parenting cuts across social class and race. Yet, similar aspirations, but different means to fulfilling them, will likely have repercussions for social inequalities in the future. The parenting strategies and ideologies of middle-class parents often have the potential to widennot lessensocial inequalities. Parents may not mean to broaden social inequalities, but privileged parents doing the best they can for their children nonetheless often have that impact. For example, concerted cultivation () equips middle class kids to successfully navigate institutions to their advantage, and implicitly at a cost to students from a working class origin. Invested parenting, even if aspired to by parents across race and social class categories, may only be within the reach of some parents. As Bandelj points out, the inequalities in subsequent generations seem inevitable. This should be a wake-up call for politicians and social policy architects. So much of life, so much of childhood, is getting individualized, siloed, privatized. The sense of a common good and plentiful opportunities for generations seem so alien in these visions of childhood and parenting. Instead of parents scrambling to do all they can to ensure their children have a chance at an enjoyable life, kin stepping in to provide resources to uphold this vision, it is worth asking where the state institutions that can scaffold some of these basic dreams are: higher education that does not cost an arm and a leg, decent jobs with decent pay, some security during hard times. Parents have had to do all too much, and invested parenting is the latest facet of that. Perhaps it is now time for the village to step up. I would like to thank Rebecca Elliot for her editorial eye and Nina Bandelj for her generative lecture and thoughtful response in this volume.

    "173": "Land grant universities were established to serve the common good by educating the citizenry of each state. Public higher education holds out the promise of creating opportunity and transforming society by letting talent and hard work prevail over economic and social circumstances. But the students who enroll and graduate from land grant research universities come mostly from the dominant culture. Their families have middle-class incomes or better and their parents hold college degrees. Even after doing equally well in high school, students from underrepresented populations, students from low-income families and first-generation college students start out at a disadvantage. Although land grant colleges started with men in mind, today more than half the nation's students are women. Yet women outnumber men among Americans living in poverty, overall and within every racial or ethnic group. More than half the families in poverty are headed by single women. Higher education offers their best hope to transform their lives, but universities are least accessible to those who need them most. It's not just a matter of economics, although that's a significant factor. Academic capital refers to the individual, social and cultural factors that promote academic success. At the Women in Educational Leadership Conference sponsored by the University of Nebraska Lincoln in October 2011, Renee Rodriguez Batman and Dr. Rachelle Winkle-Wagner spoke about academic capital formation (ACF) in relation to educational opportunity and the goal of expanding access to education. Why are some groups continually over-privileged? asked Winkle-Wagner, an assistant professor of educational leadership at Nebraska and Batman's dissertation advisor. Her answer is that high income and social status pass from parent to child, resulting in far less social mobility than Americans would like to believe. Upper-income families take a college education for granted, reproducing rather than transforming the social order. Costs are high and getting higher, with tuition rising faster than inflation. Although government aid is available, the current trend is to cut back on needs-based Pell grants in favor of student loans that are not based on need, and tax breaks that primarily benefit the well-to-do. Today Americans collectively owe more on student loans than on credit cards. Debt can be most frightening to students with life experience of poverty and no family financial safety net. But the human capital of a college education brings financial benefits that eventually outweigh the costs. The recent unemployment rate among college graduates is less than half that of high school graduates. By some estimates a college graduate can expect $1 million more in lifetime earnings than a worker without a degree. Women graduates lifetime earnings are much lower than men's, but still they are double those of women who didn't go to college. Admissions reflect social capital, starting with where and how to apply. The signature on a letter of recommendation can make the difference between acceptance and a wait list. Nearly three-quarters of selective research universities give legacy preference to applicants whose parents went there, mostly affluent whites. Trust, responsibility and social obligations are all parts of the social capital that can help students to make their way through college. Knowing the right people can help them navigate the system, including which courses to take, how to choose a major and how to deal with classism, sexism and racism. All the benefits a student gets from her social networks add up to her social capital. Cultural capital is intangible, involving not just knowledge and skills but assumptions absorbed over time. It includes perceptions, aspirations and cultural values. Habitus, or dispositions and ways of thought, is formed in the family and influences what courses of action seem viable. Cultural and familial expectations of women in terms of college, career, sibling care and motherhood can have a big effect on student success in higher education. Within an ethnic culture this can vary greatly by family. Family uplift refers to support from a family that encourages college attendance and the expansion of education from one generation to the next. Mothers of young children and especially single parents may depend heavily on supportive families to meet the day-to-day needs of childcare. In Breaking Through the Access Barrier: How Academic Capital Formation Can Improve Policy in Higher Education () Edward St. John proposed using ACF theory to evaluate policies, mandates, funding decisions and interventions in relation to the goal of expanding student access. Faculty's perspective is one piece that's missing in the access puzzle, said Renee Rodriguez Batman, director of academic administration at UNL and a PhD candidate in educational studies. Her dissertation research explores faculty perceptions of competing demands and their effects at one Midwestern land grant university. The Morrill Act of 1862 established land grant colleges to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts [not excluding other fields] in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life. The public purpose to educate the industrial classes was built into the text of the act. Nearly 150 years later, many land grant colleges have become top research universities while retaining their initial mission. That could provoke an identity crisis anywhere. Unusual changes are highlighting identity challenges at the university where she did her research. It joined the Big Ten athletic conference last year but lost its membership in the Association of American Universities soon afterward, making it the only Big Ten member not in the AAU. Trying to regain its standing among research universities, stay financially stable and expand student access in underserved populations has brought long-standing issues to the fore. Trying to be everything to everybody is a strain, and first-generation college students pay much of the price. In a qualitative pilot study, Batman interviewed four senior administrators and four tenured or tenure-track faculty. She selected them purposefully to get multiple perspectives. All of the faculty participants and half of the administrators began their academic careers as first-generation college students. She's exploring whether ACF theory is a useful framework to analyze her data and guide the next phase of research, when she expands to 30 or 40 interviewees. Her pilot interviews probed participants perceptions of competing demands (research, prestige, money, access) and their effects on student success. She asked them about the role of taxpayers in providing educational access. Participants viewed expanding opportunity as not only a social good but an obligation. Are we the good life and who has the good life? How does that good life operate for different groups of people? That is what we contribute. To me that is the most important complement of higher education, a woman administrator told her. All educators are in the process of helping to grow generations and I look at that as the most important thing that can be done in human endeavor. Federal policies have long supported access to higher education as a public good, starting in 1862 with the Morrill Act. More recently needs-based federal Pell grants, introduced in 1972, paid a maximum of $1,400 per student in 1976 (the first year the program was fully funded) and covered 72% of tuition at a typical four-year public university. Today the maximum annual grant is $5,550, meeting slightly more than a third of the cost. In today's worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, Pell grants are under attack in Congress and state university budgets are tight or shrinking. Budget cuts and tuition increases threaten the academic capital formation of students who need it most. Though the state where she did the study has a fairly stable commitment to its university system, recent changes highlight questions of self-image and bring out long-standing issues. The land grant university has as its principle, service to the state, however that's defined not service to current budget demands, one survey participant told her. Tenured faculty in her study took a big-picture approach; those without tenure looked back more on their own first-generation experience, perhaps still feeling that they were fighting the odds. Admissions criteria and standardized test scores also came up in the interviews. Like other policies and practices, they favor students who have the most human, social and cultural capital in the first place. That makes university education a way to keep most students in the social class into which they were born. To encourage college as a path to social mobility will require intentional changes. The most important thing is to set goals and priorities with some kind of bottom-up approach. Then you need buy-in so you know where you're going, Batman said. Academic capital formation is a way to get people into the academy, to transform society. Batman: Winkle-Wagner:",

Explains that Kenya and Tanzania, with their similar colonial background, resources, and economic structure, but markedly divergent educational policies, constitute a natural experiment. Obtains measures of both reasoning ability and cognitive skill from surveys of representative samples of urban wage employees, allowing the development of a model to evaluate the human capital, screening, and credentialist interpretations of the link between educational attainment and earnings. Evaluates competing explanations for the steeper earnings-experience profile of the more educated. Estimates the effects of country differences in the quantity and quality education on output. Analyzes occupation as an important intermediary between education and earnings. Isolates the effect that institutional intervention by the government has on the wage structure. Measures the responsiveness of the wages of secondary and primary leavers to changes in their relative supply. Examines how levels of inequality change in response to changes in the composition of the workforce that result from educational expansion. Considers the equality of the distribution of school places in Kenya and Tanzania. Explores whether the expansion of secondary enrollment in Kenya, and the contrasting situation in Tanzania, have affected the degree of intergenerational mobility and the process of class formation. Examines methodological and policy issues in the cost-benefit analysis and in the financing of secondary education. Considers the implications of the findings for future research and the extent to which the results can be generalized to other countries and situations.

    "183": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to question the frequently heard claims of a negative relationship between inequality and intergenerational mobility (such as the Great Gatsby Curve by Alan Krueger) and to propose entrepreneurship as the neglected prime countervailing force against the putative advantages of the rich. Design/methodology/approach A critical examination of evidences marshalled to support the case for a negative relationship between inequality and mobility, in terms of the appropriateness of statistical inferences and the consistency between implications and observations. The paper adopts alternative approach of Austrian economic in emphasizing the role of entrepreneurship in generating mobility. Findings The putative negative relationship between inequality and mobility is not supported by evidence. The result is partly that egalitarians tend to skip close examination when they run into evidence that seems to support their preconception. It is also partly that the dominant tradition in economics, based on the model of efficient allocation of given resources, induces them to overlook entrepreneurship, the prime wealth creator and generator of mobility. Research limitations/implications The research outlines an argument that the rich do not have advantage in entrepreneurship because it depends not on the ownership of currently valued resources, but on the discovery and exploitation of profitable opportunities. This claim is made based on Kirznerian perspective and authors own theory of inference and learning process. However, it would be nice to able to provide empirical evidence of this claim made in the paper. Social implications Many policies of redistribution, based on the belief that increase in inequality (as measured by Gini coefficient) signifies a diminution of intergenerational mobility, should be re-examined since the alleged negative relationship between inequality and intergenerational mobility turns out to be untrue. For greater intergenerational mobility, entrepreneurs should be encouraged, by allowing them to experiment freely. Originality/value Emphasizing the role of entrepreneurship in intergenerational mobility and the dealing with the question of whether or not the rich would have advantage in entrepreneurship is original to this paper.",
    "185": "We develop a quantitative theory of human capital with heterogeneous agents in order to assess the sources of cross-country income differences. The cross-sectional implications of the theory and U.S. data are used to restrict the parameters of human capital technology. We then assess the model's ability to explain the cross-country data. Our quantitative model generates a total-factor-productivity (TFP) elasticity of output per worker of 2.8. This implies that a factor of 3 difference in TFP is amplified through physical and human capital accumulation to generate a factor of 20 difference in output per worker --- as observed in the data between rich and poor countries. The implied difference in TFP is in the range of estimates from micro studies. The theory suggests that using Mincer returns to measure human capital understates human capital differences across countries by a factor of 2. The cross-country differences in human capital implied by the theory are consistent with evidence from earnings of immigrants in the United States. We also find that TFP has substantial effects on cross-sectional inequality and intergenerational mobility and that public education policies can have important aggregate and distributional implications.",
    "191": "Money parents give their adult children may be important for the financing of a child's education or a first home, relaxing binding credit constraints or responding to a transitory income shock. Financial transfers however, may extend economic disparities across generations if the wealthy transfer considerable resources to their children while middle class and poor households do not. In this paper, the authors first examine annual gifts of money from parents to adult children in the United States and ten European countries using the 2004 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) Second, utilizing the long panel of the HRS, the authors study the long-run behavior of parental monetary giving to children across families and within a family. This paper found that in all countries, some parents gave money to children, many did not, the amount was low, about 500 Euros annually per child, and varied by parental socio-economic status and public social expenditures. In the short-term parents in the U.S. gave money to a child to compensate for low earnings or satisfy an immediate need such as schooling. Over sixteen years, parents gave an average of about $38,000 to all their children, five percent gave over $140,000 and gave persistently. With time, the amount of money children in the same family received became more equal and a child's level of education was one of the few remaining sources of differences in money given to children. Overall, the annual amount of money parents gave adult children in any country was not enough to affect the distribution of resources within or between families in the next generation although the timing of transfers for schooling or housing may have a significant impact on an individual child. Annual parental transfers for college age children in school in the U.S. were substantially higher than average transfers to all children. The effect of parental transfers for higher education on intergenerational mobility in the U.S. will depend in part upon whether this financing is essential in the schooling decision.",
    "196": "This testimony makes three main points. First, inheritances tend to exacerbate existing economic disparities and may be the most important barrier to intergenerational economic mobility.

    "206": "We analyze how the introduction of habits and aspirations affects the distribution of wealth when the labor productivity of individuals is subject to idiosyncratic shocks and when bequests arise from a joyofgiving motive. In the presence of either bequests or aspirations, labor income shocks are transmitted intergenerationally, and this transmission, together with contemporaneous shocks, determines the distribution of wealth. We show that the introduction of aspirations (habits) decreases (increases) the average wealth, and increases (decreases) both its intragenerational variability and the degree of intergenerational mobility. Therefore, a distinction between aspirations and habits is relevant because they involve different implications for the distribution of wealth.",
    "207": "We study the role of parental wealth for children's educational and occupational outcomes across three types of welfare states and outline a theoretical model that assumes parental wealth to impact offspring's attainment through two mechanisms, wealth's purchasing function and its insurance function. We argue that welfare states can limit the purchasing function of wealth, for instance by providing free education and generous social benefits, yet none of the welfare states examined here provides a functional equivalent to the insurance against adverse outcomes afforded by parental wealth. Our empirical evidence of substantial associations between parental wealth and children's educational success and social mobility in three nations that are marked by large institutional differences is in line with this interpretation and helps us re-examine and extend existing typologies of mobility regimes.",
    "209": "This paper proposes a unified framework for the analysis of inequalities. In contrast to the former literature on inequalities, housing is included as a major determinant of individual saving behavior. Disparities across locations affect individual outcomes in both labor and education markets. In a Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari type model where several frictions are represented, the model allows for segmentation between homeowners and renters in the housing market, imperfection in the capital market and residential mobility over the life-cycle. Moreover, individual location is assumed to affect labor productivity, wealth accumulation via the dynamics of housing prices and the human capital acquisition process of the next generation. The dynamics of prices combined to bequest motive provide the perfect framework to understand the tenure choice of individuals. Furthermore, the fixity of housing supply in each neighborhood combined with borrowing constraints prevent some households from living in their preferred area, which leads to segregation. Using this general framework, the paper contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between labor, housing and education markets. Finally, several experiments aimed at decreasing the level of inequalities at the individual and location level are provided.",

Post F ordist and neoliberal restructuring have reshaped urban labour markets, resulting in growing inequalities that disproportionately afflict younger workers. This article empirically analyses the transition as experienced in M ontreal and V ancouver, two C anadian cities that have undergone restructuring in different ways. The study of young adults' changing incomes reveals growing intra and intercohort inequality, and an increasing intergenerational income gap in both cities. Income inequality is greater in V ancouver, with its more pronounced post F ordist labour force composition and neoliberalized governance context. Known factors such as occupation and gender affect the earnings structure, but educational attainment has increased the most in terms of its effect on incomes. Inequalities among young adults are expected to magnify in the future due to unevenness in educational attainment. Urban research ought to pay close attention to the role of education in structuring inequalities, and the ways the impact of restructuring is unevenly distributed across generations.",

We estimate a multilevel model considering both individual and countrylevel controls to explain individual perception of unequal opportunity. Our estimates suggest that the two most adopted measures of inequality of opportunity have no clear role in explaining its perception. Conversely, other countrylevel variables and personal experiences of intergenerational social mobility are important determinants of how inequality of opportunity is perceived.",

Poverty is discussed not only in terms of wage earnings, but also in relation to employment conditions, social challenges that pile up together with income poverty, and intergenerational mobility. The paper finds that notwithstanding improvements in early decades, after fifty years, the problems of a social divide and poverty have come full circle. Social policy in Singapore retains its fundamentally productivist philosophical orientation, but the recent deterioration in poverty, inequality and mobility trends is leading to adoption of more welfare-oriented and universalist policy solutions. Social inclusion is now a national priority, and policy redirection for the future needs to take place in wide-ranging policy domains, including the labor market and economic growth.",

We find that inheritances reduce relative wealth inequality (e.g. the Gini coefficient falls by 510 percent) but that absolute dispersion increases. Examining different parts of the wealth distribution, we find that the top decile's wealth share decreases substantially, whereas the wealth share of the bottom half increases from a negative to a positive share. In essence, wealthier heirs inherit larger amounts, but less wealthy heirs inherit more relative to their pre-inheritance wealth. We also find that post-inheritance behavioral adjustments mitigate the equalizing effect of inheritances because less wealthy heirs consume larger shares of their inheritances. Moreover, we find that the Swedish inheritance tax reduced the equalizing inheritance effect but that the redistribution of tax revenues could reverse this result. Finally, we show that inheritances increase wealth mobility.",

Mexican Americans who achieve extreme rates of intergenerational mobility straddle class and ethnic contexts, a position that is accompanied by a set of challenges that are unique to middle-class minorities. Socially mobile Mexican Americans retain an enduring familiarity with poverty and must manage intra-class relations with poorer coethnics, who often request financial and social support. As they enter white professional milieus, they must also manage interethnic relations with whites who do not view them as bona fide members of the white middle class. These challenges reinforce class and ethnic boundaries and lead middle-class Mexican Americans who grow up disadvantaged to adopt a minority culture of mobility that manifests through group-specific mobility strategies embedded in ethnic communities, such as creating and joining ethnic professional organizations.",
    "236": "In explaining the demographic transition Caldwell in a series of papers has given singular importance to a change in the direction of intrafamily intergenerational transfers and an associated shift in parental motivations to bear and rear children from economic to psychic advantages which accompanies socioeconomic development and modernization. In 2 recent papers this author initiated a longterm project with the goal of constructing an economic theory of the demographic transition. Early work on this project has several parallels with Caldwells theory and with an independent statement of a similar view by Ryder. The work also emphasized the connection between fertility and the intergenerational distribution of income and consumption within the family and attempts to trace the mechanisms by which socioeconomic development may lead to fertility transition. This paper represents both a summary and extension of the recent work and related theoretical literature with emphasis on its application to demographic transition theory. The main substantive conclusions follow from the assumption that modern economic development is driven by sustained technological change that is translated into growth in real income via investments in human and physical capital. At a given rate of population growth a rise in the productivity of human and physical capital due to improved technology increases the mean age at which it is optimal for an individual to produce his/her lifetime wealth relative to the age at which lifetime wealth is consumed in steady state. This in turn tends to shift the steady state direction of net intergenerational transfers from a situation in which the young transfer to the old under primitive technological conditions to a situation in which the old transfer to the young with more advanced technology. In the former case a rise in population growth increases per capita wealth and welfare and in the latter case it reduces them. The author concludes his reexamination of the Caldwell hypothesis by advancing an alternative version that reverses the line of causation that he emphasizes and instead emphasizes the crucial role that the family and particularly parental altruism plays in the process of economic development. A purely self interested older generation refuses to reduce its consumption either directly of indirecly via intermediary institutions that operate in impersonal private markets because the benefits of the investment are reaped by the younger generation after the older generation is dead. On the other hand an older generation of altruistic parents considers the success of their sons and daughters as a substitute for their own success.",

The model shows that a larger redistribution improves equality and utility and enhances mobility when the poor are financially constrained, however it creates a trade-off between the rich and the poor in terms of utility when the poor are financially unconstrained. The model also shows that the size of the redistribution as well as wage inequality play key roles in explaining the cross-country differences in inequality and mobility among OECD countries.",

In 1315, at the height of Venetian economic influence, wealthy Venetians put 'a formal stop to social mobility with the publication of the Libro D'Oro, or Book of Gold, an official registry of the Venetian nobility. If you weren't on it, you couldn't join the ruling oligarchy' () The Venetians called the change La Serrata (The Closure) and within decades a potential democracy became an oligarchy, and economic and social opportunities were closed to all newcomers. As Freeland notes, by 1500 Venice's population was smaller than it was in 1330, and it continued to shrink in the 17th and 18th centuries while the rest of Europe grew.By the end of Greg Duncan and Richard Murnane's edited book, Whither Opportunity? Rising Inequality, Schools, and Children's Life Chances, it is easy to worry that America's own version of the Closure has already begun. In this landmark book, 25 chapters by leading psychologists, economists, and public policy experts focus on the fundamental and ongoing economic changes affecting children's educational opportunities, performance, and likely job trajectories. The conclusions of these authors are complex, sometimes contradictory, and even encouraging at times (e.g. African-American students and young women have recently experienced some substantial academic gains) Overall, however, American income inequality is growing and, as many of these chapters reveal, family income is increasingly predictive of children's educational opportunities and attainments. Social class matters more than ever, and unfortunately Americans are not very good at thinking about class. In their introductory chapter, Duncan and Murnane provide a summary of recent changes in the income and educational opportunities that underlie nearly all of the remaining chapters of the book. The authors begin by describing figure 1 as an illustration of the economic changes in the last 60 plus years of American history. Put simply, inflation-adjusted income for the poorest 20% of Americans nearly doubled from 1947 to 1978 but has remained almost flat for the past 30 years. By contrast, for the wealthiest 20% real income also doubled from 1947 to 1978 but then continued to grow by another one third or more up until 2008. As Robert Reich [2010] aptly described this development, the period from about 1947 to1978 could be called Great Prosperity and from about 1980 to now, the Great Regression. Of course, the full story of growing American income inequality is much more troubling than Duncan and Murnane have room to explore. Figures from the Congressional Budget Office [2011] reveal that income for the wealthiest 20% (minus the top 1%) grew about 50% from 1978 to 2008, whereas real income growth for the wealthiest 1% grew slightly less than 300% (with 660% growth for the top 0.01% of the wealthiest []; see Atkinson, Piketty, & Saez [2011] for more historical data) Although the economic downturn of 2008 had a significant impact on the wealthiest Americans, Stiglitz [2012] and other economists have found that an amazing 93% of all income gains in the recovery year of 2010 went to the wealthiest 1% of all Americans. The larger point for Duncan and Murnane and many economists is not the existence of income inequality per se. The rich were much richer than the poor both at the beginning and end of the Great Prosperity (1947-1978) The relative gaps between income groups, however, did not get any greater; all income groups saw comparable income growth during this period. The economic story of the past 30 years is the increasing growth of income inequality as the gap between the rich and poor keeps growing wider. And as Whither Opportunity makes clear, the growth of income inequality has had profound effects on the educational opportunities and life chances of American children. After describing the growth of income inequality in their introductory chapter, Duncan and Murnane lay the foundation for subsequent chapters by discussing how that income inequality increasingly affects the educational experiences and opportunities of Americans. One central change is that education has been more closely related to income in the past 30 years than it was during the Great Prosperity. The authors note that between 1977 and 2007 inflation-adjusted wages grew 1% for high school graduates, 25% for college graduates, and actually declined 13% for high school dropouts. And, Duncan and Murnane continue, at the same time that income became more closely linked with education, educational mobility (especially for men) declined. Before 1970, fewer than 10% of young American adults had completed less schooling than their parents, whereas by 1990 20% of American men, and nearly as many women, had completed less schooling than their parents. As a result, intergenerational income and educational social mobility are now greater in most European countries than they are in the United States [; Hertz et al. 2008].High school graduation rates have not budged in the last thirty-five years, and the slow growth we have seen in college graduation rates has been due almost entirely to children from middle-class and affluent families Just how increased income inequality influences the skill acquisition and educational attainment of children born into different circumstances is, of course, a much more complicated question and one that consumes the bulk of our volume. [ pp. 6-7]In the remaining book chapters, leading experts examine 'The Developing Child and Adolescent' (Part II, 6 chapters) 'The Family' (Part III, 4 chapters) 'Neighborhoods' (Part IV, 2 chapters) 'Labor Markets' (Part V, 2 chapters) and 'Schools' (Part VI, 10 chapters) Collectively, these different sections provide an emerging picture of what Duncan and Murnane argue is a central dilemma of our time. Compared with most other advanced countries, Americans have always been willing to tolerate a relatively high level of income inequality as long as opportunities for social mobility were also seen as high and relatively fairly distributed. As a nation, we seem much more concerned with equality of opportunity than equality of outcomes. Moreover, Duncan and Murnane claim, Americans believe in relying on schools to level the playing field and promote equal opportunities. But can schools really play this role today? 'Or has growing income inequality affected families, neighborhoods, and local labor markets in a manner that undercuts the effectiveness of schools serving disadvantaged populations? This is the question at the heart of this project' [ ] The remainder of this review focuses on a few key book chapters that both present tentative answers to this question and illustrate the unique intellectual power of this volume.Sean Reardon begins his chapter (chapter 5, 'The Widening Achievement Gap between the Rich and the Poor: New Evidence and Possible Explanations') 'As the income gap between high- and low-income families has widened, has the achievement gap between children in high- and low-income families also widened? The answer, in brief, is yes' [ ] Reardon's longer answer in this chapter is, of course, much more elaborate, but the overall story is strikingly consistent with that initial 'yes.' The chapter draws on data from 19 nationally representative samples that included specific tests of children's reading and/or math abilities (with study birth cohorts beginning in 1945) as well as information about parental income, educational level, and occupational status. Many of the subsequent analyses address differences in average reading and math scores of children from families who are in the 90th percentile of income distribution (about USD 160,000 in 2008) versus children whose families are in the 10th percentile group (about USD 17,500 in 2008) In addition, however, Reardon also compares test score results for black and white children. Two major sets of findings emerge, and one is surprisingly positive: in the past 50 years, differences in black and white test scores have narrowed substantially, although much of this change (especially for reading scores) emerged in cohorts born before 1975. By contrast, the gap in higher- and lower-income children's school achievement (i.e. combined reading and math scores) has increased by more than one third in just over two decades. In concrete terms, the average reading scores of middle school children from poorer families are now more than 3 years lower than the scores of children from wealthier families (i.e. 10 vs. 90% income brackets) - a difference that has nearly doubled since the earliest studies. Reardon's tentative explanations for the increasing effects of income inequality on children's academic performance foreshadow many of the arguments made in subsequent book chapters. For example, one of his final analyses reveals that especially, in families above the national income median (about USD 50,000 in 2008) increased income is now more strongly related to children's academic achievement than it was just a few decades ago. Moreover, this growing gap is not related to parental education. In other words, income per se, and not parental education, is playing a greater role in the increasing gaps in children's academic performance. The exact meaning of this emerging pattern is unclear, although Reardon suggests that families may be changing the ways in which they spend income and time to promote their children's cognitive development. As Reardon explains:At the same time that family income has become more predictive of children's academic achievement, so have educational attainment and cognitive skills become more predictive of adults' earnings As the children of the rich do better in school, and those who do better in school are more likely to become rich, we risk producing an even more unequal and economically polarized society. [ ]A revealing figure at the beginning of the book illustrates inflation-adjusted changes in what parents spent on children's enrichment activities (e.g. books, computers, and summer camps) beginning in 1972 up to 2006. In 1972, the child-related expenditures for the top income quintile was about USD 2,700 greater than the bottom income quintile. By 2006, however, that difference had nearly tripled to more than USD 7,500. Perhaps more tellingly, annual child expenditures in the bottom quintile remained nearly unchanged from 1983 to 2006, while they increased more than 50% in that period for the wealthiest quintile. In their chapter on this topic (chapter 9, 'How is family income related to investments in children's learning') Neeraj Kaushal, Katherine Magnuson, and Jane Waldfogel expand on these findings using information from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, 'a repeated cross-sectional survey that contains detailed data on family income and expenditures' [Kaushal, Magnuson, & ] Not surprisingly, the authors find that the wealthiest income quintile substantially outspends poorer families in every category of enrichment expenditures, including books and magazines, computers, sports, trips, and electronics. More detailed analyses, however, reveal that as family budgets increase even slightly, spending on noncollege tuition (e.g. private schools) daycare, and the single largest category, family trips, increases more than spending on other child expenditures. Maternal education also plays a key role as more educated mothers use more of any increases in family income on child enrichment than their less educated peers. Meredith Phillips describes a related pattern in her chapter (chapter 10, 'Parenting, time use, and disparities in academic outcomes') where she uses nationally representative data to examine how parents spend time with their children. The author finds that between children's birth and age 6, higher-income parents (top economic quintile) spend 1,300 more hours with their children in nonroutine contexts than lower-income parents (bottom economic quintile) Furthermore, during the 2 focal days of the survey, nearly 40% of higher-income parents versus 20% of lower-income parents read to their young children at least once. Phillips [2011] underscores the importance of these differences by noting that: The most enduring and consistent finding in the time-use literature is that reading to young children is positively associated with children's verbal skills [with] estimates that about a third of the association between parental reading and the cognitive skills of toddlers is causal. ()Not surprisingly, the cumulative consequences of these and other changes described in Whither Opportunity extend well beyond children's elementary and secondary years. In chapter 6 ('Inequality in postsecondary education') for example, Martha Bailey and Susan Dynarski use census data and findings from several major longitudinal studies to track changes in college entry and graduation over a 70-year period. In that time, college graduation rates have quadrupled, with 28% of children born in 1975 graduating from college by age 25. This major increase in college graduation rates, however, varied greatly by income group: 'increases were highly uneven, with gains largest at the top of the income distribution and smallest at the bottom' [ ] For example, looking at children born in the early 1980s, 54% from the top income quartile graduated from college compared with 9% from the bottom quartile. The authors conclude with two other equally troubling patterns. First, less than one third of lower-income students who started college graduated compared with a two-thirds college completion rate for higher-income children. And second, 'Even among those who as teenagers had the same measured cognitive skills, inequality in college entry and completion across income groups is greater today than it was two decades ago' [ ] The majority of the chapters in Whither Opportunity address how recent, sweeping changes in income inequality are affecting children's educational and subsequent occupational opportunities. Fortunately, several other chapters (especially in the last section on schools) describe some specific programs that can successfully alter the typical educational trajectories of many low-income children. Some of these programs, like the HighScope Perry preschool intervention, date back almost 50 years, and the questions they raise about the processes that underlie life success are still being debated [see, for example, chapter 3, 'The nature and impact of early achievement skills, attention skills, and behavior problems,' by ] Other programs, like the Harlem Children's Zone [see chapter 23, 'It may not take a village: increasing achievement among the poor,' by Curto, Fryer, & ] have shown that combining extensive after-school programs and community services with high-quality charter school can successfully close 'the gap between poor minority students and the average white student in New York City public schools' [Curto et al. 2011, ].These important programs, and the debates they raise regarding the relative influence of cognitive versus noncognitive and school versus community resources deserve their own books [see, for example, ] and book reviews. Moreover, it is clear, after reading the state-of-the-art chapters in Whither Opportunity, that researchers and educators, as well as parents and other adults are making enormous efforts to understand - and alter - the unequal life opportunities that many American children will face. Yet, by the end of this book, it is almost impossible not to come back full circle to where Duncan and Murnane started in their initial chapter, income inequality.If growing American income inequality is at the heart of many of the negative educational changes described in this book, then reversing that inequality is clearly an essential step in improving children's life chances. But how is it possible even to begin such a politically and economically overwhelming task? Although there are no simple answers to this type of question, Darling-Hammond [2010] provides an initial response in her already influential book, The Flat World and Education: How America's Commitment to Equity Will Determine Our Future:International studies continue to confirm that the U.S. educational system is also one of the most unequal in terms of inputs. In contrast to European and Asian countries that fund schools centrally and equally, the wealthiest school districts in the United States spend nearly 10 times more than the poorest, and spending ratios of more than 3 to 1 are common within states [emphasis added] This creates huge inequalities in educational outcomes that ultimately weaken the very fabric of our nation. ()It would be unfair, however, to end a review of this amazing book by implying that it somehow fails to offer solutions for the underlying problem of growing income inequality. In fact, it was only at the end of this book that I had any real idea of the historic economic and educational forces that are making the life chances of America's children increasingly unequal. Whither Opportunity is one of those books that, like Harrington's [1962] The Other America: Poverty in the United States, has the potential to change our national dialogue about what 'equality of opportunity' really means. It is a book that psychologists, policy researchers, parents, and anyone interested in America's next generation will find thought provoking and disturbing.",

We consider a model of equilibrium short-period financial contracts, where poor agents face credit constraints owing to moral hazard and limited liability. If agents have no bargaining power, poor agents have no incentive to save: poverty traps emerge and agents are polarized into two classes, with no interclass mobility. If instead agents have all the bargaining power, strong saving incentives are generated: the wealth of poor and rich agents alike drift upward indefinitely and history does not matter eventually.",
    "252": "A bstract Private transfers of income between family members have had significant equalizing effects on the distribution of income in the United States but only recently have they become a subject of research and an element of analysis. Some of the major theoretical developments in the area of income distribution and intergenerational mobility in the rich literature of the grants economy are reviewed. Among the effects of family transfers on income distribution, the most critical considerations in intrafamily transfers, tentative results indicate, are those that relate, directly or indirectly, to investments in children during their formative years. Estimates of the size of family transfers include one that in a single year their total was of the magnitude of 30.7 percent of gross national product and another that in 1980 they were 70 percent of total transfers, amounting at least to 1 trillion. Trends in their level and structure are projected.",
    "256": "next are a major cause of inequality in general and of the unequal distribution of wealth in particular. Despite the popularity, not to say antiquity, of this view, surprisingly little is known about the nature and extent of these transfers (here called bequests, but interpreted to include gifts inter vivos) or about their motivation. Similarly, models of saving and accumulation have tended to be somewhat cavalier about bequests, either assuming them away altogether or treating them in an ad hoc fashion, for example, by tacking an arbitrary of on to a life-cycle model. It seems more satisfactory to derive bequest behaviour as part of the solution to some more general optimum problem. The most obvious framework for this approach is one in which individuals are altruistically motivated with respect to their children, and will choose to make bequests if, for example, they expect that the children would otherwise have markedly lower lifetime consumption than their own. Recently, several models of this dynastic-consumption equalizing type have been constructed (e.g. ; 1979; ) In each case the intention of the models is to explore the functional dependence of the equilibrium distributions of wealth and consumption on the distribution of lifetime earnings. This paper is in that tradition. The present model is designed to study how the inter-generational transmission of inequality is affected by inter-generational earnings mobility, asymmetry between positive and negative bequests, the strength of parental altruism, the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption and the return on wealth. The paper also examines whether the predictions generated by a model of this type are broadly consistent with what is actually observed. The first two considerations pose particular problems of analysis. Inequality may be transmitted by transfers of human wealth as well as by transfers of the material kind, and these two mechanisms are interrelated. Unless intergenerational mobility is perfect there will be some inter-generational link in earnings; hence high-earning individuals will choose a level of bequests in the expectation that their children may themselves be relatively high earners. The interesting question concerns how sensitive the wealth distribution is to different degrees of inter-generational earnings mobility. The sources of that mobility are, in the present analysis, less important than its extent, subject at least to the assumption that individuals cannot much alter the latter by manipulating the former. In what follows it is assumed that transfers of human wealth are entirely unplanned while those of material wealth are entirely planned.' The asymmetry between positive and negative bequests has two aspects. Suppose it seems desirable to an individual that some degree of consumption equalization takes place, but that this involves transfers to him from his children. Can he make a negative bequest? In general he can do so only with the active",

The evidence suggests that assortative mating tends to heighten inequalities when it is accompanied by couple similarities in labor supply and earnings capacity. An equalizing effect of womens employment will primarily emerge when lower educated womens labor supply increases rapidly. In the second part of the article, the author adopts a dynamic perspective, focusing on intergenerational mobility. Mothers employment is positive for childrens life chances because it minimizes poverty risks. And if external child care is of high quality, maternal employment has no negative effects on child outcomes. The rise in female employment may therefore also help diminish the reproduction of inequalities.",

    "283": "[See more from this special section on inequality][1] In 2011, the wrath of the 99% kindled Occupy movements around the world. The protests petered out, but in their wake an international conversation about inequality has arisen, with tens of thousands of speeches, articles, and blogs engaging everyone from President Barack Obama on down. Ideology and emotion drive much of the debate. But increasingly, the discussion is sustained by a tide of new data on the gulf between rich and poor. This special issue uses these fresh waves of data to explore the origins, impact, and future of inequality around the world. Archaeological and ethnographic data are revealing how inequality got its start in our ancestors (see pp. [822][2] and [824][3]) New surveys of emerging economies offer more reliable estimates of people's incomes and how they change as countries develop (see p. [832][4]) And in the past decade in developed capitalist nations, intensive effort and interdisciplinary collaborations have produced large data sets, including the compilation of a century of income data and two centuries of wealth data into the World Top Incomes Database (WTID) (see p. [826][5] and Piketty and Saez, p. [838][6]) It is only a slight exaggeration to liken the potential usefulness of this and other big data sets to the enormous benefits of the Human Genome Project. Researchers now have larger sample sizes and more parameters to work with, and they are also better able to detect patterns in the flood of data. Collecting data, organizing it, developing methods of analysis, extracting causal inferences, formulating hypothesesall of this is the stuff of science and is more possible with economic data than ever before. Even physicists have jumped into the game, arguing that physical laws may help explain why inequality seems so intractable (see p. [828][7]) ![Figure][8] PHOTO: STEVE RAYMER/CORBIS In the United States, the new information suggests a wide rift between top and bottom. Tax data from the WTID suggest that today the top 1% control nearly 20% of U.S. income, up from about 8% in the 1970s. But inequality is increasing within the 99% too, as a consequence of a growing premium on college and postgraduate education: The fates of the tech-savvy worker at Google and the blue-collar employee at General Motors have been decoupled (see Autor, p. [843][9]) According to surveys by the Census Bureau, in 2012 the richest 20% of Americans enjoyed more than 50% of the nation's total income, up from 43% in 1967. The middle 20%the actual middle classreceived only about 14% of all income, and the poorest got a mere 3% (see p. [820][10]) Flip to a world map, and America's inequality, despite reaching levels last seen in the Gilded Age, turns out to be far from extreme. Many nations, especially emerging economies, have even larger chasms between the super-rich and the poor. One widely used metric, the Gini coefficient, estimates inequality as an index between 0at which point everyone has exactly equal incomesto 1, in which a single person takes all the income and the rest get nothing. The U.S. Gini, at 0.40 in 2010, seems relatively high compared with, for example, Japan at 0.32. But South Africa is a sky-high 0.7. Many assume that governments in emerging economies have chosen to favor growth even at the cost of inequality on the grounds that a rising tide lifts all boats. But evidence that this trade-off is necessary is sparse, and recent data show that policies to reduce inequality need not stymie growth (see Ravallion, p. [851][11]) What of those at the bottom? Research has established a base of knowledge about the harmful effects of disadvantageous circumstances on education and health. These influences can begin early in life, even prenatally (see Aizer and Currie, p. [856][12]) But researchers are still exploring whether the stress of being low-ranked itself adds to the poor's burden, causing illness and even early death (see p. [829][13]) In addition, psychological mechanisms may spur a negative feedback loop in which poor individuals behave in ways that help keep them poor (see Haushofer and Fehr, p. [862][14]) Harsh as life can be for those at the bottom, the opportunity to move up the ladder can compensate. Newly available data from taxes and other records promise to yield insights into intergenerational mobility, in which children advance from their parents' socioeconomic status. But so far, researchers have a relatively limited view of how and why people move into different social, as well as economic, classes (see p. [836][15] and ; also see Corak, p. [812][16]) Few would deny that excessive inequality can be unhealthy for societies and economies, but the new data don't pinpoint a desirable level. They do show that the forces that foster inequalityfrom the patchy distribution of resources among ancient hunter-gatherers to the sheer earning power of capital todayare many and potent.

While there continues to be widespread concern about inequality of incomes, this is declining and focused mostly on higher earners there appears to be less public concern about any injustice in terms of the numbers on lower incomes. Recent research on social mobility has been influential and may be one means of focusing attention on the effects of a widening income distribution. Even so, such research could do more to highlight the differences in outcomes based on personal characteristics (eg disability and minority ethnic background) as well as parental characteristics.

Significant polarization arises from minor differences in endowments, preferences or access to capital markets. This makes income inequality more persistent across generations, but the same need not be true for wealth. Equilibrium stratification tends to be excessive, resulting in low aggregate surplus. Whether state equalization of school resources can remedy these problems hinges on how purchased, social and family inputs interact in education and in mobility decisions.",

Agents have identical preferences and access to identical technologies of production and investment, but differing levels of initial human capital. A spillover effect of human capital in the investment technology provides below-average human capital agents with a higher rate of return on investment than above-average human capital agents. Thus below-average human capital agents grow faster than above-average human capital agents.

    "300": "International research on the effects of educational regimes on intergenerational mobility suggests that Singapore's education system possesses characteristics that tend to decrease intergenerational mobility. These characteristics include ability-based and school-based streaming, privatization of basic and tertiary education, expansion of tertiary education while increasing fees, and possibly regressive public expenditure on education. These characteristics are motivated by a belief in offering multiple pathways for success, and thereby developing a globally competitive workforce. However, comparisons between Singapore and Finland suggest that greater equity and mobility can be achieved without necessarily compromising students' performance and the nation's economic competitiveness. Given wide income disparity and at best moderate intergenerational mobility in Singapore, evaluations of the mobility effects of the various characteristics of Singapore's education system should be conducted. Priority should be given to rethinking Singapore's educational model. Remedial interventions such as bursaries and peripheral interventions such as the regulation of early education or private tuition have limited effectiveness if the main system reinforces immobility. The lessons in this study for Singapore can also be extended to other countries with differentiated education systems.",

This paper proposes an informal institutional mechanismthe community-based networkthrough which families belonging to the same neighbourhood or kinship group can bootstrap their way out of such low-skill occupational traps. The insight from the dynamic model that is developed is that once they form, new networks providing mutual support to their members and substituting for inherited parental human capital and wealth will strengthen most rapidly in historically disadvantaged communities, generating a correspondingly high level of intergenerational mobility. These predictions are successfully tested using unique data from India. The analysis in this paper, coupled with an emerging empirical literature on networks and migration, provides a new perspective on mobility in developing countries, with restrictive traditional networks decaying even as new networks supporting collective mobility form and strengthen over time.",

During the 1960s and 1970s when Hong Kong's economy was booming rapidly, career advancement opportunities were abundant even for the less educated migrants and their children. But when the economic restructuring occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, trades such as manufacturing and construction sectors, where a large number of workers with migration background were employed, were hit most hardly. The problem of the intergenerational transmission of poverty and low social mobility has now become the focus in the agenda of poverty alleviation. This article aims to use a subsample of the 2006 By-Census dataset to explore whether children with migration background from Mainland China were generally disadvantaged in their educational attainment and income. The findings confirmed this hypothesis, indicating that the human capital investment strategy in Hong Kong is not sufficient to break down the barriers for children in disadvantaged social positions.",
    "307": "We argue that stability and increasing fluidity coexist in the contemporary Japanese social stratification system. It is often argued that the weakening of Japanese employment practices has made the labor market more flexible. While there is evidence to support this argument, it misses an important factor in the labor market, namely social stratification. We suggest that some parts of the labor market have become more fluid, while other parts have been stable. To test this prediction, we examine empirical findings made in the 2005 Social Stratification and Social Mobility Survey Project, covering such topics as education and inequality, increasing fluidity and disparity among young workers, job changes, and income inequality. Our findings on education and inequality show that stratification in the educational system affects the entry of graduates into regular or non-regular employment. Our analysis of young workers shows that while the longterm employment practice persists in large firms and the public sector and thus shows stability, mobility between regular and non-regular employment is difficult and that young female graduates from high schools and junior colleges recently find it difficult to enter the regular employment sector. Our analysis of the effect of education on job changes shows that the income of less educated workers who change jobs has decreased recently. We also find increasing income inequality between professionals and other occupations and examine the intergenerational transmission of income. We conclude that these findings generally support our prediction that stability and increasing fluidity coexist in the contemporary Japanese labor market. We consider the implications of this for the study of social stratification in Japan.",

Furthermore, excessive intragenerational inequality may inhibit, rather than encourage, economic growth.

This paper, therefore, proposes a theory of intergenerational mobility whereby instilling strict work attitudes is an instrument to address moral hazard in poor families more so than in rich families, which is consistent with empirical regularities pertaining to work attitudes. The mechanism implies that hardworking children of the poor converge to and may eventually overtake leisureprone children of the rich.",
    "316": "Familial-based economies dominated by elders and males benefit from high fertility as large families provide labor and security against old age and hence economic advantage for those in positions of power and authority. The familial power structure serves the purpose of preserving stable relations of production and continuity in a materially advantageous status quo. In such economies the net intergenerational wealth flow is upward with women and the young consuming less and contributing more labor than men and elders. In the West where parents spend more on children and depend less on them the net intergenerational flow of wealth is a downward one. After industrialization in the West the precapitalist familial mode of production continued to oeprate inside households. A 2-tiered system of production thus prevailed until changes in the market economy gradually eroded the familial hosuehold mode of production thus leading to social change and making it uneconomic to have large families. Developing countries will no doubt pass through the same stage of a 2-tiered mode of production but the transition to a capitalist mode of production will be shorter due to the availability of contraceptives and the impact of education and the Western example emphasizing sex and age equality.",

This paper shows that the income-education association varies greatly across groups of children with different versions of a specific gene, monoamine-oxidase A (MAOA) which impacts neurotransmitter activity. For children with one MAOA variant, increases in household income have the expected positive association with education. For children with another variant, who comprise over half of the population, this relationship is much weaker. These results hold when the interactive effects are identified using genetic variation between full biological siblings, which genetic principles assert is as good as randomly assigned.",

After documenting important differences in early child investments by family income, we study four leading mechanisms thought to explain these gaps: intergenerational ability correlation, consumption value of investment, information frictions, and credit constraints. We evaluate whether these mechanisms are consistent with other stylized facts related to the marginal returns on investments and the effects of parental income on child investments and skills.",

We examine the link between income and net fertility using data from wills on reproductive success, social status and income for England 15851638. We find that for this society, close to a Malthusian equilibrium, wealth robustly predicted reproductive success. The richest testators left twice as many children as the poorest. Consequently, in this static economy, social mobility was predominantly downwards. The result extends back to at least 1250 in England.",

Households are assumed to be heterogeneous in their labor market productivity. With homogeneous preferences and monotone-increasing marginal tax rates, we prove that agents who are not borrowing-constrained must have the lowest income in the population. Corollaries of this fact are that capital and labor income must be negatively correlated, which then implies that so must income and wealth. We then show how to construct models with preference heterogeneity that match the data on income, assets, and hours worked. Using this model we estimate the consequences of changing the progressivity of the tax code; we find that the model can produce mobility in wealth but not in income.",

Low caste boys have significantly higher learning outcomes when taught by high caste teachers.

However, social class mobility in Latin America does not differ from that in the industrialized world. This essay reviews two generations of mobility research since the 1960s, takes stock of current findings on economic and class mobility in Latin America, examines the linkages between mobility and macro-level factors, and engages a new literature on equality of opportunity.

    "368": "Intergenerational mobility in income and education is affected by the influence of parents on childrens school choices. Our focus is on the role played by different school systems in reducing or magnifying the impact of parents on childrens school choices and therefore on intergenerational mobility in general. We compare two apparently similar educational systems, Italy and Germany, to see how the common feature of the presence of separate track at Secondary School level may produce different impacts on children destinies. Using data from cross-country surveys (PISA 2003) we study the impact of parental education on track choice, showing that the greater flexibility of the Italian system (where parents are free to choose the type of track) translates into greater dependence from parental background. These effects are reinforced when moving to post-secondary education, where the aspiration to go to college is affected not only by the school type but also (in the case of Italy only) by parental education. We then move to country-specific data sets to study actual college choices in nationally representative sample, and we find that parental education still play an independent role on student choices.",

    "376": "Traditionally, the transition from school to work has been important for young adults, and turning 21 was recognised as the marker of adulthood in Australia, when young people had jobsand even families of their own. Social and economic changes over the past 30 years or so have made the transition from school to work more complex and less clear-cut. This report documents the factors that shape the lives of 123 young participants in the Life Chances Study, as they turn 21. Key points Stereotypes about young people obscure the diverse and complex lives of 21-year-olds. This diversity is shaped by family income, gender, ethnic background and resources. The 21-year-olds included university and TAFE students, full-time and part-time workers, young parents and jobseekers. Many were both studying and working. Those with fewer resources were more likely to identify as adults. They faced challenges that those with more resources could avoid. While some welcomed adulthood, others felt the burden of responsibilities. 21-year-olds continued to rely on their families for advice, and emotional and financial support. The unequal access to resources reinforced inequalities because even though most had jobs, many still relied on their parents financial supportif they could. Disadvantage need not be intergenerational. Disadvantage or advantage persisted for some families, but not for all. Childhood in a low-income family did not necessarily condemn children to continuing disadvantage. Definitions of a successful transition must take into account young peoples multiple activities and their wellbeing. Most 21-year-olds aspired to full-time employment. In this study, most of those who did not have a job and were not studying or in training had caring duties or mental health issues. Labelling these young people as disengaged does not sufficiently capture their level of activity or wellbeing. Transitions for 21-year-olds are uncertain, but the social and economic resources needed to address this uncertainty are not evenly distributed. Those from high-income backgrounds with strong social supports had greater choice while negotiating their pathways than those from lower income backgrounds. Policies need to address multidimensional disadvantage. The findings have implications for addressing socioeconomic inequalities as well as for targeted career and vocational guidance. Background The Life Chances Study is a unique longitudinal study initiated by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in 1990 to explore the impacts of family income and associated factors on children over time. It commenced as a study of 167 infants born in inner Melbourne and has followed the families as they have moved elsewhere. In stage 10 of the study we surveyed 123 young people and their parents to see how they were dealing with the important transitions towards adulthood. We also undertook 25 interviews to explore their situations in more depth.",

We focus on the one percent of wealth owners and identify patterns in asset ownership, liabilities, and demographic traits that are relevant to sociological research. Findings show, for example, that those in the one percent have unique asset and debt portfolios that, to some extent, insulated them from the ill effects of the recent recession; however, patterns reported also highlight inheritance and suggest that mobility into the one percent is possible.

    "380": "A basic theme in the theory of international trade has been to study welfare gains and income redistribution caused by trade liberalization. Using optimizing finite lives overlapping generations combined with long-term real assets and adjustment costs in accumulating capital, this paper establishes new current account and welfare redistribution results caused by financial liberalization. After briefly describing the model for the closed economy case, we study the resulting evolution of the current account, the accumulation of capital, the real wage behavior and the adjustment of asset prices, when capital flows are allowed. Under the mentioned framework, we are able to show that an unanticipated liberalization of the capital account can cause an overshooting or an undershooting in external debt behavior during the transition. Another consequence associated with the liberalization policy, is the creation of some transitional welfare losers, eventhough the welfare of steady state generations is improved. By following appropriate compensatory policies, we can show that the country may achieve a Pareto welfare improvement for current alld future generations. As a wav of reducing the intergenerational redistributions induced bv the opening of the capital account, we discuss the alternative of adopting more gradual strategies of liberalization.",
    "387": "The emergence of persistent political hierarchy and economic inequality beginning about eleven thousand years ago may be explained in part by the novel equilibrium network structures that post-Pleistocene ecological and economic conditions supported. I explore how changes in the nature of wealth and the division of labor could have induced transitions among three stable network structures: symmetric networks with little political hierarchy or economic inequality, asymmetrical networks with political hierarchy but little economic inequality and asymmetrical networks with both hierarchy and inequality. As in Kets, Iyengar, the distribution of benefits on these networks is limited by the feasible coalitions that may withdraw from the existing network, where membership in a coalition is restricted to those who are within distance k in the network. A distribution of benefits on a network is stable if no feasible coalition can benefit by deviating from the network. In addition to k, the key determinant in the mapping from economic conditions to the above three equilibrium networks is the extent of intermediation decay in network benefits and the degree of intergenerational transmission of a population's important forms of wealth. Ethnographic and archaeological data from forager, horticultural and herding populations illustrate the model.",

The argument developed in this critical note proposes both a historical reading of the ideology of intergenerational equity, which is only conceivable in the transition from the Trente Glorieuses to the Trente Piteuses, and a structural reading arguing that, for the wealthy classes during the European Old Regime, successful transfers of wealth between generations followed the same formal requirements as those in the twenty-first century.",
    "402": "Janet Yellen [2014] Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank, opened the 2014 Conference of Economic Opportunity and Inequality with observations that provide an essential underpinning for Putnam's important new book:The past several decades have seen the most sustained rise in inequality since the 19th century after more than 40 years of narrowing inequality following the Great Depression. By some estimates, income and wealth inequality are near their highest level in 100 years The past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority. I think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation's history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity. (pp. 1-2) Although Putnam acknowledges Yellen's description of current economic inequality, he is more interested in her question about its implications for our national emphasis on equality of opportunity. As a nation, we are less concerned with whether everyone gets to a similar place in the economic ladder than with whether everyone has the same chance to climb that ladder. Putnam's [2015] book attempts to address this belief by answering one basic question: ''Do youth today coming from different social and economic backgrounds in fact have roughly equal life chances, and has that changed in recent decades?'' ( emphasis in the original).Putnam's answer begins with a return to his home town, Port Clinton, Ohio, to compare the fates of several of his fellow class-of-'59 high school graduates with two more recent graduates. The differences are revealing. Several of his classmates, including two African American students, grew up in working-class families with high school (or less) educated parents. Yet, with the help from sport coaches, a wealthy employer, and other community figures, many of Putnam's classmates were able to graduate from college. By contrast, two more recent Port Clinton high school graduates followed paths that diverged almost at birth. The child of a more affluent local family became student council president, an honor society recipient, and attended a Big 10 university with the expectation of going to law school. In contrast, the other graduate grew up poor, had a father in prison, fathered a daughter by a former drug-addicted girlfriend, and, at the age of 21, saw no hope for the future. Putnam argues that these extreme stories capture fundamental changes that swept through his hometown and much of America in the past 50 years, changes that have profoundly divided the life opportunities of American children depending on their parents' educational status and social class. In Putnam's home county, for example, high-paying manufacturing jobs fell from 55 to 25% of all jobs in 30 years. Today, the average worker there makes 16% less than his or her grandparents (adjusted for inflation) and has ''not had a real raise for nearly a half century'' () Although the social consequences of these changes lagged the economic collapse somewhat, by 2010 unwed births, for example, doubled to nearly 40% and in less than 15 years (1999-2013) the child poverty rate jumped from 10 to 40% A key point of Putnam's book, however, is that the impact of these changes depended on when and exactly where in Port Clinton you grew up. In 1990, both Port Clinton and neighboring Catawba Island had child poverty rates under 5% By 2010, however, Port Clinton's child poverty rate increased to more than 40% and, for the more desirable lakeside Catawba Island, it was still below 5% (for two adjoining census tracts it was 51 and 1%) In little more than 20 years, residential segregation and other changes associated with class and education had radically transformed Putnam's home county and the face of much of America.How could changes of this magnitude happen in such a short time? And what do they mean for daily lives and futures of children on different sides of the growing American class divide? After setting the stage for these questions in his first chapter, ''The American Dream: Myths and Realities,'' Putnam provides some partial answers in four chapters titled ''Families,'' ''Parenting,'' ''Schooling,'' and ''Community.''The chapter on ''Schooling'' provides a compelling comparison of the high school experiences of children from two different Latino families, with one family living in a school district having a per capita income four times higher than the other family's district. Although mean spending per student and student-teacher ratios are comparable in both schools (but see below) adolescents in the poorer district were more likely to be truant (daily rates of 33 vs. 2%) to drop out (27 vs. 7%) and scored markedly lower on statewide tests (bottom 20 vs. top 10%) than their richer peers. As would be expected, the daily experiences of children from these two families mirrored these differences. Isabella (from the wealthier district) says, ''the only bad thing is you have to be in the top 10-12 percent. Getting Bs was considered failing'' () In contrast, when Lola is asked about the academics in her school, she simply replies, ''There wasn't any'' () Later in that chapter, parents - especially upper middle-class parents - are described as being quite aware of these sorts of differences. One cited study [] for example, found that houses near a public school with high standardized test scores sold for USD 200,000 more than comparable homes near low-scoring schools. Putnam concludes the chapter with research linking this housing cost differential to the same pattern of residential segregation that affected his home town of Port Clinton over the past 30 years.The seven figures included in the ''Schooling'' chapter, on their own, provide a schematic but especially revealing summary of current class disparities in educational opportunities. For example, compared to their higher income peers, low-income students nationally attend schools that offer 1/3 as many Advanced Placement classes, 1/2 as many sports teams, and, partly as a result, are 2/3 as likely to engage in school-based extracurricular activities. Not surprisingly, low-income students are then half as likely to attend college and 1/5 as likely to graduate from college by the age of 30 as their higher-income peers. As reported by Putnam [2015]:Even more shocking, high-scoring [based on standardized academic tests] poor kids are now slightly less likely (29 percent) to get a college degree than low-scoring rich kids (30 percent) This last fact is particularly hard to square with the idea at the heart of the American Dream: equality of opportunity. ()By the end of the ''Schooling'' chapter, it is obvious that Putnam believes economic and other societal inequalities over the past 30 plus years have profoundly altered poorer children's opportunities to achieve the American Dream. Continued economic inequality, whatever some Americans may believe, has changed the communities and the neighborhood schools children attend in ways that seem likely to permanently alter their life trajectories. But how did things get this way? Without some working answer to this question, it is difficult to know how to narrow the diverging trajectories of children from more and less affluent families. In chapters titled ''Parenting'' and ''Families,'' Putnam outlines some answers that hint at a major cultural debate in the United States. On one side are critics who argue that changing social and moral values have weakened parental investments in their children, and, on the other, are those who stress the role of recent structural and economic changes in diminishing equality of opportunity. For example, in his recent book The Road to Character, Brooks [2015] cites a continuing Gallup Poll that asks high school seniors whether they consider themselves ''to be a very important person.'' In 1950, 12% said yes, and by 2005, 80% said yes. The problem for children and the parents who raise them, Brooks suggests, is that cultural values in the past half century have shifted from humility, self-restraint and public mindedness to an obsession with fame, individuality, and self-expression. In contrast, economists like Krugman [2012] and Stiglitz [2015] focus on changes like the 2008 recession that bankrupted millions of Americans ''while in the first years of the recovery, some 95% of the increases in income went to the top 1%'' () This tension - character versus opportunity structure - is also implied in Putnam's chapter ''Families.'' In 1975, fewer than 20% of children were born to single mothers in the US, and this varied only somewhat by maternal educational level. By 2007, however, nonmarital births jumped to 65% for mothers with a high school education or less and about 10% for college-educated women. Moreover, 5 years after these nonmarital births, more than 2/3 of all women were no longer romantically involved with their children's fathers. And even when mothers did marry, high-school-educated mothers were twice as likely to get divorced as college-educated women (28 vs. 14%) Collectively, the magnitude of these changes has profoundly altered family structures and the developmental pathways of American children. Put simply, ''children who grow up without their biological father perform worse on standardized tests, earn lower grades, and stay in school for fewer years'' [ ] Explaining the origin of these changes is a complex and potentially contentious task, and Putnam's account attempts to straddle America's ''culture wars.'' Marriage 50s style, he says, involved: (1) a ''strongly patriarchal division of labor'' supported by a level of economic prosperity that allowed most families to live on a single, male income, and (2) a clear norm against ''out-of-wedlock births.'' The subsequent changes to marriage and family, he continues, happened for a variety of reasons, including the advent of the birth control pill, the reduction of economic opportunities for working-class males, an emerging individualist focus on self-fulfillment, and the increasing economic need and cultural support for women to enter the work place. As a result of these changes, Putnam continues, America has somehow fractured into three clearly defined and relatively equally sized class groups: those with at least a college degree, those with some college or vocational training, and those with a high school degree or less. As the three groups have lived through increasing residential, educational, and cultural segregation over the past 50 years, they have also become increasingly different in their parenting practices, family dynamics, and child outcomes. Moreover, as the bulk of Putnam's book makes clear, children from poorer families are doing worse than their wealthier peers by almost any standard that can be assessed. Putnam's description of the cultural and economic changes that led to increasing class/education-based divergences in marital and family patterns, however, are not very convincing. To be fair, this is not the primary focus of his book, and definitive explanations for these changes are still being debated. Still, it is not clear how recent historical changes, including better birth control, a more individualistic focus on self-fulfillment, and changes in women's roles, could drive the increasing divergence in children's opportunity structures as a function of parental education/class. For example, the cultural shifts that Brooks [2015] has recently described - purported declines in humility, self-restraint, and public mindedness - are by his description broad trends affecting most Americans and Western Europeans. Moreover, these are trends that do not differ in any obvious way by class and/or education. Why then are the economic and educational consequences of these supposedly shifting moral emphases so different for richer and poorer US children? Putnam has an answer, which unfortunately is never really developed in the book:Unemployment, underemployment, and poor economic prospects discourage and undermine stable relationships - that is the nearly universal finding of many studies, both qualitative and quantitative. A growing portion of women in the lower portion of the economic hierarchy are reluctant to marry men who can offer little or no economic security. ()This last quote is especially revealing in light of Nicholas Lemann's [2015] recent review of Putnam's book. After summarizing the clear descriptive strengths of Our Kids, Lemann argues that Putnam's overwhelming emphases on relative mobility and social capital as correctives for current inequalities are fundamentally wrongheaded. Lemann's critique begins with historical research [e.g. ] indicating that American mobility is mostly ''structural'' in nature. In other words, Americans have typically moved up or down economically in very large groups (absolute mobility) rather than by changing their individual positions within the economic ladder (relative mobility) Moreover, Putnam even acknowledges this pattern, ''Over the grand sweep of history, relative mobility accounts for only a small portion of total mobility experienced by generations, whereas absolute (structural) mobility accounts for most of it'' () What is puzzling, then, is how Putnam could be aware of these continued economic realities and yet devote the overwhelming bulk of his book to relative rather than absolute mobility. As Lemann [2015] puts it,If Putnam were more focused on absolute mobility, which was the real engine of the American Dream for his generation, then he might have spent more time exploring economic policy generally or ways of recreating the widely distributed economic growth that so much helped Americans his age. (pp. 26-27)It could be argued that there are already a number of excellent books on problems involving absolute mobility [e.g. ; ; ] and that Putnam is more interested in how these problems have affected American children and their prospects for the future. At this level, Our Kids provides a powerful and extremely troubling picture of the accelerating divergences between children from different social-class backgrounds. Putnam's division of American families into three roughly equally sized groups (college-educated, some college/vocational training, and high school or less) is clearly related to the increasing segregation of children's life trajectories at birth. But this is only one part of Putnam's book. It is when he turns to his second main interest - how to stop and reverse these patterns - that the weaknesses of the book become especially salient.The recent changes in ''social capital'' that Putnam refers to throughout his book - the activities and associations, and formal and informal social bonds that form the textures of daily life - are real and troubling. It is not just as Putnam [2000] argued in a previous book that more of us are ''bowling alone,'' but, as he describes in Our Kids, the time, money, and emotional energy for ''bowling'' are increasingly dependent on our class/educational backgrounds. Lemann's [2015] criticism, which I share, is that Putnam alternates in his causal explanations of the links between social capital and economic mobility. As noted above, in several sections of his book Putnam persuasively argues that: (a) massive economic changes have preceded disruptions in our social fabric and (b) changes in absolute rather than relative mobility are responsible for most of this disruption. Yet much of the book suggests that if we could only improve our social capital, the necessary social and economic changes would follow. In Lemann's [2015] words, Putnam ''is most intensely focused on increasing opportunity for individuals by increasing their locally available store of social capital - through improved ways of rearing children, and encouraging activities and associations that will increase their chance in life'' () This last criticism of Our Kids - that it often misunderstands the likely causal links between social capital, economic changes, and children's life opportunities - has its own potential difficulties. As Putnam argues, increasing poorer children's access to extracurricular activities, school and nonschool mentors, and high-quality community resources (e.g. parks, libraries, youth organizations) are important social goods on their own; goods that do not depend on their role in producing structural economic changes. Schools and schooling, however, play a more complex role in debates about possible causal links between structural economic changes and children's life opportunities, especially as educational status and social class have become more tightly connected. Many Americans put their hopes in the transformative power of educational institutions and innovations for addressing economic and societal inequalities. Yet, as Putnam [2015] Duncan and Murnane [2011] and numerous other researchers have described [see also for a brief review] children's educational opportunities in the United States depend on the specific schools they attend, and the quality of these schools is increasingly affected by ongoing patterns of economic and residential segregation. The good news is that researchers and educators are developing an increasingly fine-tuned understanding of how to improve the educational experiences and performance of children and adolescents from poorer communities [see, e.g. ] The bad news is that it is unclear whether Americans have the political will to make the necessary educational changes or whether those changes, on their own, can halt or slow the growth of inequalities in our children's life opportunities. Putnam [2015] began his book by saying he saw his hometown change from a passable embodiment of the American dream [to] a community in which kids from the wrong side of the tracks that bisect town can barely imagine the future that awaits the kids from the right side of the tracks. And the story of Port Clinton turns out sadly to be typical of America. How this transformation happened, why it matters, and how we might begin to alter the cursed state of our society is subject of this book. ()By its conclusion, Our Kids has provided vivid and disturbing answers to the first two questions while also beginning to address policy debates about how to alter our ''cursed state.'' It is a book that will appeal to everyone concerned with increasing inequality and its accelerating impact on American children's diverging life trajectories.",
    "404": "Supported by a virtual plethora of impact evaluations, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) have been widely promoted for their ability to simultaneously pursue short-term poverty alleviation through income support and long-term poverty reduction through human capital investments. In particular, their claim to fame lies in their perceived capacity to enable a break in intergenerational transmission of poverty. This study presents an inquiry into such capacities. First, it filters that which is known from that which remains assumed through a synthesis of systematic reviews. The inquiry corroborates existing research and finds that evidence concerning CCTs impact pertains almost exclusively to short-term effects from a handful of localized cases, providing scarce information on the programs alleged long-term capabilities. That is, existing evidence lacks any demonstrated effects on long-term poverty reduction and human capital enhancement the two overriding goals of the programs. More importantly, it contributes to existing research and problematizes CCTs promoted long-term impact by further qualifying the known and by analyzing the empirical foundations of the programs implicit assumptions. Findings of largely untested theoretical assumptions pertaining to the human capital social mobility nexus further challenge the basis for CCTs promoted capacity to enable a break in intergenerational transmission of poverty. These findings are deemed particularly relevant to developing countries in Africa and Asia and their efforts to adequately incorporate CCTs into poverty reduction strategies and policies. (Less)",

The mechanisms of sustaining inequalities by elites are many, including producing generational disabilities in underclasses to prevent upward mobility and the development of achieved statuses.",
    "409": "Intergenerational earnings mobility is analyzed in a model where human capital is produced using schooling and parental time. In steady states more mobile societies have less inequality, but in the short run higher mobility may result from an increase in inequality. Starting from the same inequality, mobility is higher under public than under private education. A rise in income shocks, for example due to increased returns to ability, or a switch from public to private schooling both increase inequality. However, increased shocks raise mobility in the short run and do not affect it in the long run, whereas an increased role for private schooling reduces mobility in both the short and long run. That these differences may help to identify the source of changes in inequality, and other realworld implications, are illustrated in a brief discussion of time trends and crosscountry differences.",

We provide some comparative statics results considering different levels of intergenerational mobility. After, we allow interaction among families in credit markets within the same income class and within all families in the economy. A trivial welfare analysis shows that when frictionless markets are available, a Pareto superior outcome is feasible. Then we introduce a benevolent government that taxes families purely on redistributive purposes and compare the policy implied outcome with one associated to available credit markets. In our model framework the government cannot replicate competitive allocation.",
    "411": "We examine how intergenerational income mobility responds to structural changes in a simple theoretical model of intergenerational transmission, deviating from the existing literature by explicitly analyzing the transition path between steady states. We find that mobility depends not only on current but also on past transmission mechanisms, such that changing policies, institutions or economic conditions may generate long-lasting trends. Variation in mobility levels across countries may thus be partly explained by differences in former institutions; current mobility trends may be caused by institutional changes in the past.We further find that transitions between steady states tend to be non-monotonic. Changes in the relative returns to different skills or a shift towards a less plutocratic and more meritocratic economy raise mobility initially, but also generate a negative trend over subsequent generations. Times of change thus tend to be times of high mobility, and declining mobility today may not reflect a recent deterioration of equality of opportunity but rather major improvements made in the past.",

We also propose a refinement to the asymptotic approximation that we show works much better in finite samples. We apply our test to the study of intergenerational income mobility.",

We propose an endogenous growth model with occupational choice and an endogenous supply of teachers and education quality. We show that endogenous school quality alters the shape of those relationships in a way that has new policy implications. First, growth depends on the level of public education expenditures and on the shape of the human capital distribution. Second, the relationship between public education and inequality can be either positive or negative. Calibrating our model to US state data, we find that a significant share of states faces a trade-off between increasing growth and decreasing inequality through public education spending. We find that this trade-off is overall more likely in states with higher public education expenditures, teacher employment share and relative wage, and intergenerational mobility. Finally, the existence of such a trade-off depends on how public education spending is financed.",

On the basis of data gathered in an extensive study of the rich of four large northeastern cities in the antebellum period, Pessen concludes that the egalitarian hypothesis is not sustained. Wealth was unequally distributed and economic mobility was very limited, in the sense that the rich had rich forbears. Although the origins of great fortunes lay with entrepreneurial types, their descendents gradually withdrew from active business life, maintaining general oversight of wealth that grew almost automatically as the result of fortunate early investments, profitable marriages, and the advantages of membership in a small elite.",
    "435": "We study a model of wealth accumulation in altruistic lineages, in which households face uninsurable risk, investment indivisibilities and borrowing constraints. A thick upper tail of the stationary distribution of wealth is shown to emerge as a robust prediction, irrespective of (1) the presence of multidimensional (wealth and ability) heterogeneity and non-convexities in human capital formation, and (2) the nature of parental bequest motives (joy-of-giving vs. paternalism) Additionally, (3) we identify conditions under which the unique, ergodic wealth distribution exhibits a mass point at the bottom of its support, where credit market imperfections continue to affect, along the convergence process, the structure of wealth transitions at the lineage level. Motivated by these results, we then analyze the sensitivity of the left tail to various frictions and fiscal instruments that affect bequest strategies and the ensuing transmission of wealth across generations. In particular, capital income or bequest taxes with no redistribution may reinforce economic mechanisms underpinning mobility traps in the left tail, thereby increasing the persistence of households in the lowest tiers of the wealth distribution.",

The long-held faith in the growth of income as the sole policy instrument to achieve the national objective of growth with equity has been put to the test. The increasing numbers of the poor, accompanied by the widening gap between the upper- and lower-income strata, have prompted researchers to explore the reasons for these shifts so that policies to address the problem can be formulated and implemented. Recent experience shows that micro-level intervention policies that empower individuals have been successful in achieving better results on this count. One such policy intervention is educational expansion, in terms of both quantity and quality. Education is considered to be a significant factor in building better human skills and hence largely affects the earning ability of an individual. This article explores the role of education as an intervening instrument for bringing about a socio-economic transformation. On the basis of primary data collected from the state of Odisha (in India) an attempt has been made to examine the possibility of achieving better income distribution and increased intergenerational movements through educational expansion and changes in educational policy.",

The lesson of Gregory Clark's fascinating book is that it was all pointless. Social mobility is no greater in the West today than it was in medieval England. Upward mobility in Sweden today is no better than in the eighteenth century. Nor is it better in contemporary Sweden than in the United States. The wealth of East Asia exploded in the past half-century. Modernity came to Asia aggressively. But this had relatively little impact on who climbed up or slid down the social ladder.

This could inhibit social mobility, exacerbate the intergenerational transmission of wealth and deepen housing inequality. Although research shows that parental socio-economic advantage is associated with filial homeownership, less is known about whether these relationships are particularly pronounced in expensive housing markets where access to homeownership is often more constrained. This study tests this hypothesis by enriching the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study of England and Wales with data on local transactional house prices. Multilevel models indicate that disparities in the odds of homeownership between young adults with more and less socio-economically advantaged parents tend to deepen with increasing house prices. This pattern is most noticeable for women. However, parents and prices only intersect to greatly stratify the probability of homeownership when young adults circumstances are otherwise conducive to owning.",

Masson thereby elaborates a gentle critique of the moral principles often lying beneath the analyses of liberal economists (such as the demonstration effect, disen-franchisement, or the theory of homo reciprocans ) Accepting the ambitions of economic science, Masson nonetheless maintains a conception of the social sciences that is more competitive than cooperative and provides convincing analysis of the economic and social foundations of current intergenerational transfers. The argument developed in this critical note proposes both a historical reading of the ideology of intergenerational equity, which is only conceivable in the transition from the Trente Glorieuses to the Trente Piteuses and a structural reading arguing that, for the wealthy classes during the European Old Regime, successful transfers of wealth between generations followed the same formal requirements as those in the twenty-first century.",
    "489": "Intergenerational mobility is relatively low in the United States. Children who grow up in poverty are eight times more likely to live in poverty in adulthood than their counterparts who do not live in poverty. What is it about growing up in poverty that reduces the probability of economic success later in life? On average, children whose families live in poverty have lower levels of cognitive skills, noncognitive skills (e.g. behavior including perseverance and adaptability) and health, all of which contribute to earnings in adulthood. In this article, I examine the role children's health plays in intergenerational transmission of economic status from an economic perspective and in the context of a developed, highincome country (the United States) Evidence suggests that the mechanisms by which parents income affects children's health include, but are not limited to, reduced access to health insurance and medical care, greater exposure to environmental toxins, inadequate nutrition, and greater family violence and stress. I conclude with evidence suggesting that public investments in children's health can reduce the intergenerational transmission of economic status and the inequality of the next generation in the United States, as well as in other less developed nations.",

This paper attempts to see if the classical liberal tradition can endorse inheritance taxation so as to further fair equality of opportunity, as well as to lessen inequality of undeserved wealth. It argues that fair equality of opportunity is a necessary feature of market societies to make sure that they remain competitive. Hence, inheritance taxation is most likely necessary from a classical liberal point of view as an instrument of social mobility to counter notable problems of social immobility, say hereditary vocational stratification, which a system of private property rights creates.",

Improvement has not occurred for the tribals who are spatially isolated and hence outside the orbit of mainstream economic dynamics calling for more inclusive policies.",

Micropolitan areas help to define the blurred boundaries of the new rural-urban interface, and play a unique and potentially powerful role in supporting the upward mobility of low-income youth. In some geographic areas, micropolitan counties serve as cores of nonmetropolitan America, supporting upward mobility in ways that take advantage of their density and scale. In other domains, they are relatively low-density transition zones between remote noncore rural counties and metropolitan America, supporting upward mobility of low-income youth in ways that exploit the opportunities and reveal weaknesses associated with nonmetropolitan small size, lack of density, and limited technological capacity.",

Questions arise as to how wealth is generated, held and perpetuated, and, following whether pre-existing wealth will grow more quickly than that generated out of the current economy. These questions have implications for the distribution of wealth (and income) and intergenerational mobility. To that end, this paper updates the analysis in of the 1996 New Zealand Rich List with analysis of the 2005 and 2015 Lists. We find that the wealth held by the richest 0.01% of the New Zealand population has risen from 6% of annual GDP in 1996 to more than 21% in 2015. There is some evidence that this wealth has persisted or will persist across multiple generations. However, there is also significant turnover in the make-up of the top 0.01% and most of the fortunes are generated in industries deemed competitive.",
    "508": "This paper estimates sibling correlations in cognitive and non-cognitive skills to evaluate the importance of family background for skill formation. Based on a large representative German dataset including IQ test scores and measures of non-cognitive skills, a restricted maximum likelihood model indicates a strong relationship between family background and skill formation. Sibling correlations in non-cognitive skills range from 0.22 to 0.46; therefore, at least one-fifth of the variance in these skills results from shared sibling-related factors. Sibling correlations in cognitive skills are higher than 0.50; therefore, more than half of the inequality in cognition can be explained by shared family background.Comparing these findings with those in the intergenerational skill transmission literature suggests that intergenerational correlations capture only part of the influence of family on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills, as confirmed by decomposition analyses and in line with previous findings on educational and income mobility.",
    "516": "The aim of these essays is to contribute both theoretically and empirically to a better understanding of the role of social status in intergenerational income mobility. Sociological theories have emphasized the role of social status in the generation of persistent ex-ante inequality between families, but it has received limited attention in economics. In order to advance in this direction, the first chapter proposes a theoretical model to analyze the role of reference groups and inequality in intergenerational mobility. Based on recent empirical findings, and the alternative assumptions of standard theory and prospect theory, we model the effect of reference group income on effort decisions. Findings suggest that reference group affects the inequality of economic success between identical individuals with different social origins. The size and direction of this effect depend on four key issues: (a) the composition of the reference group; (b) the functional form of relative concern; (c) ex-ante inequality and relative effort rewards; (d) expected effort beliefs and past mobility trajectories. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reference group effect leads to individuals making sub-optimal social welfare decisions. This first chapter considers only one perspective of status and focuses on the comparative role of the reference groups. However, previous literature suggests that relative concern can be addressed from different perspectives. The second chapter presents an extension of the model, which incorporates an additional perspective of social status: social rewards based on how others value the observable actions of individuals. This approach allows us to assess both the role of each status motive separately (reference group and social rewards) and their interaction. The model confirms the importance of social status to explain effort decisions and allows us to discuss under what circumstances both status motives could be an additional mechanism for the persistence of inequality between generations. We identify three different mechanisms of inequality persistence. Mobility could be low because the poor people are not sufficiently motivated to move up, due to the reference group composition. They are being discouraged by society as a whole because of low status rewards. Finally, they are discouraged by expected peer effort, because their peer group failed past attempts to move up. However, under certain circumstances, status motives could reduce economic inequalities. This is the case when reference groups of agents with a low social origin include agents from a high social origin or when the social rewards of economic success are high. The first two chapters show that the response in the effort decisions to changes in expected reference income depends on the concavity or convexity of the relative concern curve. While generally confirming the asymmetry of relative concern, previous empirical research on the levels of satisfaction considering the peers income as a reference point, is ambiguous with respect to its concavity or convexity. The third chapter contributes to the empirical economic literature with new evidence on how relative income with respect to the reference group can affect economic satisfaction, testing the assumptions of prospect theory. Furthermore, we analyze how some aspects of personality affect relative concern and economic satisfaction. Unlike previous findings, convexity is confirmed between people facing relative deprivation, which corresponds to diminishing marginal sensitivity as they move away from the reference income. Therefore, relative concern is more important among those who are close to the reference income level, and its sensitivity is greater for those in the area of relative deprivation. These results are consistent with the assumptions of prospect theory. Furthermore, we confirm that some personality characteristics affect the marginal satisfaction of income comparisons.",

The increase in black educational persistence is found in both two-parent and single-parent households, and I do not find similar trends and differences when estimating intergenerational income persistence.",
    "521": "The identity of the United States as a land of opportunity and a nation of immigrants is once again being contested. As of 2013, income inequality and the foreign-born share of the American population are at levels not seen since the end of the Age of Mass Migration (1850-1914) and intergenerational mobility is at a historical low. These changes have provoked calls for restrictive and selective immigration policies, which are better designed to attract immigrants equipped to make it in America. Underlying these calls, however, is an assumption that the outcomes of immigration depend on who migrates rather than what opportunities people encounter or create for themselves after arrival.This dissertation focuses on the difference that place and context make to the lives of people. Broadly, it asks: are intergenerational inequalities in income, education and location mainly driven by individual and family characteristics, or are they driven by peoples access to opportunity and their interaction with places? This dissertation uses cutting-edge techniques and newly available data sources from the Age of Mass Migration to tackle these questions. These data shed light on the problem of people and place by helping to address three crucial questions. First, how do places affect decisions to migrate? Second, is immigrant social mobility mainly driven by family characteristics or opportunities at settlement locations? Third, how do differences in the opportunity structures of places emerge? The following five chapters address these three questions. Chapter 1 provides the conceptual apparatus for understanding how the characteristics of place and people shape inequality in life chances. Chapters 2 and 3 examine these questions using newly assembled data on three generations of Irish American families from 1901 to 1940. Chapter 4 exploits records from the Industrial Removal Office, an organization which helped 40,000 struggling Jewish households leave New York in the early twentieth century, as a natural experiment to study the effect of place on immigrant assimilation. Finally, Chapter 5 studies how long-run development processes have shaped intergenerational mobility outcomes from the Age of Mass Migration to today.",
    "522": "In a pension system with uniform policies for contribution and accrual, each participant has the same contribution rate and accrual rate independent of the age at the time of payment. Although a common practice for public sector pension plans in many countries, this is not actuarially fair because the investment horizon of young participants is longer than the investment horizon of the elderly. We show the unintended redistributive intergenerational effects of a uniform contribution system and the consequences of switching from uniform policies to an actuarially fair system, first analytically in a stylized model with three overlapping generations. We then quantify these effects in a detailed model with multiple overlapping generations, realistic parameters and detailed information on the income distribution, calibrated on the Dutch funded pension system. The system implies a substantial transfer of income from poor to wealthy participants of about 10 billion euros. The gross aggregate transition effect of abolishing the uniform policy pension for an actuarially fair system is about 37 billion euros (5% of the Dutch GDP) For each cohort, the redistributive effects are less than 5% of their total pension.",
    "527": "Preferences for redistribution and social spending are correlated with income and unemployment risk, but it is unclear how these relationships come about. I build a theory emphasizing that only large changes in economic circumstances provide the information and motivation needed for people to change their preferences. Stable long-run preferences are shaped mainly by early socialization, which includes economic and ideological influences from the family, and early labor market experiences. Enduring shocks, low intergenerational mobility and the tendency of left-wing parents to be poorer generate correlations between circumstances and preferences. Because preferences are stable, greater inequality may not increase aggregate support for redistribution. Support is found for the theory with panel data from Switzerland, using a range of empirical tests.",

The set of social relations constitute a form of capital that provides the individual with a wide range of resources. Social capital interacts with other forms of capital, particularly with human capital, to enhance inequality. The overlapping-generations model proposed here focuses on the long-term investment processes in human and social capital. When these effects are considered, a society may end up divided into two groups. The first comprises people stuck in a trap of low intergenerational mobility resources. The second group includes people with increasing levels of education and social capital. Within the last group, income inequalities persist due to initial differences in social capital.",
    "531": "We build a model that, according to the empirical evidence, gives rise to oscillations in wealth within a dynasty while keeping intergenerational persistence in education attainment. We propose a mechanism based on the interaction between wealth and effort as suggested by the Carnegie conjecture, according to which wealthier individuals devote less effort in their job occupations than poorer. Oscillations in wealth arise from changes in the occupation chosen by different generations of the same dynasty as a response to both inherited wealth and college premium. Our mechanism generates a rich social stratification with several classes in the long run due to the combination of different levels of education and occupation types. Furthermore, we generate a large mobility in wealth among classes even in the long run. Our model highlights the role played by the minimum cost on education investment, the borrowing constraints, and the complementarity between education and occupational effort.",
    "538": "Though studies have clearly illustrated that education is one of the primary paths to upward mobility, a growing body of research is beginning to show that the returns on education are determined more by initial wealth than innate ability and exerted effort in school. This accounting directly contradicts Americans understanding of the promise of the American Dream: a level playing field and a path towards a more prosperous future. Currently, this contradiction goes largely unchecked by researchers because of their reluctance to engage in a discussion about values. As a result, the mere discussion of wealth transfer, a policy about thriving, is seen as taboo, and we are left with conversations about how to provide the poor with enough merely to survive. However, in this paper, the conversation about wealth transfer is revived and articulated as an American idea consistent with American values. It goes on to offer Childrens Savings Accounts, in combination with a substantial progressive wealth transfer into these accounts, as a means of leveling the playing field and restoring education as an equalizer in society.",

Additionally, although social theorists have long called for the demise of the petit bourgeoisie, or entrepreneur class, it, too, is on the rise. In this paper, we integrate practice theory with entrepreneurship research to develop a process theory of inequality. Instead of focusing on wealth and income disparities, we examine the role of routinized social behaviors, or practices, and we describe how groups within society capture valuable practices, which leads to inequality and social stratification. At the same time, entrepreneurs introduce new practices and reapply or recombine existing practices to facilitate mobility and disrupt social stratification.",

    "550": "We use a quasi-experimental design and Swedish administrative data to document that the average heir depletes her inheritance within a decade while the inheritances of wealthy heirs remain intact. These different depletion rates are not due to different consumption or labor supply responses but due to different rates of return on inherited wealth. Upon their receipt, inheritances reduce relative measures of wealth inequality, such as top shares or percentile ratios. Theoretically, this reduction in inequality could be due to either a compressed inheritance distribution or similar chances of having wealthy parents (high intergenerational mobility) Empirically, the first force is more significant in Sweden. Within a decade, however, the effect is reversed: inheritances increase wealth inequality since the different depletion rates widen the inequality in inherited wealth over time. This implies that inheritance taxation can reduce long-run wealth inequality only through the taxation of wealthy heirs.",

Savings and accumulation rates depend on the relative price of services consumed by old agents and on the intergenerational distribution of income. The feedback effects originating in preferences and income distribution yield three possible long-run growth outcomes: sustained endogenous growth, decumulation traps, and bounded accumulation. In the endogenous growth scenario, the transition features rising savings and accumulation rates accompanied by distributional shifts in favor of young workers, growing employment and rising prices in the service sector. Traps are triggered by initially low capital in manufacturing and low employment in services.

Yet, the United States Great Recession of 2008 had a devastating impact on the accumulated wealth of Latino entrepreneurs, widening a racial wealth gap that shows little signs of narrowing. This qualitative study investigates the significance of the recession on the wealth of and prospects for entrepreneurial succession among fifty middle-class Mexican-origin business owners in El Paso, Texas, between 2009 and 2012, at the tail of the Great Recession and its aftermath. Findings reveal that business owners conveyed optimism about withstanding the recession and entrepreneurial succession; however, limited wealth belied that optimism, triggering downsizing that weakened the stability and solvency of their businesses. Ultimately, the Great Recession had a negative impact on the wealth accumulation and business performance of middle-class Mexican-origin entrepreneurs, with observed differences by gender. This study challenges traditional assumptions that entrepreneurship is associated with wealth creation and entrepreneurial succession, underscoring the need to consider how structural forces in the economy condition the entrepreneurial outcomes and economic integration of immigrants and their descendants.",

In subSaharan Africa, documented instances of weakly enforced statutory laws and outdated or misaligned customary laws create a space for practices that undermine the fair and smooth transition of wealth across generations. Purpose This study presents data drawn from a larger mixedmethods study that evaluated a succession (inheritance) curriculum offered in a farming community in Kenya. Approach and Methods A subset of intervention participants ( n = 58) ranging in age from 20 to 78 were invited to participate in posttest focus group discussions. Discussions followed a semistructured interview guide and included questions that evaluated the succession curriculum. Findings In addition to evaluating the intervention, emerging conversations centred on the economic and sociocultural significance of intergenerationally held family wealth. The narrative from these focus groups underscores the importance the community places on familyheld wealth and how failures in the financial socialization process have compromised the generational wealthtransfer system. Further, both younger and older participants identified youth unemployment and substance misuse as factors that have led to a breakdown in the wealthtransfer process. This breakdown can and has resulted in the loss of household wealth, as well as in the marginalization of vulnerable individuals including women and children. Implications This article concludes by identifying mutable factors that have implications for economic empowerment policies and programmes. This includes strengthening parental financial capabilities and facilitating access to legal resources to facilitate wealth transfers.",

If the fertility is the same across income groups, population growth does not influence the basic dynamics of the economy. With, however, the fertility difference, population growth plays a crucial role in characterizing the intergenerational mobility. Suppose, in particular, that the fertility of the educated is higher than that of the uneducated. Then the share of the educated increases sharply due to the fertility difference. This sharp increase largely raises the average wage in the economy, which in turn boosts the education cost. The large increase in the education cost facilitates downwards mobility, and hence decreases the population share of the educated. Thus, if the fertility difference is large enough, the mobility exhibits cyclical behaviour. In contrast, if the fertility of the uneducated is higher than or equal to that of the educated, the same dynamics as in appears.",

    "606": "Increased focus on economic efficiency in formulating tax policy, at the expense of achieving equity, has resulted in decreased rate progressivity in our individual income tax. This decrease has exacerbated inequality. There are several explanations for the intense focus on efficiency and reduced emphasis on equity. Predictions of efficiency gains from low individual income tax rates appear more certain than equity gains from progressive tax rates. Efficiency gains seem measurable, while equity gains appear intangible and unquantifiable. In addition, distributive justice, which underlies and shapes tax equity, exists in many abstract forms, some of which may not require progressive tax rates.This Article argues, however, that the emphasis on efficiency is misplaced. Inequality imposes measurable costs on the health, social well-being, and intergenerational mobility of our citizens, as well as on our democratic process. This is corroborated by significant empirical analysis. In contrast, empirical analysis shows that anticipated efficiency gains from low individual tax rates are speculative. A consensus exists among economists that taxes within the historical range of rates in the United States have little or no impact on labor supply. Moreover, economists cannot agree whether the myriad empirical studies on savings indicate that progressive tax rates decrease, increase, or have no impact on savings in the United States.The clear harms arising from inequality and the uncertain harms arising from progressive tax rates, strongly support always giving equity at least equal weight with efficiency in formulating tax policy. But given the high level of inequality in the United States and the currently low and flat tax rate structure, equity should be given more weight than efficiency at this time. Emphasizing equity in a progressive individual income tax will contribute to the health and economic mobility of our citizens, as well as the stability of our democracy",

While economists and political scientists have written books over the past forty years or so squarely addressing inheritance, I am aware of only one sustained examination of the subject by a philosopher: D. W. Hasletts Capitalism with Morality (Oxford: Oxford University ) In his excellently argued and highly original new book, The Inheritance of Wealth, Daniel Halliday effectively fills that gap.Hallidays main contention is that it is necessary to effectively tax inheritances or bequests because they are flows of unearned wealth, which over time lead to the type of economic segregation or inequality that is corrosive to a fair and equal society. The Rawlsian tone of this argument is unmistakable, and that is something Halliday acknowledges up frontin fact, he claims that one of his main aims is to explain why Rawls was right to call for the taxation of bequest and inheritance (3) If inheritance is a flow of wealth through families, then, when it is not properly taxed, it allows for the dynastic succession of wealth and the creation of a privileged class with the power to undermine the structure of a fair society.A more subtly argued, but no less important, point of the book is Hallidays claim that when properly taxed, inheritance and bequest can play important roles in upward social mobility and securing a fair capitalist market system. Fundamental to this position is his endorsement of a Rignano tax, which works by taxing inherited wealth progressively according to its age or, more specifically, the number of times it has been passed down. Halliday contends that the implementation of a Rignano tax will prevent dynastic concentrations of wealth while at the same time protecting incentives for productive work and allowing inheritance to serve as a vehicle for the upward social mobility of poor families. Although the Rignano tax seems appropriately sensitive to work and savings incentives, it is rather less clear that it will prove effective in preventing dynastic concentrations of wealth because it appears to allow the process to begin, a point I expand on below.The Inheritance of Wealth begins with two chapters largely devoted to analyzing historical approaches to the issue of inheritance and bequest. Although these chapters are primarily preparatory, they are especially enlightening because, apart from the usual characters such as Smith, Locke, and Mill, the views of other lesser-known figures such as William Godwin, Eugenio Rignano, and Josiah Wedgwood are also canvassed. As evidenced by the fact that Halliday adopts Rignanos tax proposal, he is appreciative of the advances made by an earlier generation of theorists, even if he rightly criticizes some of the underlying presumptions and motivations of those accounts.A later chapter entitled Libertarianisms, though less central to the main argument, is also of considerable value for the manner in which Halliday constructively engages a school of thought that in its right-leaning versions is almost always opposed to the taxation of inheritance or bequest. The central claim of this chapter is that a robust capitalist system in which economic rights and freedoms are secured is best protected when there is real competition and an effective dispersal of wealth and power. The proper taxation of inheritance and bequest, especially if structured along the lines of a Rignano tax, plays an important role in the creation and sustainment of those conditions. Consequently, there is little reason for libertarians to reject inheritance taxation outright. Moreover, a tax on bequest or inheritance seems preferable to other, more intrusive forms of taxation on labor income. In the end, Halliday does a nice job of attempting to bridge the gap between liberal egalitarian and (soft/economic) libertarian approaches to inheritance.However, the heart of the argument occurs in chapters 4, 5, and 6, where Halliday diagnoses the injustice of improperly regulated inheritance as arising from its causal role in the unwarranted creation of economic segregation. Drawing inspiration from Pierre Bourdieu, Halliday claims that wealth attracts valuable nonfinancial capital such as exclusive opportunities, access to influential social networks, knowledge of social systems or institutions, and important cultural or behavioral norms that confer significant advantages on their possessors. When a small group in society substantially controls important forms of nonfinancial capital, pernicious status hierarchies can develop as a result. Inherited or bequeathed wealth plays a fundamental role in this process by serving as a vehicle by which nonfinancial capital is horded and maintained by an elite group through the intergenerational transfer of substantial financial wealth.This argument is a real strength of the book because it responds to an oft-repeated objection that bequests and inheritances are typically received too late in life to have any appreciable impact on peoples opportunity set or social standing. Once inheritance is conceptualized as a flow of wealth over time, that objection no longer has any force. A future inheritor need not actually possess the wealth to benefit from the nonfinancial capital that the family has accumulated as a result of holding the wealth over time. In other words, if substantial wealth has existed in the family for a couple of generations or more, then nonfinancial capital will have accrued to the family so that the eventual beneficiary will already have reaped significant social advantages before the bequeathed wealth even arrives.Another point in favor of this account is the way that it insightfully combines luck and social egalitarian justifications of taxation. What makes inheritance unjust is not simply that it is contingent, la luck egalitarianism, or that, per social egalitarianism, it may be a cause of social distinctions, but rather that it is an arbitrary cause of privilege that ultimately ends up grounding unacceptable status hierarchies. So basically, the problem with untaxed inheritance or bequest is that it generates inequality that has no good justification. This argument grants Halliday the space to claim that inheritance is acceptable when it is properly taxed since, instead of generating objectionable inequality, it could serve as a vehicle for upward mobility among poor families by enabling them to gain the wealth and nonfinancial capital they need for increased opportunity. As Halliday states, first-generation inheritance may be a valuable means of promoting upward mobility there is nothing wrong with wealth attracting valuable nonfinancial capital if this is what enables people to get out of poverty (154).Although Hallidays argument is convincing, his position could be further bolstered by appealing to the idea of social solidarity. Since Halliday is worried about the way that economic segregation can lead to the poor being demonized as lazy or somehow deserving of their situation (113) an appeal to solidarity would appear to usefully complement Hallidays approach. Severe economic segregation and the demonization narratives that accompany it clearly run against social solidarity and a supportive community ethos because they treat a segment of the population as unworthy of social concern. So, unregulated bequest or inheritance not only allows certain groups to monopolize superior life prospects for their members (101; emphasis mine) as Halliday claims, but also hinders the development of a community ethos and a sense of mutual concern. In contrast, an effective tax on large bequests or inheritances would display a commitment to solidarity since the tax would allow unearned wealth to be invested back into the community through various educational and social programs. Therefore, the inclusion of solidarity within the justificatory framework of Hallidays argument would provide an alternative (broadly moral, but nonjuridical) source of warrant for the taxation of bequest that is consistent with his concerns about the social mobility of the poor.The largest quibble I have with the book, however, is the more practical claim that a Rignano tax will effectively prevent the dynastic concentration of wealth and the inequality that accompanies such an occurrence. Hallidays support for a Rignano scheme is primarily motivated by two concerns: (1) the existence of economic segregation and (2) a concern not to disincentivize entrepreneurial activity or investment saving. A Rignano scheme purportedly addresses both concerns because it chips away at an original inheritance as it is passed down through the generations, thus purportedly preventing the dynastic accumulation of financial and nonfinancial capital. However, since any newly created wealth can initially be passed on free from taxation or at a significantly lower rate, the Rignano scheme does not disincentivize wealth creation or entrepreneurial activity.To illustrate using Hallidays example (62) imagine an individual G1 who leaves $100 to her offspring G2 with a Rignano tax scheme in place with rates that increase from 0 percent to 50 percent and then to 100 percent per iteration. Because G1 generated the $100, she can pass it on tax free to G2. However, when G2 wants to bequeath the $100, it will incur a 50 percent tax. Hence, unless G2 creates additional wealth beyond the original $100, G3 will only receive $50. Assuming that G3 creates no additional wealth, her bequest will be taxed at 100 percent and G4 will receive nothing. According to Halliday, this prevents the dynastic succession of wealth and helps to limit economic segregation because families will not be able to use inherited wealth to ensure the maintenance of their nonfinancial capital.But I worry that in contrast to a more traditional tax that is strongly financially progressive, a Rignano scheme allows economic segregation to start. This concern is borne out even in the extreme example of the Rignano scheme just discussed, and it is likely to be even more pronounced in real-world examples where the step-up would be expected to be less severe. The problem is that G1 can pass on all of her estate (or G2 can inherit all of G1s bequest) tax free, or at least at a substantially reduced rate. This means that both G2 and G3 are likely to gain substantial benefits from G1. G2 is likely to benefit from the general wealth of her parent(s) and the economic cushion that an inheritance will provide, while G3 is likely to be in a position to also benefit from nonfinancial capital that would have had two generations of time to develop. Importantly, as Halliday notes, sociologists have shown that the wealth of a persons grandparents is a better predictor of the persons lifetime income than the wealth of her parents. This grandparent effect (123) is likely to enhance the position of G4 as well since, even though she will inherit nothing, her grandparent was G2, who did inherit a substantial sum. It could even be surmised that G5 will remain in a privileged socioeconomic position given that his grandparents were G3, who still inherited something of substance. Furthermore, all of the foregoing still assumes that the generations following the initial bequest/inheritance did not use that inheritance to further grow their wealth. If a significant inheritance provides socioeconomic advantages, then it is likely that some of the later generations will have used those advantages to grow their wealth. So, I am not convinced that a Rignano scheme will effectively prevent the type of dynastic succession and economic segregation that Halliday is worried about.In contrast to a robust Rignano scheme, a strong, financially progressive inheritance tax prevents G1 from transferring a large portion of her wealth to G2 in the first place. It therefore prevents the chain of transmission from getting started. Hence, it would likely prove more effective in limiting the development of economic segregation. Moreover, even though the tax is financially progressive, that fact does not mean that G2 cannot inherit enough to help her or her progeny escape poverty, if they were poor. Certainly, a progressive tax could be calibrated to allow persons to inherit moderate amounts of wealth.Of course, a strongly financially progressive tax could potentially damage incentives for savings and work activity. For example, if G1 is aware that any substantial bequest will be heavily taxed, then she may lack the motivation to work and save as diligently as she would have otherwise. However, this worry is likely to be overstated. There is some good evidence suggesting that the possibility of bequeathing wealth has very little impact on peoples work, savings, and consumption behavior (see, e.g. Christopher D. Carroll, Why Do the Rich Save So Much? in Does Atlas Shrug? The Economic Consequences of Taxing the Rich, ed. Joel B. Slemrod [New York: Russell Sage ] 46584) And Halliday himself is critical of the idea that an inheritance tax will lead to appreciable declines in savings (17883) But even if it is assumed that a robust inheritance tax damages the incentive for work and savings, that would not yield a particularly strong argument against instituting a robust tax. If the overriding normative concern is to prevent economic segregation and the best way to do that is through a progressive tax structure, then it is probably worthwhile to accept a small diminution in savings or work in return for greater material and social equality.To be fair to Halliday, he never directly argues against the principle of financial progressivity, and he is open to the possibility of combining financial progressivity with the Rignano principle of progressivity through time (8, 65) His argument is directed more toward the idea of reducing the power and influence of old money, to which a Rignano tax is uniquely sensitive. Nevertheless, I would still emphasize the importance of financial progressivity in preventing the start of any possible dynastic succession of wealth and nonfinancial capital. A Rignano scheme seems a weaker, second-best option on that matter.If there is a tangible benefit of a Rignano scheme, it would seem to lie in the realm of political messaging. In many English-speaking countries, inheritance taxes have been eliminated or rendered defunct. For instance, in the United States individual testators are granted an exemption of up to $11.4 million, and there are currently no federal or state taxes in Australia. A common explanation for this situation is that voters simply think that it is unfair that their hard-earned life savings are taxed. Since in a Rignano scheme tax is paid only on previously inherited wealth, what an individual earns and saves him- or herself could be passed on to the persons offspring or friends tax free. This would seemingly render the institution of the tax more palatable to everyday citizens, and it would enable some meaningful form of taxation to start again.Overall, The Inheritance of Wealth presents a robust justification for the taxation of inheritance or bequest, one that easily overcomes the myriad objections that have been leveled at that form of taxation. In that vein, it provides philosophers, policy makers, and the general public with a clear prescription for a fairer, more effective system of taxation and, indeed, a more just society. And although I am less sympathetic to a Rignano tax scheme than Halliday, he deserves credit for bringing renewed attention to it and demonstrating how the scheme could serve as an important tool for liberal egalitarian theorists. Ultimately, there is little doubt that the book will serve as the foundation for much further normative theorizing on the topic of inherited wealth.

It looks at two ways in which it could be said to do thatby allocating wealth and prestige according to merit, and by creating opportunities for those born in low income familiesand concludes that the first only creates the appearance of fairness (an argument made persuasively by John Rawls) and the second is a largely unfulfilled promise. The author asks whether the low levels of social mobility in Britain and America are because they have not yet become fullyfledged meritocracies, or because they have, and considers Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murrays argument in The Bell Curve that meritocratic societies have a tendency to degenerate into geneticallybased caste systems.

    "640": "While Koreas compressed development has enriched and bolstered the economy, the social system still leaves much to be desired. The reason for this shortcoming lies within a short history of capitalism and growth-oriented policies that sacrifice distribution. The end of Koreas accelerated growth and ensuing sharp drop in social mobilitywhich drove the dynamics of Korean societyhave incited growing concern over income inequality and inherited wealth. As a result, more and more people have begun to recognize the need for redistribution policies to resolve the socioeconomic inequality. The problem is, however, how much redistribution policy will meet the peoples expectations? As evidenced by the controversies over the policies for free school meals and half-price tuition from 2010, and by the response to the various redistribution policies of the Moon Jae-in administration, Koreans are highly divided in their opinions about the level of redistribution. Nonetheless, little effort has been made to understand the degree to which views differ, and to discover the factors that lead to such conflict. Rather, debates over policy are overly focused on theoretical justification, which has served to escalate social tension, and there have been no substantial moves towards building social consensus on distributive justice. The policies of a democracy are not justified by abstract goals and political rhetoric, but through the peoples support. Thus, a good grasp is first needed of the wide array of public opinion. This study aims to highlight this issue. The starting point of this study is the recognition that individuals have rational reasons for their preference for redistribution. Accordingly, Chapter 2 investigates the basic theories on the determinants of the preference for redistribution to ascertain these reasons. It introduces different theoretical bases and related studies on economic factors, such as income level, possibility of upward mobility (POUM) past experiences, and externalities of inequality, along with sociocultural factors, such as political inclination, perception of fairness, social competition, and trust in government. The aim is to create a foundation on which individuals preference for redistribution can be understood. Meanwhile, a review of the discourse on Koreas preference for redistribution reveals that of the many empirical analyses that have been conducted, none have presented concrete fact, but rather, have left room for more controversy. Most notably, the majority of studies contend that Koreas preference for redistribution is unlike those seen in theories and Western countries; which could be owed to the different belief systems and social norms that have formed during Koreas rapid growth. Additionally, it appears as though people have yet to choose a concrete stance in terms of the welfare system and government, and build their expectations. As such, in terms of gaining a better grasp of Koreas preference for redistribution, it is more important to understand what has transpired thus far and to forecast future changes than to look at current cross-sectional characteristics. Chapter 3 delves into the reasons for Koreas unique preference for redistribution. Ironically, although Koreans are readily accepting of market functionsas shown by their relatively positive perception of income generation and wealth expansion, and the fact that income disparity is viewed as compensation for effort rather than an inequalitythey also have a strong preference for government redistribution policies, which distort the outcome of market distribution. This is in direct conflict with general normative relationships. Two types of distributive justice are discussed to find the source of this contradictory normative relationship: micro- and macro-level distributive justice. The former is found in the economic sphere and is a rule that is connected to the specific choices of individuals and organizations, and is based on the principle of differentiating by effort or capability. The latter is found in the political sphere and is a rule that functions under a fully universal and abstract unit (e.g. social structure or system) and is based on the principle of equality which aims to strengthen universality and protect the vulnerable population. The focus of the empirical analysis has been placed on how people select a distributive justice. Specifically, the treatment of both forms of distributive justice are compared based on progressive political inclination. The results reveal that the progressive inclination in East Asia (including Korea) and Transition countries bolsters the demand for redistribution in the government sector, while also establishing positive opinions about market functions in the market sector. This is possible because their market norms incorporate progressive social values that root out outdated practices; which implies that, although they remain incomplete, micro- and macro-level distributive justice can both be pursued at the same time. As a result, Koreans exhibit a unique preference for redistribution that is based on dual expectations and differs from those seen in Europe, where governments redress the failures of the market, and in the US, where the market has absolute superiority. However, as it can be seen through the Korean case, a divided perception structure does not always indicate a stable balance. This is because, as individuals acquire more experience of the market and government, the links begin to appear and they realize that the market requires a level of state intervention (sacrifice of or damage to micro-level distributive justice) to secure the resources that are needed for redistribution (realization of macro-level distributive justice) Thus, it is possible that Koreas strong preference is a transitional characteristic that manifests itself during the development of capitalism. Meanwhile Chapter 4 provides an overview of the recent developments in the preference for redistribution among Koreans and the reasons for the changes using the World Value Survey (WVS) wave 7 which was conducted in 2017. The results reveal that, firstly, Koreas preference for redistribution has changed drastically since 2010 with the preference for redistribution sharply waning and polarizing due to the conflict between political inclinations, increasing generational gaps, and changing social perceptions owing to tensions between political factions. In terms of political inclination, although the spectrum widened after the impeachment of President Park in 2016-2017, it does not provide an explanation for why the preference for redistribution has become polarized. Furthermore, given that this polarization appears for all generations, the generational gap also appears not to be a direct cause. Meanwhile, there is an increasing trend in the negative perceptions of market functions and fairness, resulting in a bimodal structure that is similar to the one seen in the preference for redistribution. To look more closely at the factors that impact the preference for redistribution, an analysis is conducted using a time-interaction term model which finds that economic factors and social perception have the biggest influence as an increasing number of individuals base their opinions on economic conditions, such as income level and type of employment, and as social perceptions of the market and fairness change. In particular, we can see that the preference for redistribution is moving closer towards contemporary theoretical explanations as the interaction term of the variable YI (positive view of market functions; competition is beneficial) shifts to negative range. This result also supports the discussion in Chapter 3 that the dual pursuit of micro- and macro-level distributive justice in Korea is a transitional phenomenon. Finally, Chapter 5 reviews the policy implications. The key point is that, instead of recognizing it as a matter of right and wrong, the government should approach redistribution policies with an open mind, and be ready to listen to different opinions in order to broaden the foundations to build social consensus. Unlike Western countries, Korea lacks a universal principle which means that, when final decisions are made by society through a majority vote without social consensus, it may deepen the divide and weaken the base required to achieve social consensus. In particular, the government should turn way from party politics and trying to justify its redistribution policies, and make efforts to persuade the people in a prudent manner. Efforts are also needed to encourage stakeholders and experts to participate in the policymaking process to ensure that more accurate predictions are available about the impact of such policies while controversial issues are avoided to prevent unnecessary social tension. Lastly, ample information must be provided and opinions coordinated so that the people are able to understand the broader context.",

By making the risk of human capital investment more acceptable, especially to low wealth households, subsidies may increase investment in human capital, lower long-run inequality, and reduce aggregate precautionary savings. However, subsidies also encourage more poorly prepared students to attend and are usually financed via distortionary taxes. In this paper, we find that observed collegiate subsidies improve welfare substantially relative to the fully decentralized (zero subsidy) outcome. We show that subsidies help smooth consumption, lower skill premia, increase interest rates as precautionary savings fall, lower the inequality of both consumption and wealth, increase intergenerational income mobility and raise welfare, even when financed by distortionary taxes.",
    "648": "As a main source of educational input, the household education expenditure has a positive impact on the accumulation of childrens human capital. In recent years, the education expenditure in Chinese families has increased rapidly. Existing literature has explained this phenomenon from different aspects, including the status seeking motive, raising sons for old age, and parents pure altruism. In this paper, we suggest that an alternative explanation may be at work: the education expenditure in Chinese families may be affected by their neighbors, namely the neighborhood effect. We note that there is a shortage of literature giving an explanation for the rising education expenditure in Chinese families from this perspective. On the one hand, China is a country with strong cultural tightness and laying great emphasis on collectivism. For this reason, Chinese peoples thoughts and behaviors are easily affected by others and tend to be convergent in a group. On the other hand, Chinese families generally attach great importance to education. They often regard education, especially tertiary education as an important way to achieve intergenerational mobility and improve families social status. In a competence-based higher education selection system, whether a child can get the access to higher education depends on the relative position of his her academic performance, and the household education expenditure is a key factor in determining childrens academic performance. In order to guarantee childrens educational opportunities, the education expenditure in other families within a social group will be an important element that families need to take into account when making decisions on their own household educational expenditure. Therefore, the education expenditure in Chinese families is possibly affected by other families within a social group. In this paper, we define families living in a village in rural areas or a community in cities as neighbors, and empirically analyze whether there is a neighborhood effect in Chinese household education expenditure decisions by using data from the China Family Panel and Following Studies CFPS from 2010 to 2014. As illustrated by some relevant literature, identifying the neighborhood effect is usually complicated by the problem of the residential sorting effect which refers to a phenomenon that households may self-select into the community with whom they associate. We alleviate this problem by limiting our research samples to rural Chinese households due to the special hukou system, controlling more variables which may affect residents selecting of communities, and matching a virtual neighbor to city households based on the Mahalanobis distance.The empirical findings indicate that the average community education expenditure has a positive impact on the household education expenditure. With 1% increase in the community education expenditure, the household education expenditure will increase by 0.307% The results also show that the estimated effect cannot be driven by the residential sorting effect, households in a community facing identical educational policies and sharing the same access to information. We further analyze the relevant influencing mechanisms and find that in rural samples, the widening of income disparities between the middle and the high income groups and between the middle and the low income groups will make the household education expenditure more sensitive to the average community education expenditure. This indicates that the status seeking motive serves as an important mechanism for the neighborhood effect to work in rural households. In city samples, we find that both the status seeking motive and the convergence of the importance that residents attach to education are not the influencing mechanisms for the neighborhood effect to work in city households. This paper provides a new perspective to understand the increasing household education expenditure in Chinese households in recent years.",

The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 for Children and Young Adults (NLSY79 CY) were used. A total of 4,224 dyads were selected and the mediation model was conducted. Single mothers poverty was related to low income and depression among their young adult children. The relationship between mothers poverty and their young adult childrens depression was partially mediated by their young adult childrens income. Poverty prevention or reduction programs for female-headed households should be provided to single mothers to reduce future levels of depression among their young adults. Improving inequality in intergenerational economic mobility is one way to address depressive symptoms among the young adult children of single mothers in poverty.",
    "663": "In a pension system with uniform policies for contribution and accrual, each participant has the same contribution rate and accrual rate independent of the age at the time of payment. Although a common practice for public sector pension plans in many countries, this is not actuarially fair because the investment horizon of young participants is longer than the investment horizon of the elderly. We show the unintended redistributive intergenerational effects of a uniform contribution system and the consequences of switching from uniform policies to an actuarially fair system, first analytically in a stylized model with three overlapping generations. We then quantify these effects in a detailed model with multiple overlapping generations, realistic parameters and detailed information on the income distribution, calibrated on the Dutch funded pension system. Our base estimate shows that the transition effect of abolishing uniform policies for an actuarially fair system is about 37 billion euros (5% of the Dutch GDP) for an interest rate of 1% (the market interest rate ultimo 2017) but only 11 billion euro for an interest rate of 0% (the market interest rate as of July 2019) For each cohort, the redistributive effects are less than 5% of their total pension. We show that a system with uniform policies implies a transfer of about 10 billion euros from poor to rich.",
    "665": "Does the way scholars measure inequality of opportunity correspond to how people perceive it? What other factors influence individual perception of this phenomenon? To answer these questions we must first clarify how scholars define and measure inequality of opportunity. We discuss the possible mechanisms linking objective measures to subjective perception of the phenomenon, then propose a measure of perceived inequality of opportunity, and finally test our hypothesis by merging data coming from two sources: the European Union Statistics on Income and Living and the International Social Survey We suggest that the prevailing perception of the degree of unequal opportunity in a large sample of respondents is only weakly correlated with its objective measure. We estimate a multilevel model considering both individual and country level controls to explain individual perception of unequal opportunity. Our estimates suggest that the two most adopted measures of inequality of opportunity have not clear role in explaining its perception. Conversely, other country level variables and personal experiences of intergenerational social mobility are important determinants of how inequality of opportunity is perceived.",
    "675": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the properties of the variable elasticity of substitution (VES) production function, and examine the dynamics of growth associated with it. Design/methodology/approach The VES production function is incorporated into an otherwise standard Diamond overlapping generations model. Findings Depending on parameter combinations, the economy can achieve a unique and stable steady state akin to that observed in the Solow-Swan model, reach a poverty trap or transition towards an upper bound of per capita capital stock. A special case of the VES production function is also consistent with unbounded growth. Research limitations/implications The paper is theoretical in nature. Further empirical analysis could shed deeper insights into the results presented in this study. Practical implications The VES production function, when applied to the context of the Diamond model, can capture a variety of growth experiences observed in the empirical literature. Social implications In the context of the Diamond model, a higher value of a particular parameter in the production function leads to greater intergenerational income and consumption inequality. Hence, the study provides a potential explanation for intergenerational inequalities observed in practice. Originality/value The study demonstrates the empirical value of the VES production function in explaining observed differences in factor shares, rewards and elasticities within and between countries over time.",

In a world in which redistributive policies, whether fiscal or educational, affect how the entire economy breaks up into different communities, we find multiple politico-economic regimes that are supported by new international empirical evidence. In particular, we highlight a political economy decision mechanism through which the pressure for redistribution can be highly non linear therefore providing an explanation as to why more inequality can be associated with less, rather than more, redistributive taxation. Our framework displays multiple steady states which depend on historical economic discrimination. We also provide sufficient conditions on the initial pattern of income distribution and local versus social spillovers ratio under which inequality and segregation persist in the long run.",
    "677": "INTRODUCTIONWealth inequality endangers democratic values and calls for a public response.1 Acknowledging the problem, Janet Yellen, Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, recently presented evidence that [t]he distribution of income and wealth in the United States has been widening more or less steadily for several decades, to a greater extent than in most advanced countries.2 This gap, she observed, is as wide as it has been in a hundred years and undermines efforts to achieve a meaningful equality of opportunity.3 The nation's top 0.1% alone is worth approximately as much as the bottom 90%.4How did we reach this state of affairs? Although the Constitution prohibits inherited titles and other perquisites of nobility,5 nothing in the logic of capitalism prevents the accumulation of vast, intractable disparities in wealth.6 Indeed, concentrated economic power can be self-perpetuating.7 This Article contends that family businesses merit special scrutiny as a potential source of inequality because they combine two of society's most important economic institutions: family and business.8 As such, family businesses implicate concerns regarding both inherited wealth and the concentration of economic power made possible by the corporate form.Typically, owners seek to increase family wealth, to provide employment for family members, and, ultimately, to transfer control to a new generation of family owners.9 Nor are these kinship preferences inconsequential.10 The ten wealthiest families in the U.S. derive their fortune from a family-business venture.11 Federal Reserve Chair Yellen further observes that the wealthiest Americans are much more likely than their fellow citizens to have shares in private, often family-owned businesses.12 More general assessments of the prevalence of family ownership vary, but all commentators agree that family businesses play a major role in the economy.13 According to one estimate, [f]amily dominated businesses comprise more than 80 percent of U.S. enterprises, employ more than 50 percent of the nation's workforce, and account for the bulk of America's gross domestic product.14Despite their economic importance, little has been done to investigate whether family businesses contribute to wealth inequality. This Article offers the first legal,15 and one of the only academic, treatments of the topic,16 and it shows that family businesses play a double role. On the one hand, family businesses can entrench existing disparities in wealth and opportunity. Heirs, after all, stand to benefit from the hard work of previous generations. On the other hand, family businesses can be a powerful antidote to inequality. By facilitating the accumulation of capital, family businesses can disrupt entrenched class hierarchies and create opportunities for individuals, families, and ethnic communities.17 As one court observed, small businesses have been for many immigrant groups, and continue to be, the first rung on the ladder of American success.18This Article concludes that whether family businesses produce net social costs or benefits depends crucially on two principal factors. First, to the extent there is a lack of public investment in social mobility, family businesses can increase the distribution of wealth by providing needed investments in human capital. Second, to the extent the rewards of capitalism are not widely shared, family businesses can offer a source of opportunity, not just for family members, but also for employees and the communities in which family businesses operate. Thus, family businesses should not be viewed in isolation; a comprehensive response to the problem of wealth inequality must involve the state, the family, and the market.19This Article proceeds as follows. Part I describes the problem of wealth inequality but argues that proposals to curtail inherited wealth should not overlook the role family businesses play in creating opportunities.",
    "681": "We review studies of the impact of credit constraints on the accumulation of human capital. Evidence suggests that credit constraints have recently become important for schooling and other aspects of households' behavior. We highlight the importance of early childhood investments, as their response largely determines the impact of credit constraints on the overall lifetime acquisition of human capital. We also review the intergenerational literature and examine the macroeconomic impacts of credit constraints on social mobility and the income distribution. A common limitation across all areas of the human capital literature is the imposition of ad hoc constraints on credit. We propose a more careful treatment of the structure of government student loan programs and the incentive problems underlying private credit. We show that endogenizing constraints on credit for human capital helps explain observed borrowing, schooling, and default patterns and offers new insights about the design of government policy.",
    "686": "Reviewing the data regarding effects of student debt on students financial outcomes following college whether successful graduation or premature exit makes clear that there is a price to pay for having to borrow money to go to college. Indebted college graduates have lower net worth, less home equity, and compromised ability to accumulate assets, as compared to their peers with the same level of education but no student debt. They may also experience poorer educational outcomes, with independent effects on earning power and, then, later wealth accumulation. Especially given the relationship between initial household wealth and children's later educational outcomes, these findings about the postcollege financial outcomes of indebted students and graduates raise the specter of ongoing, sustained, and crossgenerational perpetuation of societal divides. In the United States, higher education is valued not just as a good in itself, but also as a means to the end of greater economic security and the primary lever for economic mobility. Evaluating student loans through this lens underscores the longterm, volatile, and often hidden effects of student loan dependence and raises the stakes for consideration of alternative approaches to higher education finance.",
    "690": "This paper uncovers differences in social mobility between rich and poor families. The paper shows, in particular, that borrowing constraints retard social mobility among the poor by preventing poor parents from investing optimally in the their children's human capital. This evidence contradicts several recent studies that argue that innate ability is the overriding determinant of socioeconomic success in the United States. The paper also shows that siblings' inequality seems to be independent of family wealth, which clearly contradicts the predictions of most economic models of resource allocation within the family.",
    "691": "argued that policies ending racial discrimination would not equalize opportunity without addressing residential sorting and neighborhood externalities. This paper studies related counterfactual policies using an overlapping-generations dynamic general equilibrium model of residential sorting and intergenerational human capital accumulation. In the model, households choose where to live and how much to invest toward the production of their child's human capital. The return on parents' investment is determined in part by the child's ability and in part by an externality determined by the human capital in their neighborhood. We calibrate the model with two neighborhoods and neighborhood-specific production technologies to data from Chicago when mobility was restricted by race. We then conduct three numerical experiments by eliminating the restriction on neighborhood choice, equalizing production technologies, or both. We find that allowing residential mobility generates persistent income inequality, even when technologies are equalized across neighborhoods. Equalizing technologies only equalizes opportunity for residents in the originally segregated neighborhood when high-income households reside there. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at improving outcomes in impoverished areas should feature incentives for high-income households to stay or migrate into the neighborhood.",
    "696": "Increased focus on economic efficiency in formulating tax policy, at the expense of achieving equity, has resulted in decreased rate progressivity in our individual income tax. This decrease has exacerbated inequality.&#x0D; There are several explanations for the intense focus on efficiency and reduced emphasis on equity. Predictions of efficiency gains from low individual income tax rates appear more certain than equity gains from progressive tax rates. Efficiency gains seem measurable, while equity gains appear intangible and unquantifiable. In addition, distributive justice, which underlies and shapes tax equity, exists in many abstract forms, some of which may not require progressive tax rates.&#x0D; This Article argues, however, that the emphasis on efficiency is misplaced. Inequality imposes measurable costs on the health, social well-being, and intergenerational mobility of our citizens, as well as on our democratic process. This is corroborated by significant empirical analysis.&#x0D; In contrast, empirical analysis shows that anticipated efficiency gains from low individual tax rates are speculative. A consensus exists among economists that taxes within the historical range of rates in the United States have little or no impact on labor supply. Moreover, economists cannot agree whether the myriad empirical studies on savings indicate that progressive tax rates decrease, increase, or have no impact on savings in the United States.&#x0D; The clear harms arising from inequality and the uncertain harms arising from progressive tax rates, strongly support always giving equity at least equal weight with efficiency in formulating tax policy. But given the high level of inequality in the United States and the currently low and flat tax rate structure, equity should be given more weight than efficiency at this time. Emphasizing equity in a progressive individual income tax will contribute to the health and economic mobility of our citizens, as well as the stability of our democracy.",
    "704": "This paper examines theoretically how economic growth affects intergenerational economic mobility. In the model developed in this paper, education is provided to the individuals free of cost, and admission to schools is competitive. The quantity of educational services available in any period depends on the total output of the economy in the same period. Individuals differ from each other in two respects. First, their innate mental abilities are determined by a stochastic process, and, second, their parents have different education levels. Individuals are admitted to schools based on their potential. An individual's potential is a function of her innate mental ability and her parent's education level.In this model, economic growth increases intergenerational economic mobility if and only if the effect of having an educated parent on an individual's potentetial is not large. Moreover, if the effect of having an educated parent is not large, then there exists a unique steady state equilibrium and all economies will progress toward increased mobility. The model also shows that economic growth reduces the income difference between educated and uneducated labor if and only if the effect of having an educated parent on an individual's potential is not large. And, although population growth reduces intergenerational economic mobility, technological progress increases it.",

Simultaneously, some Canadian regions have more in common with the low-mobility southern parts of the United States than with the rest of Canada; that these areas represent a much larger fraction of the US population also explains why mobility is lower in the United States.",
    "707": "Money parents give their adult children may be important for the financing of a child's education or a first home, relaxing binding credit constraints or responding to a transitory income shock. Financial transfers however, may extend economic disparities across generations if the wealthy transfer considerable resources to their children while middle class and poor households do not. In this paper, we first examine annual gifts of money from parents to adult children in the United States and ten European countries using the 2004 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) Second, utilizing the long panel of the HRS, we study the long-run behavior of parental monetary giving to children across families and within a family. We found that in all countries, some parents gave money to children, many did not, the amount was low, about 500 Euros annually per child, and varied by parental socio-economic status and public social expenditures. In the short term, parents in the U.S. gave money to a child to compensate for low earnings or satisfy an immediate need such as schooling. Over sixteen years, parents gave an average of about $38,000 to all their children, five percent gave over $140,000 and gave persistently. With time, the amount of money children in the same family received became more equal and a child's level of education was one of the few remaining sources of differences in money given to children. Overall, the annual amount of money parents gave adult children in any country was not enough to affect the distribution of resources within or between families in the next generation although the timing of transfers for schooling or housing may have a significant impact on an individual child. Annual parental transfers for college age children in school in the U.S. were substantially higher than average transfers to all children. The effect of parental transfers for higher education on intergenerational mobility in the U.S. will depend in part upon whether this financing is essential in the schooling decision.",
    "712": "On average, children from less economically privileged households have lower levels of educational attainment than their higher income peers, and this association has important implications for intergenerational mobility and equality of opportunity. Using a large national data set that recently added information on genetic markers, this paper shows that the income-achievement relationship varies greatly across groups of children with different versions of a single gene, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) For children with one variant of MAOA, increases in household income have the expected large positive association with college enrollment, college graduation, and total years of schooling completed. For children with another variant of MAOA, who comprise over half of the population, there is virtually no relationship between economic background and educational attainment. These results hold when the interactive effects are identified using MAOA variation between full biological siblings, which genetic principles assure is as good as randomly assigned. Implications for policy design and future research are discussed.",
    "715": "Since the founding of our nation, education has been valued as a preeminent means of achieving equal opportunity and the social mobility of democracy. A generation ago, however, Professor John Langbein diagnosed a different function of education: the transmission of wealth from one generation to the next. In this article, I examine education as intergenerational wealth transmission through a critical lens. My primary inquiry is whether the traditional role of education-as-opportunity is being crowded out by education-as-inheritance. The article first examines and verifies Langbeins diagnosis: Education today is indeed an important way to transfer wealth intergenerationally. The article next documents lack of access to education for those without economic resources, a lack of access that extends from birth through college. The article concludes by identifying flagging public investment in education as creating a vacuum that is being filled by the increasingly privatized provision of education. This privatized investment constitutes an indirect but real form of intergenerational wealth transmission, which dampens social mobility. Countering this trend, increasing social mobility will necessitate a shift away from education-as-inheritance toward education-as-opportunity. More progressive public investment at all levels of education is called for to facilitate this shift.",
    "717": "We develop a dynamic model where a competitive firm produces a single good from labor and capital, with market clearing rates of return. Individuals are heterogeneous in skills, with an endowment in capital/wealth increasing in skill. Individuals aspire to a standard consumption level, with a constant marginal propensity to consume out of income above this level. We define a steady state of this model as an equilibrium where factor returns and wealth shares remain constant. We calibrate the model to the US economy and obtain that a steady state exists. We then study three variants of the model: one with a higher rate of return for large capitals than for smaller ones, one with social mobility, and one with a capital levy Financing a lump sum transfer. In all variants, a steady state exists. We also run the model starting from the 2012 US wealth distribution and obtain convergence to the steady state in the basic model as well as in all variants. Convergence takes a long time and is non monotone, with factor returns and wealth shares moving away from their steady state values for long periods.",

The mechanism that we propose is based on the interaction between effort and wealth suggested by the Carnegie effect, according to which wealthier individuals make less effort than the poorer. The oscillations in wealth arise from changes in the effort exerted by different generations as a response to both inherited wealth and college premium. Our mechanism generates a rich social stratification with several classes in the long run as a consequence of the combination of different levels of education and effort. Furthermore, we generate a large mobility in wealth among classes even in the long run. Our model highlights the role played by the minimum cost on education investment, the borrowing constraints, and the complementarity between effort and education.",

    "724": "We use a quasi-experimental design and Swedish administrative data to document that the average heir depletes her inheritance within a decade while the inheritances of wealthy heirs remain intact. These different depletion rates are not due to different consumption or labor supply responses but due to different rates of return on inherited wealth. Upon their receipt, inheritances reduce relative measures of wealth inequality, such as top shares or percentile ratios. Theoretically, this reduction in inequality could be due to either a com-pressed inheritance distribution or similar chances of having wealthy parents (high inter-generational mobility) Empirically, the first force is more significant in Sweden. Within a decade, however, the effect is reversed: inheritances increase wealth inequality since the different depletion rates widen the inequality in inherited wealth over time. This implies that inheritance taxation can reduce long-run wealth inequality only through the taxation of wealthy heirs.",
    "728": "Research has repeatedly argued that increasing the rate at which Black people start businesses could reduce the racial wealth gap between Black and white families, but increasing the rate of Black entrepreneurship may actually exacerbate the racial wealth gap, due to the economic cost associated with business closure. Using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) we find that, as past work suggests, Black-owned businesses are less likely to remain open 4 years later, compared to white-owned businesses, and that, due to this disparity, Black business owners are more likely to experience downward economic mobility and less likely to experience upward mobility, compared to their white counterparts. These results suggest that improving the rate at which Black entrepreneurs succeed, rather than increasing the rate at which Black people become entrepreneurs, should be the target of efforts to leverage business ownership to reduce the racial wealth gap.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s41996-021-00081-6.",
    "730": "We present a first formal, dynamic, economic analysis of reparations using a long-run model of heterogeneous dynasties with an occupational choice and bequests. Our innovation is to introduce endogenous dispersion of beliefs about risky returns, reflecting differences in dynasties' investment experiences over time. Feeding the exclusion of Black dynasties from labor and capital markets as driving force, the model quantitatively reproduces current and historical racial gaps in wealth, income, entrepreneurship, mobility, and beliefs about risky returns. We evaluate whether different forms of reparations compensate for historical exclusions, which means restoring the long-run outcomes we would have observed in the absence of exclusions. We find that direct transfers that eliminate the racial gap in average wealth today do not lead to long-run wealth convergence, which is the long-run outcome without exclusions. The logic is that century-long exclusions lead Black dynasties to enter into reparations with pessimistic beliefs about risky returns and to forego investment opportunities. We show that investment subsidies are more effective than wealth transfers in eliminating the racial wealth gap.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

Drawing on interviews with first time homeowners who had bought property with familial gifts or inheritances, we find that many downplay the intergenerational privilege associated with gifting by reporting extended family histories of working-class struggle, upward social mobility and meritocratic striving. Interviewees also draw boundaries between their own wealth and the less legitimate wealth of others, or dispute the significance of gifting compared to other inequalities. We further argue that gifting is a site where two competing logics, the 'domestic' and family-orientated and the 'civic' and meritocratic, collide. While these competing principles appear to be in conflict, we detail how many labour discursively to bring them into alignment.

We fill this gap by empirically testing the direct and indirect (through economic growth) impacts of economic freedom on intergenerational income mobility. We find that economic freedom has both direct and indirect effects on intergenerational income mobility. Income inequality is also a strong predictor, but of downward income mobility. When we incorporate findings about the purely mechanical relationship between inequality and intergeneration income mobility (e.g. Guner 2015; Berman 2019) we find that the legal system and property rights component of economic freedom matters more than inequality.

    "790": "Theoretical and empirical studies exploring the eects of income in- equality upon growth reach a disappointing inconclusive result. Some recent empirical papers have emphasized that one reason for this ambi- guity could be that income inequality is actually a composite measure of inequality of opportunity (IO) and inequality of eort (IE) These types of inequality would aect growth through opposite channels, so the relationship between inequality and growth would depend on which component is larger. Based on this preliminary empirical result, we build an intergenerational model with human capital of inequality and development. The existence of a trap in the process of human capi- tal accumulation generates multiplicity of equilibria and permits the inclusion of social mobility in the analysis. The model is able to explain how IO and IE aect human capi- tal accumulation and hence ongoing long-run growth. The existence of social mobility in society makes the relationship between income in- equality and growth to be non-linear, and the Onal sign of the inauence of inequality on growth to be dependent on the degree of development and overall inequality of the economy. We Ond that IE is generally beneOcial to human capital accumulation and, therefore, to ongoing growth, while IO positively aects human capital (income) only for less developed economies",
    "793": "The issue of intergenerational transfers is addressed in the context of how families finance college education. Two aspects of the problem are examined: the extent of parental support, and when the funds are allocated, i.e. from earlier saving, from current income or in the form of loans to be repaid in the future. Data are drawn from the 1987 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, which included surveys of both aided and unaided students, college record offices, and a survey of a smaller sample of parents. Interfamily transfers for college education continue to be a major way in which parents contribute to the upward mobility of their children. This support is provided in the form of money, primarily from current income, and in the form of goods and services.",
    "797": "This paper investigates whether aspirations matter for education, which offers a common route out of poverty. We find that mother aspirations are strongly related to the child's grade achieved at age 18. The relation is nonlinear, suggesting there is a threshold, and depends on caste, household income and the village setting. The coefficients remain large and significant when applying control function estimation, using first born son as instrument. A similar strong relation is observed with learning outcomes, including local language, English and maths test results, and with attending school, but not with attending private education. These results are confirmed for outcomes at age 15. The findings provide direct evidence on the contribution of mother aspirations to children's education outcomes and point to aspirations as a channel of intergenerational mobility. They suggest that education outcomes can be improved more rapidly by taking aspirations into account when targeting education programmes, and through interventions that shape aspirations.",

I exploit cohort differences in exposure to equalization generated by state-level reforms. To address the endogeneity of postreform revenues due to household sorting after a reform, I use a simulated-instruments approach that uses newly collected data on states' funding formulas to simulate revenues without sorting. I find that equalization has a large effect on the mobility of low-income students. Reductions in input gaps between low-income and high-income districts are likely channels behind this effect.",
    "800": "Income inequality seems to go hand-in-hand with a lack of intergenerational mobility.This is worrying from a policy perspective since it implies that income differentials persist over time because opportunities to succeed in life are not equally distributed across a society but depend on an individual's social origins.Promoting intergenerational mobility may make societies not only more egalitarian but also more efficient.The expectation that people, whatever their social origins, can raise their standard of living is a powerful incentive to human capital accumulation and individual effort.Policies that counteract disparities in family background, such as educational interventions targeted at the children of the poor, may foster intergenerational mobility.Upward intergenerational income mobility is strongly related to parents' income inequality (US, 1996(US, -2000) )",

While internal migration is associated with social mobility, it can also be used as a strategy of status maintenance among graduates from privileged backgrounds. The aim of this paper is to scrutinize whether internal migration for study or work, and subsequent labour market outcomes, are associated with social origins. Using a rich administrative and survey data set on a cohort of Italian graduates, findings show a substantive effect of social origins on graduates migration for study but not on migration for work. Finally, the results also more tentatively indicate that migration for study is one relevant path connecting social origins and income, thus emphasizing how privilege is not bound to place, but travels.",
    "808": "We present a model where more accurate information on the background of individuals facilitates statistical discrimination, increasing inequality and intergenerational persistence in income. Surprisingly, more accurate information on the actual capabilities of workers leads to the same resultfirms give increased weight to the more accurate information, increasing inequality, which itself fosters discrimination. The rich take advantage of this through educational investments in their children, and mobility decreases as a consequence of an increase in the ability to reward talent. Using our model to interpret the data suggests that a country like the US might indeed be a land of opportunity for the sufficiently able, as conditional on ability background may have relatively little effect. Nevertheless the US has a relatively low degree of intergenerational mobility precisely because meritocracy facilitates a high correlation of ability with background.",
    "811": "This article aims to measure and understand the role of inheritances in shaping wealth inequality. We use a quasi-experimental design and Swedish administrative data to document that the average heir depletes her inheritance within a decade while the inheritances of wealthy heirs remain intact. These different depletion rates are not due to different consumption or labour supply responses but due to different rates of return on inherited wealth. Upon their receipt, inheritances reduce relative measures of wealth inequality, such as top shares or percentile ratios. Theoretically, this reduction in inequality could be due to either a compressed inheritance distribution or similar chances of having wealthy parents (high intergenerational mobility) Empirically, the first force is more significant in Sweden. Within a decade, however, the effect is reversed: inheritances increase wealth inequality since the different depletion rates widen the inequality in inherited wealth over time. This implies that inheritance taxation can reduce long run wealth inequality only through the taxation of wealthy heirs.",
    "816": "Comments Omar Arias and Juliano Assuno Omar Arias: This paper addresses an important but insufficiently studied aspect of the persistent high poverty and inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean. As the authors point out, understanding mobility is very important to identify the determinants of the persistent high levels of inequality in the region. However, the issue has not received adequate attention in terms of data generation, research, and the policy agendas. The United States and other industrialized countries have a long history of studies in this area, although the main focus has been on intergenerational mobility, particularly the extent to which socioeconomic success is transmitted from parents to children. This paper instead focuses on intragenerational income mobility, that is, the changes in a person's income level during his or her adult life course. The authors concentrate on studies that track the evolution of the incomes of the same individuals over time to see who gains and who loses during the economic growth process. This is closely related to the recent literature on pro-poor growth and vulnerability. The paper provides a succinct summary of the current state of knowledge on intragenerational income mobility in the region (largely produced by the authors themselves) documents its importance, and highlights areas for further work. The work should thus be of great interest to development academics and policymakers alike. The paper reviews the main conceptual and practical challenges in measuring intragenerational income mobility with existing data in the region. This includes the possible ambiguities in using alternative mobility measures and the difficulties that measurement error in (noisy) incomes and panel data attrition pose to empirical analysis. The authors suggest possible ways to address these issues, including the advantages and disadvantages of alternative methodologies such as instrumental variables and pseudo-panels. The paper clearly highlights the limitations of panel household survey data in Latin America and the Caribbean and the critical need to expand their use and coverage. Nevertheless, some additional methodological issues are [End Page 144] important for deriving knowledge and policy lessons from existing studies using the few short (one- to two-year) panels available in the region and for advancing research in this important field. First, while mobility measures are useful, much care is warranted in drawing inferences based on such short panels. The evidence from studies such as those surveyed in the paper can establish whether a certain growth pattern (or a crisis) affected individuals differently, particularly those that start out in the low ranks of the income distribution. They are less reliable, however, for inferring whether a given country shows high or low intragenerational income mobility even compared to other countries. One of the key advantages of mobility studies for Latin America is that they allow the analyst to discern how much of the rise in or persistency of the region's high inequality is due to lifetime (or structural) inequality and how much to the volatility in measured annual earnings that inflates cross-sectional inequality. Such calculations cannot be done reliably with existing short panel data. In the case of the United States, studies have reached different conclusions regarding the level and evolution of intragenerational mobility depending on the length of the longitudinal data used to track incomes over time.1 A second and related issue, which is mentioned in passing in the paper given space constraints, is the modeling and interpretation of intragenerational mobility earnings regressions. This is key to gauging the determinants of intragenerational mobility and hence the policy knowledge that can be derived from empirical research such as the Latin American and Caribbean studies reviewed in the paper. The following earnings Mincer equation illustrates the issues:2 where Z and denote the matrices of observable individual characteristics, u and e are the vectors of unobservable attributes, and their respective coefficients are the corresponding income returns. The corresponding change in earnings for the individual over a given period is [End Page 145] This formulation indicates that the change in an individual's log earnings results from a growth rate in earnings common to all persons; from changes in observed (Z) and unobserved () individual time-varying characteristics (such as the accumulation of schooling, experience, or.",

The simulation reveals social immobility in evolutionary equilibria in a world with two social classes divided by educational attainments, but the equilibrium share of the educated population exhibits neutral stability. As a result, even without the concern on equality and social mobility, the government may still intervene in the economy to improve aggregate social welfare. However, the chaotic property of the non-linear dynamic system exhibits unpredictability near the ending states.",
    "820": "AbstractWe argue that stability and increasing fluidity coexist in the contemporary Japanese social stratification system. It is often argued that the weakening of Japanese employment practices has made the labor market more flexible. While there is evidence to support this argument, it misses an important factor in the labor market, namely social stratification. We suggest that some parts of the labor market have become more fluid, while other parts have been stable. To test this prediction, we examine empirical findings made in the 2005 Social Stratification and Social Mobility Survey Project, covering such topics as education and inequality, increasing fluidity and disparity among young workers, job changes, and income inequality. Our findings on education and inequality show that stratification in the educational system affects the entry of graduates into regular or non-regular employment. Our analysis of young workers shows that while the longterm employment practice persists in large firms and the public sector and thus shows stability, mobility between regular and non-regular employment is difficult and that young female graduates from high schools and junior colleges recently find it difficult to enter the regular employment sector. Our analysis of the effect of education on job changes shows that the income of less educated workers who change jobs has decreased recently. We also find increasing income inequality between professionals and other occupations and examine the intergenerational transmission of income. We conclude that these findings generally support our prediction that stability and increasing fluidity coexist in the contemporary Japanese labor market. We consider the implications of this for the study of social stratification in Japan.Keywords: social stratificationfluiditystability Notes* This paper is based on I thank the Japan Sociological Society for their permission to publish an English version of it.

I show that parents' bequest division will be affected by the intrinsic mobility structure of the society, contrary to previous causality conjecture. Although an unequal division of bequests widens the within-generation inequality, it may increase the intergenerational upward mobility for the well-endowed child, which in turn improves the originally rigid upward mobility of the poor and middle-income groups and, as a result, reduces the steady-state income inequality.",

    "826": "Most developed countries have family policies, but little is known about their macroeconomic consequences. This paper develops a heterogeneous agent overlapping generations framework that integrates trade-offs between the number of children (quantity) and investment per child (quality) a rich demographic structure, and childcare choices. Calibrating the model to U.S. data and validating it with quasi-experimental evidence, I find that raising aggregate fertility to the replacement level requires a $30,000 cash reward to childbirth, similar to the expansion of the Child Tax Credit in the past decade (in net present value) Contrary to conventional wisdom, such a policy reduces average human capital and intergenerational mobility. The key to this result is that the marginal cost of child quality rises with fertility, and fertility effects of the policy are larger among parents with lower income. Nevertheless, average well-being rises by 1.6% in the long run as the old-age dependency ratio drops, requiring lower taxes to sustain retirement benefits. This gain in long-run welfare comes with higher public spending in transition, which may hurt existing households depending on how the policy is funded. Compared with cash rewards, in-kind benefits are less cost-effective in raising fertility but have other advantages: subsidized childcare encourages parents to work, while expansions of public education improve children's human capital and intergenerational mobility.",
    "827": "This paper estimates peer effects both from parents to children and from older to younger siblings in academic fields of study in high school. Despite the importance of family peer effects, causal evidence is scarce due to correlated unobservables and a lack of data. Our setting is Sweden, where admission to oversubscribed majors is determined based on a student's GPA. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find large intergenerational and sibling peer effects that depend on the gender mix of a dyad. Younger brothers are 25% more likely to choose the major their older brother enrolls in, but 25% less likely to copy their older sister. Younger sisters copy older sisters (18% increase) but not older brothers. Effects vary based on birth spacing and whether a major is gender conforming. Turning to the effect of parental completion of a major, sons are 22% and 18% more likely follow in the footsteps of their fathers and mothers, respectively. In contrast, parents have little effect on their daughters' choices, except when a mother majors in the male-dominated program of Engineering. Since high school majors have a strong link to future occupation and earnings, these within family spillovers have long-term consequences for intergenerational income mobility and gender wage gaps. Finally, correlations greatly overstate these causal spillover effects, and miss heterogeneity by gender mix.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

This paper shows that the income-education association varies greatly across groups of children with different versions of a specific gene, monoamine-oxidase A (MAOA) which impacts neurotransmitter activity. For children with one MAOA variant, increases in household income have the expected positive association with education. For children with another variant, who comprise over half of the population, this relationship is much weaker. These results hold when the interactive effects are identified using genetic variation between full biological siblings, which genetic principles assert is as good as randomly assigned.",
    "838": "Wealth inequality is one of the most pervasive problems of our times. This article contends that family business groups deserve special examination because they create and control vast amounts of private wealth that are passed through inheritance to future generations. Despite their economic importance, little has been done to investigate to what extent family business groups contribute to wealth inequality. This study offers an economic and legal perspective of the topic and shows that family business groups reify existing power structures that sustain wealth concentration. This article shows that intergenerational transfers (capital and non-capital) and the use of the code of law are powerful mechanisms that help to explain why family business groups reinforce existing wealth inequality, a state of affairs that has persisted over time. However, this article also shows that family business groups can increase the distribution of wealth through philanthropy and ethical business practices that can dismantle class hierarchies and create opportunities for disadvantaged groups. Thus, this article concludes that family business groups play a paradoxical role. They create wealth inequality due to their societal and economic power, but they can also create opportunities for upward social mobility for underprivileged communities.",

We develop an overlapping generations model in which human capital formation depends on individual effort and educational resources. Parents vote on redistributive policies under majority rule by considering the disincentive effects of high tax rates on childrens study efforts. We characterize the stationary Markov perfect equilibrium in which children respond negatively to the extent of redistribution, and parental altruism discourages poor voters from expropriating the rich. Under private education, a tax rate is only credible above a certain threshold, and childrens efforts and their parental inputs are complements in the steady state. Under public education, a credible policy embodies a moderate income tax combined with a small educational fund. Under both school systems, the optimal credible tax increases with wage inequality and decreases as parental altruism becomes stronger.",

    "865": "Numerous studies have found that income inequality reduces the chances of upward relative mobility (i.e. climbing up the income ladder) However, most of this work ignores the role played by institutional quality (namely, economic freedom) in determining mobility and increasing the individual's set of choices. We fill this gap by empirically testing the direct and indirect (through economic growth) impacts of economic freedom on intergenerational income mobility. We find that economic freedom has both direct and indirect effects on intergenerational income mobility, while income inequality is a strong predictor of downward income mobility. When we incorporate findings about the purely mechanical relationship between inequality and intergeneration income mobility, we find that the legal system and property rights component of economic freedom matters more than inequality. These results suggest that good institutions can increase intergenerational income mobility.",
    "868": "After a period of relatively strong economic and social mobility during the post-WWII decades, labour income is now quickly losing its capacity to fuel mobility across the wealth distribution of Western economies, with inheritance becoming again the main determinant of individuals ability to make it to the top of the wealth distribution. At a time where inheritance taxation therefore seems desirable from both equity and efficiency standpoints, most inheritance tax systems are broken. They have failed to be truly progressive, and have remained very unpopular among the public. In this paper, we propose general principles to guide an in-depth reform of inheritance tax systems, to make them more efficient, progressive and transparent. Using administrative survey data from France, we also discuss whether the revenue generated by these reforms can promote equality of opportunities, by guaranteeing a wealth endowment for all. Based on detailed simulations, we explain why inheritance taxation alone cannot deal with the current dynamics of concentration of wealth at the top of the distribution, and why it needs to be complemented by progressive taxation of wealth and/or capital income.

Sorting by income into schools accounts for a large portion of the variation in the income-achievement gap across all student groups. In addition, our results suggest that the large income-achievement gap for Indigenous students may be rooted in inequality in health outcomes and poor housing conditions.

The main result is that migration is considerably influential in shaping the high rates of economic mobility observed among children from low-wage areas, with human capital investment behavioral responses being important to consider. Equalizing school quality across locations does more to reduce interstate inequality in income mobility than equalizing skill prices, and policies that attempt to decrease human capital flight from low-wage areas via cash transfers are unlikely to be cost-effective.",

    "953": "This study analyzes the interactions between population dynamics with differential fertility the intergenerational mobility and economic development. Population dynamics with differential fertility exerts the following two effects on the economy: (i) the change in the population size of the entire economy influences the mobility through changing in the composition of workers and (ii) the decreasing/increasing transfer per child influences the mobility. A sufficient increase in the population growth increases the population size and leads to a significant decline in the transfers per child; this phenomenon contributes toward the cyclical behavior of mobility and income inequality. On the other hand, when a population growth decreases, the mobility monotonically approaches toward steady state. These results are consistent with some empirical evidence. Hence, this study demonstrates that the population dynamics with differential fertility leads to a difference in transitional dynamics of intergenerational mobility and the process of economic development.",
    "955": "This article analyzes how property price rises have affected household assets and liabilities using household microdata. Over the past several years, households have accumulated wealth rapidly on the back of price hikes in real estate. But the pace of wealth growth has been uneven depending on the size of household wealth. High-net-worth households have accumulated wealth at a faster pace with a greater contribution of property price increases compared to household income. In Korea, high-net-worth households tend to own a larger share of their total assets in real estate. For that reason, a steep rise in property prices has a larger impact on wealthy households, thereby widening the wealth gap. In addition, the effect of property price rises on the household balance sheet has been heterogeneous across generations. Especially, financial liabilities held by households with heads aged 25-44, who have a relatively lower homeownership rate, have ballooned during the recent housing market boom.From the perspective of economic mobility, wealth mobility is lower than income mobility. Accordingly, the wealth gap which has been widened due to the property price increases is likely to persist. Furthermore, the quality and composition of financial liabilities of households with heads aged 25-44 have deteriorated. The proportion of heavily indebted households in the group has increased more sharply. And the purpose of loans taken out has varied depending on their household wealth. To be specific, the share of loans for leasehold (jeonse) or security deposits has been increasing among households in their bottom 60% net worth segment, while the share of loans for residential housing purchases has been increasing overall among households in their top 40%.It is noteworthy that households in Korea regard real estate as a primary means of wealth accumulation. In this regard, more policy attention should be paid to the distribution of wealth as well as housing stability. Also, thorough monitoring of developments and risk factors in the housing market is needed to prevent financial vulnerabilities from materializing.",

To do so, we construct a general equilibrium overlapping generations model with intergenerational linkages, a higher education choice as well as a multi-stage human capital production process during childhood and adolescence with parental and government schooling investments. The model features rich cross-sectional heterogeneity, distinguishes between single and married parents, and is disciplined by US household survey data on income, wealth, education and time use. Studying the transitions induced by unexpected policy reforms we show that the \"free college\" and the \"better schools\" reform generate significant welfare gains, which take time to materialize and are lower in general than in partial equilibrium. It is optimal to combine both reforms: tuition subsidies make college affordable even for children from poorer parental backgrounds and better schools increase human capital thereby reducing dropout risk.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at",

Using CGSS data and an ordered probit model, it empirically examines the causal relationship between housing inequality and residents' subjective social status. The research indicates that housing inequality significantly influences residents' social status perception. The greater the quantity of housing and the larger the living space, the higher the residents' subjective social status. This conclusion remains robust after conducting sensitivity tests. Mechanistic analyses show that the wealth effect is the transmission pathway through which housing inequality affects individuals' social status perceptions. Heterogeneity analyses showed that housing inequality significantly exacerbated social stratification, which was particularly evident in age. Further analysis reveals that housing assets not only have significant impacts on the present but also serve as a key factor in enhancing intergenerational mobility in the future. This study explains the drivers of residents' social status perceptions from the perspective of housing inequality, and provides empirical evidence and policy insights for China to improve the long-term mechanism of real estate, and to prevent the risk of social status perceptions divergence due to housing allocation.",

Design/methodology/approach This article construct regression models to examine the relationship between filial piety concepts and wages. Also, it uses unconditional quantile regression and decomposition to explore the impact of filial piety concepts on the wage gap. Findings It is found that: (1) The effects of two-dimensional filial piety are heterogeneous in terms of gender. Specifically, authoritarian filial piety significantly suppresses individual wages and has a stronger suppressive effect on womens wages, whereas affinity filial piety significantly enhances individual wages without gender heterogeneity; (2) Parents' time support in the intergenerational exchange model is a crucial mechanism by which filial piety affects wages, exhibiting significant gender heterogeneity; (3) Regarding wage distribution, authoritarian filial piety mainly widens the gender income gap in the low and middle income-groups, while affinity filial piety narrows the gender wage gap by raising the floor, with its converging effect being most significant in the middle and high-income groups.

    "977": "Brazil, as the most unequal and populous country in Latin America, demands a closer examination of its patterns and trends of social stratification. With an emphasis on recent contributions, the paper reviews the literature on four major areas of stratification research: race relations and inequality, educational stratification, intergenerational mobility, and income inequality. The literature on racial stratification focuses on the following subjects: racial classification, discrimination, marital selectivity, educational stratification, and intergenerational mobility. In addition, educational stratification literature concerning trends and patterns is reviewed with special attention to studies advanced by sociologists of social stratification. Intergenerational mobility studies are also presented and discussed. Finally, studies on income and wealth inequality are reviewed. In all these areas the contribution of sociologists is highlighted, and trends and patterns of stratification are presented.",
    "985": "Families are widely recognized as crucial agents in the transmission of wealth, contributing to the perpetuation of inequality and limiting mobility across income levels. To address the economic dynamics behind this phenomenon, classical economists have explored potential solutions through government tax-transfer systems. One such proposal, advanced by Eugenio Rignano, suggests imposing higher taxes on inheritances passed down through multiple generations within a family. To analyze this idea, a model is developed that incorporates both altruistic and accidental bequests, with altruistic bequests playing a crucial role in wealth transmission. The model considers the potential disincentives that inheritance taxation might create for savings intended for altruistic bequests, as well as the benefits of taxing accidental bequests. The novelty of the model lies in its characterization of optimal inheritance taxes when there is an interaction between parents' educational decisions for their children and the transmission of wealth. Simulations suggest that adopting Rignano's proposed tax scheme enhances social welfare compared to the commonly used proportional inheritance tax. These findings suggest that Rignano's tax scheme warrants further research and policy discussion.",
    "994": "This paper examines the role of social networks, specifically family, peers, and community, in influencing economic mobility in low-income urban areas, where access to opportunities is often constrained by education, employment, and social connections. Drawing on qualitative interviews and survey data, the study investigates how social capital structure and dynamics enable or hinder individuals' access to key resources for education, employment, and mentorship. The findings highlight the dual nature of family structures, where intergenerational support can serve as a pathway to economic mobility or function as a mechanism of exclusion. Additionally, peer networks and community ties are explored to understand how informal channels, such as employment referrals and social support, contribute to financial success and mobility. The paper also critically examines the intersections of race, gender, and social class, revealing how these factors can exacerbate or limit individuals' ability to leverage social capital for improved economic standing. By analysing these dynamics, this study underscores the significant role of social capital in shaping economic outcomes and offers policy recommendations for fostering community-based approaches that open avenues for economic opportunities. Ultimately, the research illustrates how social networks, whether through support or exclusion, can either perpetuate or mitigate poverty, depending on the unequal distribution of resources within urban environments.",
    "1000": "In her recent article, Inheriting Inequality: Wealth, Race and the Laws of Succession, Palma Joy Strand unpacks the connection between social mobility and inherited wealth. She situates this discussion within the broader picture of the increasing gap between rich and poor in the United States. Strand isolates the role of race in that trend and she argues that the transmission of inherited wealth, as much if not more than income levels, is a dominant predictor of whether a family will move between classes in American society. Her goal is to develop a theory of the relationship between inheritance and the reproduction of our economic structure. It is an ambitious goal and Strand makes substantial steps toward it in this article.",
    "1006": "Contrary to a standard theoretical approach, evidence suggests that low income inequality, and high public school funding are not systematically as- sociated with high level of social mobility. The seminal paper of Checchi and al. (1999) oers an explanation to the puzzling situation some coun- tries experiment in this regard. They emphasize the role of incentives in the human capital accumulation process in private versus public school fund- ing. This paper proposes an extension of this model to account for mixed school regime. Two main ndings result from numerical computations of the model. (1) More decentralized nancing of school spending results in higher incentives for households to invest privately in their children's edu- cation. Consequently, the more decentralized schooling system, the higher social mobility and income inequality. (2) For a given school regime, higher level of intergenerational mobility translates into a lower level of income inequality because it strengthens households'demand for public spending in education. These two forces may explain why empirical evidence fails to detect the existence of a simple relation between public education, social mobility, and income inequality.",
    "1007": "Esta tesis analiza temas de distribucion de la renta y desarrollo economico en economias caracterizadas por imperfecciones en el mercado de capitales. El primer capitulo estudia temas de distribucion de la renta. La mayoria de la literatura en ese campo a sido desarrollada bajo el supuesto que IMC (esto es imperfecciones en el mercado de capitales) son exogenas. La teoria convencional es que es muy poco probable que los individuos mas pobres puedan invertir porque tomar dinero a prestamo es muy caro en presencia de asimetrias informativas. Consecuentemente, los individuos mas pobres no invertiran y sus futuras generaciones permaneceran pobres. Basado en esta linea de pensamiento esta literatura concluye que IMC exogenas producen mayor desigualdad y menor movilidad intergeneracional. Contrariamente as estos analisis este articulo argumenta que cuando las IMC se endogenizan la movilidad intergeneracional aumentara entre los pobres e inteligentes individuos. En mi modelo existe un problema de seleccion adversa entre el prestamista y el prestatario, pues los bancos no saben la habilidad del prestatario. En este contexto los bancos ofrecen un menu de contratos que satisface la condicion de auto-seleccion. En equilibrio bancos diferencian entre agentes forzando a los mas inteligentes a invertir en educacion mas de lo optimo. De esta forma el agente menos inteligente no se hace pasar por el agente mas inteligente. Estos ultimos obtienen mas educacion de la que ellos desean, aumentando movilidad intergeneracional y la acumulacion de capital humano, que son mayores que en el mundo con informacion perfecta. Los resultados mas importantes de este paper son los siguientes: cuando se endogenizan las imperfecciones del mercado de capitales obtenemos que IMC aumentan movilidad intergeneracional y aumenta el numero de gente educados en el estado estacionario. Al estudiar desigualdad en renta, yo encuentro que los resultados son ambiguos. Por un lado el numero de gente con rentas muy bajas ha disminuido. Por otro lado la clase media de prestatarios inteligentes tienen una renta menor. Una de las cuestiones mas importantes que se hacen los economistas es porque paises pobres usan sus recursos de forma ineficiente. En el segundo capitulo nosotros (Andres Erosa y yo) proponemos una teoria donde IMC son el origen de las diferencias en TFP entre paises. En nuestra teoria los empresarios tienen informacion privada sobre la productividad de su tecnologia. Nosotros estudiamos como el contrato, descrito como la habilidad de hacer respetar el contrato, afecta la provision de incentivos, y por tanto, y de repartir los recursos entre los empresarios. Nosotros estudiamos un modelo de crecimiento donde los empresarios estan dotados de una tecnologia para producir un bien intermedio que es el input de la produccion final de bienes. Los empresarios necesitan financiacion externa para producir. Esta financiacion externa esta limitada por dos problemas: Primero, la productividad no es observable para los prestamistas. Segundo, los empresarios pueden pagar, como maximo, una fraccion de la produccion. Asumimos que los paises difieren en su capacidad de hacer respetar los contratos. Demostramos que, en la presencia de asimetrias de informacion, paises con baja capacidad de hacer respetar los contratos utilizan tecnologias ineficientes en equilibrio y es caracterizada por diferencias en productividad entre paises. Nuestra teoria sugiere que los empresarios tienen intereses en mantener en status quo con baja capacidad de hacer cumplir los contratos y esto hace posible que los empresarios extraigan rentas de los servicios que contratan. Nuestra teoria tiene implicaciones sobre la distribucion de los recursos entre sectores. En fin nuestra teoria implica que la tasa de impuestos sobre la renta puede ser mala para la actividad economica sobre todo cuando los mercados de capitales son imperfectos. This dissertation analyzes income distribution and economic development issues in macroeconomies with financial frictions. Chapter 1 focuses on income distribution issues. Most of the existing literature in this area has been developed under the assumption that CMI are exogenous. Their conventional view is that since becoming borrower is expensive under high imperfections in the capital markets, poor agents are less likely to make investment decisions. As a consequence their future generations will remain poor. Based on this thought these branch of the literature conclude that exogenous CMI lead to higher inequality and lower mobility. In contrast to these analyses this paper argues that when we endogenize CMI, intergenerational mobility may be promoted among poor and talented agents. In my model there is an adverse selection problem between borrowers and banks, since banks cannot identify borrowers ability. In this context banks offer a menu of contracts that satisfy the self-selection mechanism. In equilibrium banks differentiate between agents by forcing talented borrowers to make an investment in human capital larger than they would in the first best world. In this way low ability individuals do not pose as high ability ones. Talented children from poor families get educated even more than they wish, so that both income mobility and human capital accumulation are larger than in the first best world. The major results of this paper might be summarized as follows: when we endogenize imperfections in the capital market we obtain that CMI promotes intergenerational mobility and increases the number of educated people in the steady state. When we study inequality of wealth, we find that there are opposite effects making inequality unambiguos. On the one hand there is a small number of people in the lower bound of the wealth distribution. On the other hand the middle class of clever borrowers have a lower wealth. One of the most important research questions faced by economist is why poor countries use productive resources inefficiently. In the second chapter of the thesis we propose a theory where capital market imperfections are at the origin of cross-country TFP differences. In our theory entrepreneurs have private information about the multifactor productivity of their technology. We study how the contracting environment, as described by the ability to enforce contracts, affects the provision of incentives and, thus, resource allocation to and across entrepreneurs. We develop a growth model where entrepreneurs are endowed with a technology to produce an intermediate good that is an input in the production of final goods. Entrepreneurs need external funds in order to operate their technology. External financing is complicated by two problems: First, the productivity of the entrepreneurial technology can not be observed by lenders. Second, entrepreneurs can commit to pay, at most, a fraction of the output. We assume that countries differ in the ability to enforce loans contracts. We show that, in the presence of asymmetric information, countries with low enforcement use inefficient technologies in equilibrium and are characterized by differences in productivity across industries. Our theory also suggests that entrepreneurs have a vested interest in maintaining a status quo with low enforcement since it allows them to extract rents from the factor services they hire. Our theory has implications for the allocation of resources across industries that differ in their needs of external funds and provide some insights into why poor countries face large differences in productivity across sectors. Our theory also implies that income taxation can be more detrimental for economic activity when capital markets are imperfect."
