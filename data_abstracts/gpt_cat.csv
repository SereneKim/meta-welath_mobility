https://openalex.org/W623315094,No,"The paper primarily focuses on the system of peasant reproduction, specifically geographic mobility, household formation, and the family‐land bond rather than on inter/multigenerational wealth/income/earning mobility.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
https://openalex.org/W623596649,Yes,The paper focuses on intergenerational earnings mobility by estimating the elasticities between children’s and parents’ incomes. It specifically examines differences by gender and the role of educational attainment in influencing mobility.,Yes,"The measures mentioned include intergenerational earnings elasticities, which are calculated for sons and daughters with respect to their mother’s and father’s incomes, with additional analysis based on differences in educational attainment.",N/A,Yes,N/A
https://openalex.org/W655971325,Yes,"The paper discusses intergenerational mobility by evaluating an educational reform in Sweden and shows that it produced a sizable increase in intergenerational income mobility, as well as reduced the educational association between parents and children.",Yes,"It uses measures such as comparing parental and child outcomes to assess intergenerational income mobility and the strength of educational associations. It further employs identification strategies (identical twins, adoptees, instrumental variables) to isolate the effects.",N/A,Yes,N/A
https://openalex.org/W70509848,Yes,"The paper examines intergenerational and multigenerational mobility by critiquing the use of iterated intergenerational regression measures. It argues that repeatedly applying intergenerational estimates can overstate long-run mobility, even if the direct intergenerational mobility appears low.",Yes,"It discusses intergenerational regression measures, particularly how iterating these measures (such as parental income effects) is used to predict long-run mobility.",N/A,No,Yes
https://openalex.org/W70760627,No,"The paper is primarily focused on understanding how home‐grown entrepreneurs in Suzhou are able to achieve social mobility by cultivating and using various forms of social capital in a hybrid Chinese economy, rather than exploring inter/multigenerational wealth/income/earning mobility.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
https://openalex.org/W765699370,Yes,"The paper investigates intergenerational income mobility by examining how persistence in income, as well as cognitive and non-cognitive skills, varies across different levels of parental income using NLSY data.",Yes,The paper employs the varying coefficient model (VCM) to estimate nonparametric local measures of intergenerational mobility by modeling persistence coefficients as smooth functions of log parental permanent income.,N/A,Yes,N/A
https://openalex.org/W82682215,Yes,"The paper investigates how parental divorce affects child outcomes, particularly educational and occupational attainment, and argues that these effects vary by socio-economic background, thereby influencing intergenerational mobility.",Yes,"The paper uses measures such as educational attainment, occupational outcomes, and parental income at age 16 to study intergenerational mobility.",N/A,Yes,N/A
https://openalex.org/W85222481,Yes,"The paper discusses intergenerational income mobility by showing that for a given school regime, a higher level of intergenerational mobility is associated with lower income inequality, as it reinforces households’ demand for public education spending. It also highlights that more decentralized school financing incentivizes private education investments, which in turn impacts both social mobility and inequality.",No,N/A,The paper focuses on extending a theoretical model and uses numerical computations rather than listing explicit empirical measures to assess intergenerational mobility.,N/A,Yes
https://openalex.org/W8680042,Yes,"The paper argues that when capital market imperfections are endogenized, talented individuals from poor families invest in human capital beyond their optimal level, which enhances intergenerational mobility. It shows that this mechanism leads to higher mobility and greater human capital accumulation than in a setting with perfect information.",No,N/A,The paper is primarily theoretical and does not specify empirical measures or indices to quantify intergenerational mobility.,No,Yes
https://openalex.org/W981513404,No,"The paper primarily focuses on household structure and occupational social mobility, rather than analyzing inter/multigenerational wealth/income/earning mobility.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
