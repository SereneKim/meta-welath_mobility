Our analysis, which tracks movements across quintiles, centers on four questions: How much movement is there across the family income distribution? How has this mobility changed over time? To what extent are the movements attributable to factors related to changes in family composition versus events in the labor markets? In light of major socioeconomic changes occurring in the quarter-century under study, have the determinants of mobility changed over time? Our findings indicate that mobility rates in the 1980s differed little from those in the 1970s. However, individuals in families headed by a young person or a person without a college education were less likely to experience upward mobility in the 1980s than in the 1970s.\n",

The model can be identified through the covariance structure of earnings within individuals and across generations. Based on the models, I simulate the lifetime income of both generations and calculate the implied intergenerational elasticity.Using PSID data from the United States and GSOEP data from Germany, the estimated intergenerational elasticity of fathers and sons is substantially higher than those in the literature.

      "Updating it to Existing studies on intergenerational income mobility have two main flaws: biased downward estimate and omission of government spending. To address these problems, this paper provides the consistent estimate of the intergenerational income elasticity in China, and also extends the standard model by incorporating government spending into it. It is found by IV estimate that China's intergenerational correlation in long-term income is 0.830, and paradoxically, government spending in public education fails to effectively make the society more mobile. However, by measuring the effect of the Compulsory Education Law using the DID method, this paper finds that public education has significantly raised the beneficiaries' income by 43%. Therefore, although public education appears to have a rather restrictive effect in the short run, increase in government spending aimed at poor families helps to mitigate the intergenerational transmission of economic status in the long run. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\n",

      "Updating it to This paper analyzes theoretically and empirically the impact of intergenerational transmission of human capital on the income mobility in China. We use a three-period overlapping-generations (OLG) model to show that the human capital transfer plays a remarkable role in determining the parent-to-offspring investment in human capital and the intergenerational elasticity of income. We then estimate a simultaneous equations model (SEM) using the 1989-2009 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data to verify our theoretical predictions. The results show that (i) human capital, measured by health and education, is directly transmitted from one generation to the next, reflecting the parent-induced inequality of development opportunities among offspring in China; (ii) the estimated intergenerational income elasticity increases from 0.429 to 0.481 when the direct transfer of human capital is accounted for, suggesting that omitting this mechanism would overestimate China's income mobility. Our findings provide policy implications on strengthening human capital investments among the disadvantaged groups, reinforcing reforms that promote equality of opportunity, and improving the efficiency of labor markets in China.\n",

      "Updating it to Conventional wisdom and previous literature suggest that economic mobility is lower at the tails of the income distribution. However, the few studies that have estimated intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) at different points of the distribution in the U.S. were limited by small samples, arrived at disparate results, and had not estimated the trend of elasticity over time. Using the PSID database, a large sample of income observations in the 1980–2010 period for the U.S. is built, which allows us to obtain robust quantile estimates of the IGE both for the pooled sample and for each wave. For the pooled sample, the IGE shows a U-shaped relation with the income distribution, with higher values at the tails (0.64 at the tenth percentile and 0.48 at the ninety-fifth percentile) and a minimum value –highest mobility- of 0.38 at the seventieth percentile. The trend evolution of the IGE also varies across the income distribution: at the lower and mid quantiles, income mobility increased during the 80s and 90s but declined in the 00s, while for the higher quantiles it remained relatively stable along the whole period. Finally, the impact of education and race on mobility is evaluated. Both factors are found to be important and related to the position at the income distribution.\n",

      "Updating it to This paper analyses the effects of innate ability, compulsory education (grades 1-9), and non-compulsory education (grades 10-12 and higher education) on inequality and intergenerational mobility of income, by constructing a four-period overlapping-generation model. We find that innate ability and family investment in early education play important roles in explaining income inequality and intergenerational income mobility. Though children from the wealthiest families are only 1.36 times 'smarter' that those from the poorest, the gap in human capital expands to 2.35 at the end of compulsory education and to 2.89 at the end of non-compulsory education. One important reason for the increase is that poor families invest relatively less in children's early education than do wealthy families; therefore, their children attend lower-quality schools, which results in them being much less likely to participate in higher education. By simulating policy experiments for different types of government education expenditure, we find that direct subsidies to poor parents are the most efficient and effective policy for mitigating poor families' budget constraints with regard to early-education investment in their children.\n",

      "Updating it to Wealth inequality between the top and bottom deciles has grown over the last 20 years (Piketty and Zucman in Wealth and inheritance in the long run, Centre for Economic Policy Research, London, 2014), as has the racial wealth gap (Shapiro et al. in The roots of the widening racial wealth gap: explaining the black–white economic divide. Institute on Assets and Social Policy, Brandeis University, Waltham, 2013. http://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf). Within these broad trends of inequality, some families are able to get ahead and grow their wealth, while others are not. Yet we do not understand well the critical variables that increase the likelihood of wealth mobility across the life course—within the same generation. This paper addresses this gap and investigates the following questions: What accounts for intra-generational relative and absolute wealth mobility for families with children in the first decade of the twenty-first century? And how does it differ by race? The paper draws on two longitudinal data sets—the Panel Study of Income Dynamics household survey data matched with neighborhood-level US Census data (1999–2011), and the IASP Leveraging Mobility (LM) study (1998–2011). Applying an integrated mixed methods design, analyses are conducted in three stages: (1) A grounded theory analytic approach of the LM data determines key variables of wealth mobility: homeownership, income, employment characteristics, extended family wealth, negative life events, and neighborhood factors; (2) regression analyses test these indicators for absolute and relative wealth mobility; and (3) recontextualization through further analyses of LM data deepen the regression results by illustrating the pathways of significant wealth mobility predictors. Results reveal that increasing family income, larger family transfers, consistent long-term homeownership, and in some cases white-collar occupations increase the likelihood of upward relative wealth mobility. Negative life events, higher rates of neighborhood poverty, and black race are negatively correlated with the amount of wealth growth. These key drivers of wealth mobility highlight the need for targeted policies that reinforce and expand opportunities for all families to build wealth over the life course.\n",

      "Updating it to The declining prevalence of two-parent families helped increase income inequality over recent decades. Does family structure also condition how economic (dis)advantages pass from parents to children? If so, shifts in the organization of family life may contribute to enduring inequality between groups defined by childhood family structure. Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, I combine parametric and nonparametric methods to reveal how family structure moderates intergenerational income mobility in the United States. I find that individuals raised outside stable two-parent homes are much more mobile than individuals from stable two-parent families. Mobility increases with the number of family transitions but does not vary with children’s time spent coresiding with both parents or stepparents conditional on a transition. However, this mobility indicates insecurity, not opportunity. Difficulties maintaining middle-class incomes create downward mobility among people raised outside stable two-parent homes. Regardless of parental income, these people are relatively likely to become low-income adults, reflecting a new form of perverse equality. People raised outside stable two-parent families are also less likely to become high-income adults than people from stable two-parent homes. Mobility differences account for about one-quarter of family-structure inequalities in income at the bottom of the income distribution and more than one-third of these inequalities at the top.\n",

      "Updating it to Existing research linking prior military employment with labor market outcomes has focused on comparing the relative income of veterans and nonveterans. However, people who join the armed forces are uniquely selected from the broader population, and the form and direction of selectivity has shifted over time, with differential enlistment rates by race, region, and socioeconomic status. Understanding changes in the demographic composition of enlistees and veterans has significant import for the study of social mobility, particularly given changes in the occupational structure since the mid-twentieth century and wage stagnation well into the new millennium. Furthermore, labor market polarization and increases in educational attainment since WWII raise additional concerns about the social origins of military personnel and their occupational trajectories after discharge. Using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys, we investigate how social background is linked to both income and occupational mobility among veterans from three cohorts of American men: World War II, Vietnam, and the All-Volunteer Force. We find few benefits for veterans, for either income or intergenerational occupational mobility, once social background is controlled, suggesting that selection into the armed forces largely governs outcomes in the civilian labor market. Our findings have significant importance for understanding civilian labor market outcomes and trajectories of social mobility during distinct phases of military staffing.\n",

The 4824 parents-children pairs are used for the analysis. This study provides evidence that additional government spending contributes to promoting intergenerational income mobility. Moreover, government spending moderates the effects of income inequality on intergenerational income mobility. This evidence indicates that government spending plays a role in preventing the decrease in intergenerational income mobility by offsetting the consequences of income inequality.\n",

We use an instrumental variable approach to identify the causal effect of upward income mobility on adult health.

Particularly, the evidence that greater income inequality decreases intergenerational income mobility is clearer when interstate migration problems are addressed. This evidence indicates that income inequality matters since it hinders the equal opportunity to succeed, especially for children from low-income families. If equality of opportunity is a value for policymakers, it provides justification for policy interventions and government efforts to reduce income inequality.

Most of the available evidence for developing countries, instead, relies on co-resident households and two-sample instrumental variables approach, and findings in the mobility literature suggest that these approaches could introduce bias in the IGE estimates. The current study rectifies this important omission for rural India, and develops strategies that will be useful for similar research in other developing countries. Using a panel dataset spanning 1994–2012, I find that the intergenerational income persistence for rural India is lower than analogous evidence from other developing countries (IGE: 0.30 [se:0.03]).

      "Updating it to This paper introduces new techniques to obtain a closed-form rank-by-rank characterization of the equilibrium distribution of wealth in a model in which finitely lived households face uninsurable idiosyncratic investment risk. A central result is that the extent of inequality is determined entirely by two factors. The first factor, household exposure to idiosyncratic investment risk, increases inequality. The second factor, cross-sectional mean reversion of household wealth, decreases inequality. We show that economic mobility is decreasing in inequality and increasing in mean reversion, a result that is consistent with recent empirical observations about the geographic variation in mobility that exists both domestically and internationally. Our approach allows us to examine the implications of increased market completeness in the form of a risk-sharing subgroup of households. We show that a risk-sharing subgroup rises or falls in the equilibrium wealth distribution depending on the level of inequality, and that its presence raises welfare and the rate of wealth accumulation for all households in the economy.\n",

      "Updating it to This paper joins a growing body of research linking measures of the physical environment to population well-being, with a focus on neighborhood toxins. Extending a national database on the social mobility of American children growing up in over 70,000 Census tracts, we explore the association between childhood exposure to two forms of pollutants and three socioeconomic outcomes for African Americans, whites, and Latinos. We find that children who grew up in Census tracts with higher levels of traffic-related air pollution and housing-derived lead risk experienced lower adult incomes on average relative to their parents and higher likelihoods of being incarcerated as an adult or having children as teenagers, after controlling for standard socio-demographic characteristics and metropolitan-level effects. The spatial distribution of these two pollutants is surprisingly different, however, with air pollution varying mostly between regions of the country while lead risk varies dramatically between neighborhoods within the same city. Yet, each pollutant predicts the three aspects of social mobility similarly, and we show important disparities in exposure by race. Differential exposure to environmental toxins in childhood may be a contributor to racial inequality in socioeconomic outcomes among adults.\n",

      "Updating it to By providing public service for equity and reducing the investment gap between rich and poor children, government spending plays a crucial role in intergenerational income mobility. With the China Health and Nutrition Survey data from 1989 to 2015, this paper assessed the relationship between government spending and intergenerational income mobility in China. First, we found that there was greater intergenerational mobility in high-spending provinces compared with low-spending provinces. Second, children with high per-capita government spending were more likely to experience upward mobility; this effect was twice as common in urban areas compared with rural areas. Third, government spending exerted influence on intergenerational income mobility through the mediation of education expansion. Higher government spending, which brought better quality in primary and secondary education, benefited poorer families more. In underdeveloped provinces, especially rural areas, government spending aimed at equal distribution of public services may provide more opportunities for the poor and lead to greater intergenerational income mobility in the future. Finally, the robustness checks that supported changing how income was measured or how government spending occurred did nothing to change our findings.\n",

      "Updating it to Using 1995 and 2005 Survey of Social Stratification and Mobility (SSM), this paper analyzes the effect of being regularly employed on intergenerational income mobility (IGM) from fathers to sons in Japan. Using Two Sample Two Stage Least Square (TS2SLS) method by which fathers’ income is imputed by their characteristics since it is unobservable, intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) between fathers and sons who are employees is estimated, and IGE is decomposed following a well-established framework. Focusing on sons born from 1935 to 1976, this paper finds that IGE increased from 1995 to 2005. The contribution rate of whether being regular employees in current job or not to IGE increased from less than 2% in 1995 to over 9% in 2005, and the increasing in IGE explained by regular employment status accounts for around 30% of increasing in IGE between father and sons who are employees from 1995 to 2005. The dominating reason for this pattern is that it had become difficult for sons from less prosperous families to find regular positions after the collapse of traditional employment structure since late 1990s. This study indicates that “how are people employed” had impeded equality of opportunities for youth and had exacerbated intergenerational transmission of income inequality in Japan.\n",

      "Updating it to Intergenerational income mobility has been widely concerned focusing mainly on the transmission mechanism within families. This paper turns to explore the structural determinants and pays special attentions to the role of intergovernmental transfer. Since the fiscal decentralization in 1990s, intergovernmental transfers become an increasingly critical part in Chinese fiscal system, balancing the fiscal capacities across regions and promoting the equalization of public goods. The question arises naturally as whether transfers targeting at equalization can boost intergenerational mobility. However, little work has investigated this intersection of studies and seldom is known about this question. This paper tries to shed some new lights. Through investigations, it confirms that intergovernmental transfers weaken the income persistence and the effect is especially significant for urban areas; the effects for the rural are mixed. Further explorations indicate that the special-purpose transfer payment has greater effects when measured during college period; notably, entering college may bring the rural children fundamental changes relative to other levels of education. In conclusion, the intergovernmental transfer system is relatively more pro-urban. To better fulfill the equalizing effect of the intergovernmental transfers on both static inequality across regions and dynamic inequality across generations, should the transfers be re-framed with cautions tilting more towards the rural.Meanwhile, the competitive behaviors and (dis)incentives of the local governments should also be taken into accounts.\n",

      "Updating it to Using a new dataset combining the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and Understanding Society (UKHLS), this paper examines the current state of intergenerational income mobility in the UK. This extends previous evidence in several directions, with a focus on younger cohorts of individuals born between 1973 and 1992. I find evidence of considerable intergenerational persistence in the transmission of resources at the household level with an intergenerational elasticity of 0.26 and a rank coefficient of 0.30. This picture of mobility remains at the individual level and under a range of robustness tests that address traditional methodological concerns. While mobility is relatively low at the national level, I find meaningful differences in income mobility rates across the country. More generally, regions with lower income in the North of England display substantially lower levels of both relative and absolute income mobility than regions in the South.\n",

      "Updating it to In this study, we examine intergenerational income mobility in Turkey using data from the Turkish Statistical Institute’s Survey of Income and Living Conditions and the TS2SLS methodology. Our findings reveal an intergenerational earnings elasticity of 0.51 between fathers and sons and 1 between fathers and daughters. This gender disparity stems from historically low female labor force participation and self-selection of women into employment in Turkey. Our estimates for household income elasticity for both sons and daughters are similar, at around 0.8. We also observe a slight decrease in intergenerational mobility for more recent birth cohorts, consistent with trends in other countries. Our further analysis using rank-rank slopes and transition matrices indicates weak intergenerational rank mobility and strong persistence at both ends of the income distribution in Turkey.\n",

      "Updating it to We provide new estimates of intergenerational income mobility in France for children born in the 1970s using rich administrative data. Since parents’ incomes are not observed, we employ a two-sample two-stage least squares estimation. We show, using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, that this method slightly underestimates rank-based measures of intergenerational persistence. Our results suggest France is characterized by a strong persistence relative to other developed countries. 9.7% of children born to parents in the bottom 20% reach the top 20% in adulthood, four times less than children from the top 20%. We uncover substantial spatial variations in intergenerational mobility across departments, and a positive relationship between geographic mobility and intergenerational upward mobility. The expected income rank of individuals from the bottom of the parent income distribution who moved towards high-income departments is around the same as the expected income rank of individuals from the 75th percentile who stayed in their childhood department.\n",

      "Updating it to This study analyzes intergenerational income mobility in Southern Brazil. Previous research has demonstrated that Brazil continues to be one of the least mobile countries in the world; however, the country has experienced strong socioeconomic advances in recent decades that may have affected mobility. The use of data from the 1982 birth cohort in the city of Pelotas, in the extreme south of Brazil, makes this one of the first studies to estimate mobility using direct observations of parental and filial income in Brazil. Using various estimation techniques, the results reveal relatively high income mobility compared with past Brazilian standards. Mobility is higher for nonwhites, extremely similar across genders, and higher among the poor. The findings indicate that increased government investment in education and reduced returns to education in recent decades are possible channels.\n",

      "Updating it to Background: Our goal in this report was to quantify the degree to which opioid prescription rates and socioeconomic correlates of income inequality predicted overdose deaths in the 1055 U.S. Midwest counties. The study follows up a state-level analysis which reported that opioid prescription rates, social capital and unemployment explained much of the variance in opioid overdose death rates (Heyman, McVicar, & Brownell, 2019). Methods: We created a data set that included drug overdose death rates, opioid prescription rates, and correlates of income inequality. Given that the variables of interest varied at the state and county level, multilevel regression was our statistical approach. Results: From 2006 to 2021, Midwest overdose drug deaths increased according to an exponential equation that closely approximated the equation that describes the increases in overdose deaths for the entire U.S. from 1978 to 2016 (e.g., Jalal et al., 2018). Retail opioid prescription sales increased from 2006 to 2012, but then declined so that by 2017 they were lower than in 2006. The regression analyses revealed that intergenerational income mobility was the strongest predictor of overdose deaths. The other consistently statistically significant predictors were opioid prescription rates, social capital, and unemployment rates. Together these predictors, plus pupil teacher ratios, single parent families, and attending college accounted for approximately 47 % of the variance in overdose death rates each year. In keeping with the decline in opioid prescription rates, the explanatory power of opioid prescription rates weakened over the course of the study. Conclusions: Overdose deaths increased at a constant exponential rate for the years that it was possible to apply our regression model. This occurred even though access to legal opioids decreased. What remained invariant was the predictive strength of intergenerational income mobility; each year it was the predictor that explained the most variance in overdose deaths.\n",

      "Updating it to The study of intergenerational income mobility has witnessed more visibility in academic and public policy circles in light of the new estimates generated by Chetty and colleagues. The distribution of race-based estimates of intergenerational income mobility demonstrates strong spatial patterning, such that the success of a child's traversal to the top income quintile in the United States is spatially conditioned and dependent on locality. However, research drawing on the new estimates of intergenerational income mobility has largely taken an aspatial approach. This study is the first attempt to develop an explicitly spatial model, demonstrating that the determinants of place-based mobility vary both geographically and across racial groups. By systematically accounting for spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity, we identify the race- and region-specific determinants of intergenerational income mobility across counties in the United States.\n",

      "Updating it to We present an empirical study on the impact of digital finance development on intergenerational income mobility. Combining nationally representative Chinese household survey data with indices for digital financial inclusion (DFI), we find that the development of digital finance leads to a lower correlation between children's income and their fathers’ income, significantly enhancing intergenerational mobility. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the DFI index is associated with a decrease in intergenerational income elasticity by 0.04–0.05. The effect is particularly pronounced in rural and inland regions. Furthermore, we find that digital finance development stimulates household entrepreneurial activities, which in turn enhance the role of digital finance in reducing intergenerational income correlation.\n",

      "Updating it to Intergenerational hierarchical solidification threatens the sustainable development of economies and societies in countries worldwide. In this paper, we match macro data on digital factor participation at the city level with micro data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies (CFPS) from 2010 to 2018 to explore whether digital factor participation can break hierarchical solidification and create opportunities for “rags to riches” on the basis of the perspective of intergenerational income mobility. We find that digital factor participation contributes to facilitating upwards income mobility between generations, alleviating intergenerational hierarchical solidification. Additionally, its marginal effects are most pronounced in the low-income groups, indicating that digital factor participation serves as a booster for “poor second generations” to leapfrog rather than an accelerator for wealth accumulation among the “wealthy second generations”. Furthermore, our research reveals that digital factor participation potentially facilitates intergenerational occupational vertical “shift” channels and promotes the horizontal migration of the labour force, which in turn weakens intergenerational transmission effects, promotes intergenerational income mobility, and breaks intergenerational hierarchical solidification. Our study highlights the importance of seizing the opportunities presented by digital factor participation, as such participation offers more equitable opportunities for the lower class, which is particularly concerning in the context of the intensifying global trend of social stratification.\n",

      "Updating it to This paper studies intergenerational income mobility using register data for 630,000 Danish children and their parents. We document substantial mobility differences across parents’ income levels. Decomposing the mobility estimates shows that for children from low-income families, intergenerational income persistence is exclusively explained by parents’ influence on children’s employment. As parents’ income increases, education becomes an increasingly dominant factor, except among children from the top-5% where intergenerational income persistence is driven by capital income likely through bequests and business contacts. Finally, we find that progressive public transfers such as those in Denmark suppress the importance of intergenerational transmission of employment. (99) JEL: I24, I30, J62\n"
